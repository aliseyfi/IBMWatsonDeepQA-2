point : just a the promise of eu membership be a strong incentive for post communist country to democratise and restructure their economy in the 1990s , the offer of a deep partnership could spur many eastern and southern mediterranean state to embrace liberal reform . concepts such a the rule of law , human right , political accountability , transparent decision making and open market be not only necessary for fair access to the eu's enormous single market , they be desirable in their own right . often they be already be campaign for by citizen in many of the non eu mediterranean country who do not enjoy their benefit at the moment , although many of their government react repressively to such demand . as the most successful project ever to promote democracy , security and prosperity , the eu have a responsibility to find way of extend these benefit to a many people a possible . catherine ashton , the foreign affair chief of the eu have say they stand ready to help egypt build a deep rooted democracy i reiterate that no matter what happen in the next hour and day , the european union stand ready to help build the deep democracy that will underpin stability for the people of egypt 1 . only if maghreb and mashriq country think the eu be serious about offer them a real economic and political partnership will their government make positive move to reform . 
counterpoint : the non eu country around the mediterranean will react badly to any eu attempt to bully or bribe them into westernise . all be on different path to reform e . g . the economic opening of libya before the overthrow of gaddafi and the very different political development in country such a turkey , morocco and lebanon . each should be allow to develop at it own pace , appropriate to local level of economic and cultural development . the eu should encourage and support such change , but should not seek to impose them ; after all , many non eu mediterranean country have bad memory of european colonial rule . there be also a danger that promote democracy and economic openness with a heavy hand will damage exist bilateral relationship in important area such a stop people traffic across the mediterranean , promote security and stability in the middle east , and combat the illegal drug trade . 
point : the change in the political world , which occur and be occur at present in some mediterranean state show that now more than ever the eu have a partner on their southern flank . the democratization of these state will make them strong and more stable , which will be of economic and political advantage to the eu . surely , this process will not be easy , but some of these country already do have the basis for it . many middle eastern state already have institution that be similar to the representative institution that a stable democracy need . arab dictator have grow adept at hold election , set up parliament , constitutional court etc . a window dress to show either to their people or to the outside world that they be reform and be 'democratic' . no matter how undemocratic these regime have be the simple existence of these institution be useful when there be a revolution a they allow some continuity and the possibility of a transition to democracy . to take egypt a an example . even under mubarak it have a parliament with the majilis al sha'ab people's assembly a it low house and majilis al shura shura council a it upper house . in both house a majority of the member be directly elected1 . egypt hold election for it parliament as recently a november 2010 , these election have very poor turnout and blatant ballot rig while the main opposition the muslim brotherhood have to stand a independents2 . 
counterpoint : what these country have now a an election and governance system be not at all close to democracy . even if people vote , this only mean they know the pure technical way , but be not familiar with the principal . you need to have live and be educate in the spirit of democracy in order to fully grasp it sense . the fake world that the suppressor in the arabic country have create do not have anything to do with a real democratic system . the rule party use to allow opposition candidate to run and then simply rig the election . before adopt a new strategy of prevent the opposition from field any candidate at all and harass those who did1 . 
point : a union for the mediterranean be an ideal foreign policy tool for the european union . it work just a the eu have work for over 50 year : by create a permanent , institutionalized dialogue , the eu can draw strategic partner into real cooperation , not just the more formal procedure of diplomacy . the end goal be to enhance the interdependence of the eu and the other mediterranean country so much , that they would effectively become a single economic unit where sovereignty be pool to solve share problem . 
counterpoint : the economic interdependence of the eu and other mediterranean country doesn't need much enhancing . already , the eu be the big trading partner of the other mediterranean country . a union can't do much more to increase that dependence . as to political cooperation and foreign policy : the eu itself be originally intend to be an economic union , not a political union . giving the eu a foreign policy tool like a union for the mediterranean be a step closer towards a european super state , and should therefore in and of itself be reject . 
point : a union for the mediterranean be a necessary foreign policy tool for the eu : it's the best way of dispel the notion of a 'clash of civilizations' . by draw the islamic country around the mediterranean into a permanent dialogue on specific policy issue and increase contact and cooperation , policy maker and opinion leader will get to know each other good , and learn how to see each other a partner , not enemy . a union for the mediterranean will eventually lead to a share sense of community and respect , a have happen with turkey . 
counterpoint : even if there be such a thing a a 'clash of civilizations' , a union for the mediterranean do nothing to dispel it . the mutual fear and distrust between people stem from cultural and ideological difference , and those can't be change by have the elite policy maker sit together regularly in a talk shop . moreover , it be unclear why cultural difference should be change : the mediterranean arab islamic culture and the european judeo christian be perfectly capable of co exist peacefully . lastly : the union for the mediterranean do nothing for the hard problem in the mediterranean : the israel palestine conflict . 
point : it be a great opportunity for the eu to create partner in the mediterranean right now . the eu should offset the dilatoriness of it response to the pro democratic demand with a decided and generous involvement in term of fund , but principally of political will in favour of democratic transition . to do so , it should abandon an approach that be focus , on the one hand , on the 'securitisation' of euro mediterranean relation and , on the other , on the belief that commercial and economic liberalisation will solve all the problem and bring about democracy and good governance . stability and prosperity in the mediterranean can be best achieve with the support of 'strong states' instead of 'fierce states' , a have be the case until now . actively foster good governance in arab country will necessarily translate into new opportunity for society and economy on both shore of the mediterranean . to do this , it be all the more necessary to resume the objective and the 'barcelona spirit' of 19951 , since it diagnosis be accurate , although there be a lack of political will , the context be adverse and the mean be not tailor to meet the end . 
counterpoint : there be an opportunity for the eu a a global actor to get involve in the current situation in the arabic world . however it be not the only global actor . there be also the united states , which also have big interest in these specific area . such close partnership to be achieve mean negotiate with one more , rather hidden part the usa . until now they have have very close relation to the leader in these region and it be likely for them to continue maintain close relationship with these country due to the economic interest . the eu can find itself in a difficult situation if it get drive in game of intrigue and political scheme .
