point : this system would be best implement by impose a mandatory 100 tax on all personal income over 150 , 000 , and all bonus over 30 , 000 . this mean that some revenue could still be raise from this if people do continue to pay large salary and bonus , although they be unlikely to do so . furthermore , it would be best implement through international cooperation , to limit the opportunity of one country to be able to offer high salary and poach talented individual . countries may agree to this a it prevent a 'race to the top' in salary , where company have to offer more and more money to attract the best people . 
counterpoint : some evasion of this be inevitable ; figure show 2 trillion of unreported income in the us in 20081 . furthermore , international cooperation be unlikely , a each country have a strong incentive to renege on agreement to attract more talented people to their country . 
point : as a result of have to pay important director and employee a low wage , business will be able to produce their good and service for a low cost , and sell therefore sell them for a low price . this will lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth , a the poor will become relatively rich , a price will fall . this will also be true for small business , which will be able to obtain cheap legal and financial advice and business consultancy , and be therefore more likely to succeed . sports provide a good example of this . in major league baseball salary for the player more than double in real term between 1992 and 2002 while ticket price rise 50 . as player wage take more than 50 of team revenues a cap would mean a significant cut in cost that could be pass on to the consumer . 1 
counterpoint : this price lower effect be most likely to be felt in those industry where the majority of the cost be in wage ; these industry be likely to be service base industry . individuals , especially poor individual , rarely buy service , so the effect on the poorest be likely to be limit . 
point : when wage be well standardize across profession , people be less likely to feel socially pressure into seek out a high paid job . as such , they be more likely to choose their job on the basis of other factor , such a how much they enjoy the job , or how ethical the working practice of a company be . this will lead to happy , and hence more productive , employee . 
counterpoint : it be equally likely that money be a significant motivator in productivity , and that limit wage will therefore harm productivity . 
point : some resource most notably housing be very important to large number of people , and own them give people a great deal of happiness . this policy will limit rich people own several property while others live in rented accommodation or small house , a price competition for such property will be less intense , and poor people will be well able to compete through saving . estimates in 2005 suggest there be 6 . 8million second home in the usa1 . this be a good thing , a it be likely that a person or family value their first property more than another person value their second property , know a the law of diminish marginal return . this be perhaps the best example of the way in which inequality lead to worse outcome for society . 
counterpoint : it be likely that foreign demand will displace national demand for property , especially in key city area such a new york or london . furthermore , have a nice house be one of the strong incentive to have a job and be a productive tax pay member of society ; loss of this incentive may decrease a society's output level and tax revenue . 
point : firstly , it limit social tension that may arise due to public dissatisfaction with high wage ; see the attack on the famous banker sir fred goodwin in the uk1 . secondly , people may feel that society recognize them a be more equal , increase the perceive self worth of many , avoid feeling of inferiority and worry about their social worth , and make them feel closer to other people . see , for example , sweden , which have the low gini coefficient indicate low level of inequality in the world , and also some of the high level of gdp per caput , life expectancy and literacy rate , and low level of crime and obesity2 . furthermore , a forbes report suggest sweden be one of the happy country in the world along with denmark , finland and norway , 3 other country with a low gini coefficient 3 . 
counterpoint : social tension be greatly exaggerated , and only actually felt when a specific crisis and against a very specific figurehead in the case of fred goodwin , an entirely isolated example , the large amount of medium coverage he receive for his role in the banking crisis . furthermore , feeling of inferiority be typically reason away by people , who explain other's great income in term of their willingness to work hard , or be lucky . the feeling of superiority over others can be consider a motivator that encourage some people to work see opposition argument one below . finally , sweden may be disanalogous a an example a they and other scandinavian country have a strong collectivist spirit that may be lack in other country .
