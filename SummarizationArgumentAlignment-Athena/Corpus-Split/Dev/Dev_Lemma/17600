point : as tony blair s former special adviser to foreign affair robert cooper have argue , fail pre modern state those without a domestic monopoly on the use of force and stable state institution pose significant threat to international peace and security because they can provide a base for non state actor include terrorist to plan and launch attack without a hindrance . invasion , or defensive imperialism afghanistan provide an example , may be the only effective response to this threat 1 . the instability in afghanistan under taliban rule , for example , make it impossible to rely on the afghanistan government to pursue al qaeda . furthermore , the taliban effectively infer al qaeda with governmental function , include the projection of force abroad 2 . in case such a this , interstate cooperation be ineffectual and armed action may be necessary . even more alarming still be the possibility of rogue state cooperate with international terrorist , and allow terrorist group to acquire weapons of mass destruction wmds or chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear cbrn weapon . pre emptive military action can protect against these threat 3 . invasion can also act a a deterrent to other regime think of support terrorism a it demonstrate to them that allow attack upon other country will result in massive retaliation and the swift overthrow of the sponsoring regime . 
counterpoint : there be scant evidence to suggest that fail state provide the condition for terrorism to prosper . while a few failed state have provide a base for terrorist , the vast majority have not 1 . moreover , in several key state that can be regard a fail or fail and where terrorist operate include yemen and pakistan invasion have not be necessary . in these state the us and it ally have build relationship with the country rule regime and have undertake highly effective method short of invasion such a drone attack and the raid on bin laden s compound which have significantly weaken terrorist network . finally , while terrorist group such a al qaeda may have a desire to use unconventional weapon such a cbrns , there be very little evidence or proof to suggest that they have the capability to execute successful attack . indeed , the use of unconventional weapon by terrorist group be rare 2 . 
point : article 51 of the u . n . charter uphold a state's right to use force in self defense against state that harbor terrorist . article 51 make reference to a state's fundamental right to self defense , and allow state to undertake certain measure in the event of an armed attack . allies may also assist in collective self defense 1 . in the case of afghanistan , the united states and it ally make distinct reference to article 51 in justify military action against the taliban regime2 . therefore , invasion in response to terrorism can be legal under international law if , a in afghanistan , it be initiate in self defense and design to deter future attack . 
counterpoint : it be evident that war against state that purportedly harbor terrorist be unlikely to satisfy the requirement of article 51 in anything other than very narrow and exceptional circumstance . self defense claim be only valid if an attack be imminent or ongoing . terrorist attack be often sporadic and the intelligence on future attack be usually unspecific , and therefore wag a war in response to terrorism do not meet the criterion for self defense . states such a afghanistan that purportedly harbor terrorist can also not be regard a aggressor and perpetrator . this would require that state instrumentally use terrorist group to attack other state , rather than simply harbor them and even have knowledge of their intent . moreover , invasion can only be legal where arm force be the only available mean of self defense . in the case of terrorism , war be unlikely to be the 'last resort' . international police action and criminal prosecution of terrorist represent alternative and more effective option , but these be deliberately neglect when war be launch against afghanistan1 . 
point : nation building have be a central element of post invasion planning for the afghanistan and iraq invasion , as well a possible future war . in afghanistan in particular , invasion couple with subsequent nation building have be successful in construct relatively stable political institution and promote economic development . in addition , effort have be make to promote women's right and tackle extremist ideology . while the military element of invasion can forcefully disrupt terrorist network and deter future attack , nation building can complement invasion through effectively tackle many of the social root of terrorism by build stable and legitimate political and economic institution to facilitate democratic governance and economic growth . humanitarian assistance and economic empowerment also offer people an alternative to join terrorist groups1 . 
counterpoint : nation building exercise be likely to fail , be far too costly , and do not reduce the threat from terrorism . moreover , there be not an inherent threat of terrorism from weak state , and where one may be present , it can be tackle through exist institutional capacity without the need for invasion or nation building . arguments for nation building also rest on very debatable assumption for example that the root of terrorism lie in poverty and lack of education which be contradict by the relatively wealthy status of many al qaeda operatives , and false analogy to the marshall plan and european reconstruction after world war ii 1 . in afghanistan , nation building have be a dismal failure , with high level of corruption cripple the country s political and economic institution , and warlord control large swath of the country while continue many of the misogynistic and violent practice of their taliban predecessor 2 .
