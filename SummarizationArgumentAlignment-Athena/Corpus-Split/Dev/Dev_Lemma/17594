point : although historically develop to finance war , the estate tax be an important continue source of revenue for the u . s . budget . if it repeal be make permanent from 2010 , then more than 1 trillion would be lose to the federal government over ten year . and remember that when the 2001 act for reduce and eventually repeal the estate tax be pass , the us federal budget be in surplus and government spending be under control . since then a range of republican tax cut and spendthrift expenditure have send the budget into heavy deficit , while the ongoing cost of war in iraq and afghanistan continue to be heavy . given that the aging of the baby boomer generation pose huge cost for the usa in term of health care , social security benefit , and a worsening dependency ratio , abolish the estate tax be a luxury america cannot afford . moreover , a theodore roosevelt point out in 1906 , 'the man of great wealth owe a particular obligation to the state because he derive special advantage from the mere existence of government'11 results . n . d . . estate tax . retrieved june 3 , 2011 , from results : the power to end poverty : 1 
counterpoint : historically , estate tax have only be enact to raise money in time of war . these tax be repeal soon after the war , therefore they be not important source of revenue , they be merely emergency source of revenue . the estate tax should have be repeal follow the end of wwi . and if the objection be to wasteful government expenditure , then the only way to cut back the size of government be to reduce the amount it have to spend . only by restrict the tax take can politician be force to cut unnecessary or wasteful program . the estate tax be a good choice of revenue to cut , a it be not only unfair and economically distort , it be also associate with high compliance cost , require an expensive government bureaucracy and a whole death tax planning industry to operate it . furthermore , a economist like martin feldstein argue , 'when the incentive effect of the tax be take into account , the net impact of the estate tax be probably to reduce overall tax revenue'1 . this be because it merely induce wealthy individual to make large charitable gift to reduce the revenue loss cause by the estate tax1 . ultimately therefore , the estate tax a public policy be fatally flaw and undermine it very intention . 1 feldstein , m . n . d . . kill the death tax now . . . retrieved june 3 , 2011 , from national bureau of economic research : 2 
point : the estate tax be a progressive tax that promote economic equality by tax the rich more than the poor . it acknowledge that luck , circumstance , and family contribute to wealth along with hard work , creativity , and sacrifice . only about 2 of americans , the very wealthy , actually pay estate tax because there be a high initial exemption level rise to 3 . 5 million in 2009 below which nothing be pay . this mean that even the very rich pay only a small percentage of the value of their entire estate if you die in 2009 leave an estate worth 5 million , only the 1 . 5 million above the threshold would actually pay any estate tax . furthermore , the need to reduce economic inequality have never be great ; in the united states the gap between the earnings of the top fifth and the bottom fifth have jump 50 since 19801 . therefore , the estate tax be vital in prevent the emergence of a 'hereditary upper class' that would institutionalise wealth and prevent it dispersal to those who work the hard and deserve the great reward1 . 1 mallaby , s . 2006 , june 5 . reward for the hereditary elite . . . retrieved june 3 , 2011 , from washington post : 7 
counterpoint : the estate tax do not encourage economic equality , for it unfairly target those who pour more of their money into the growth of their business , create job , new technology whilst ignore those who blow their wealth on holiday and luxury parties1 . specifically it target family farm and family own business , often lead to their dissolution . this be because the tax be levy on the value of the farm estate , or the business a a whole , but these be not liquid asset quickly convertible into cash . in order to pay the treasury the death tax sum demand , the land have to be break up and much of it sell , or the business have to be sell often below it true market value a it be a forced sale to generate cash . as president bush proclaim in 2005 , 'in order to make sure our farm stay within our farm family , we need to get rid of the death tax once and for all' . if fairness be the objective , there can be no fairer result than a son or daughter inherit the land and business of his father . 1 mankiw , g . 2006 , june 5 . the estate tax debate . retrieved june 3 , 2011 , from greg mankiw's blog : 8 
point : the estate tax create an incentive to leave money to charitable cause , a any sum leave to a charity be exempt from the tax calculation . this allow rich individual to exercise choice a to where their fortune go after their death , rather than leave it to the federal government to decide , but the whole of society still benefit . in this way the estate tax underpin the whole tradition of american philanthropy which do so much to enrich social , educational , cultural and environmental area of national life . a study on the effect of the estate tax on charitable give find that 'estate tax repeal would have significant deleterious effect on charitable bequest and give during life' . in 2001 , 301 decedent with gross estate in excess of 20 million give 6 . 8 million to charity , account for 42 of all charitable bequests1 . 1 bakija , j . m . , gale , w . g . 2003 , june 23 . effects of estate tax reform on charitable giving . retrieved june 3 , 2011 , from tax break : 9 
counterpoint : the only incentive the estate tax create be to try and prevent money go into the state treasury . it distort estate planning , a rich individual seek to use accountant , lawyer and specialist consultant to avoid pay money unnecessarily to the federal government . this be not only expensive , it also result in productive asset e . g . business be run down or liquidate so that money can be put into trust , insurance policy , tax free investment , etc . in the hope of reduce liability . the result of this be that financial affair become much more complicated and generally less productive in term of future income growth . 
point : the estate tax prevent the concentration of wealth in the hand of a few , avoid a plutocracy government by a wealthy ruling class . it allow the pursuit of the american dream by limit the power of old money . repealing the estate tax would also widen the gap between the poor and the wealthy , and could fuel the kind of class envy that would really threaten the property own american capitalism that so favour the wealthy . in any case , do we really want to create a class of idle rich who have do nothing themselves to create wealth , but merely inherit it ? would it even be good for the inheritor if this happen ? much good for the government to use some of these windfall to help give every american child a decent chance in life , for example through good funding for education , health , etc . the estate tax prevent the concentration of wealth in the hand of a few , avoid a plutocracy government by a wealthy ruling class . it allow the pursuit of the american dream by limit the power of old money . repealing the estate tax would also widen the gap between the poor and the wealthy , and could fuel the kind of class envy that would really threaten the property own american capitalism that so favour the wealthy . in any case , do we really want to create a class of idle rich who have do nothing themselves to create wealth , but merely inherit it ? would it even be good for the inheritor if this happen ? much good for the government to use some of these windfall to help give every american child a decent chance in life , for example through good funding for education , health , etc . 
counterpoint : it be the wealthy who drive the economy a a whole , therefore tax the wealthy do not prevent concentration , rather it prevent the accumulation of wealth for all . there would be no wealth whatsoever without the hard work , saving and prudent investment of those who will be most target by the estate tax . the prospect of not be able to hand over your lifetime's work intact to your heir create a huge disincentive to work hard build up a family farm or business , and so be bad for the economy a a whole . and even if high exemption mean few farm or business be subject to the death tax today , who can predict how future value will rise ? many businessmen will avoid expand their company in order to keep below the exemption threshold and that mean new job win t be create and the government win t benefit from increase corporate and income tax payment . better to repeal the whole tax .
