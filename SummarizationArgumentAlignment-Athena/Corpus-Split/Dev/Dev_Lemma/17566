point : the eu have slowly be build up it own common military framework , with the uk and france lead the effort to pool european military capacity . in addition , the eu itself have create new institutional body such a the political and security committee , a military committee and military staff . the eu have have military envoy in macedonia and bosnia herzegovina and have commit itself to the creation of a common security and defense policy with 3 4 , 000 troop on permanent standby in multilateral battlegroups ready for immediate deployment see rockwell schnabel s article list below 1 . while incremental , these be step not to be ignore . the union have also place that military capacity within the broad context of a security strategy design to promote international peace , justice and development . 
counterpoint : the very creation of a common military framework have be fraught with disagreement . the uk and france have only be willing to cooperate bilaterally and outside the eu framework , within a set of nationally frame security interest . both state be also very traditional military power . while some state pretend to support the creation of a credible eu military capacity , they be unwilling to contribute seriously to it construction and when face with a crisis almost always turn to the united states for military solution . while the eu do like to see itself a the diplomat of the world and flaunt it achievement with the international criminal court icc and the world trade organization wto , it still ponder the possibility of a middle of the road strategy of militarization and securitization . in the meanwhile , it continue to reside comfortably within the us sphere of military protection while act a an enfant terrible who rebel against and yet continue to accept us protection . it be a contradiction to argue that the eu be both attempt to build up it military force as well a provide an alternative sense of security that do not rely on military power . 
point : while the new eu high representative for foreign and security policy mark only a bold first step towards a more unified voice for the eu , the decision be indeed still base on a state by state consultation mechanism hence the name representative . this should however not to be downplay a a less significant change in how the eu approach it foreign policy . the consultation aspect be in fact essential to reach agreement and the importance of not only present a united front to the rest of the world the eu be exemplary in trade policy and environmental policy , but less important when it come to present a united voice in foreign policy a belgian foreign minister mark eyskens put it in 1991 europe be an economic giant , a political dwarf , and a military worm 1 , but also create a united front through collaboration and debate . one should thus see this not only a a mean to an end , but rather a an important mechanism in itself , whereby new identity be slowly create along with a deep sense of commitment to a common set of value . 
counterpoint : consultation , collaboration and the attempted creation of a common set of value have not work and be not likely to work . this language be not much different from what we have hear with every attempt the eu have make to push for further political integration . the role of the common foreign and security policy cfsp , a agree upon back in 1993 during the maastricht treaty , be in fact present very much along similar line . fifteen year later however , that united front have not be create . if anything , the eu s political union , and certain any attempt towards a common foreign policy , have completely disintegrate when face with the war in iraq and the large war on terror and more recently the euro debt crisis on another front . 
point : the creation of a post of high representative and vice president of the commission hrvp mark an important change in the decision making process at the eu level with regard to foreign policy . agreement on the post show a clear commitment to the pursuit of a common eu foreign policy and to develop a unique cooperative model for foreign and defense policy decision making that go beyond the nation state . member state should now deliver on that commitment by seek as much common ground a possible to ensure that the high representative s role be truly significant . the goal of a common foreign and security policy should thus be support not only a a mechanism to streamline eu s position and role in world politics , but also to reinforce notion of cooperation and consultation essential for maintain a stable international system , in line with the stated goal of the eu . the 12 star in a circle be mean to symbolize the ideal of unity , solidarity and harmony among the people of europe 1 . 
counterpoint : the creation of a combined post of high representative for foreign and security policy and vice president of the commission for external relations mark a needless complication of decision making . it add an expensive and largely pointless layer of european bureaucracy to a substantively weak and poorly coordinate foreign policy . this failure be make worse by the member state refusal to appoint a senior european politician with international credential to the post . this suggest that the european union be simply not ready to pursue a serious and substantive foreign policy . 1 
point : the high representative will not only act a a spokesman for eu nation when they agree on foreign policy , but will act a a catalyst around which external policy will increasingly become coordinated . by chair meeting of eu foreign minister , he or she will be able to shape the agenda and influence the outcome of meeting , encourage member state increasingly to think in term of common foreign policy position . they will have add authority from their ability to speak for the eu in the un security council . the high representative will also direct the eu s new external action service , which bring together policy specialist from both the council and commission in a unique manner range from the arctic region to nuclear safety and enlargement 1 . with representative all over the world the eu will develop a foreign service capable of create and articulate policy position in a manner that few national government can match . over time this will promote the evolution of a true eu foreign and security policy , and will contribute significantly to increase european consciousness among eu citizen and further move to political unity . 
counterpoint : the position of high representative will be , and have be , largely powerless , because the member state have such divergent interest that agreement will be rare , and that attempt to devise a common foreign policy for the eu be doom . because control of foreign policy be such a key aspect of sovereignty , it would be wrong for national government to give this power away to the eu , which be less democratically accountable . if the eu and it high representative do try to pressure state into common position this may well backfire , create strong anti eu feeling in both national government and public opinion . pushing too hard for a common foreign policy and give too much power to an unelected high representative may instead begin to tear europe apart . 1
