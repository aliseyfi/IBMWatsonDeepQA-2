point : adversarial democratic system such a the united states , britain and australia have be become increasingly dysfunctional with politics simply be a shout match . coalition government lead to cooperation and compromise between parties1 . governments which be force to acknowledge a wide range of public opinion be less likely to introduce policy which victimise minority or ride roughshod over public opinion for ideological reason ; for example , the poll tax in the uk , 1988 92 . empirically , country with pr system , such a germany , show that great prosperity can result from the policy of such government . 
counterpoint : cooperation and compromise often do not happen and acknowledge a wide range of public opinion be the main reason why they cant compromise . firstly , they frequently won't agree , which will lead to tortuously slow progress or even to have no government for the country . this happen after the general election in belgium in 2010 , when the record be break for the time take to form a new democratic government after an election1 . this occur because none of the party be willing to compromise over election promise and yet do not want to have to fight another election . however if a government be to be form the party involve will have to make compromise and result in tear up some of their promise , betray those who vote for them . the alternative be the expense of go to the country again , with no guarantee of a different result2 . 
point : pr result in more engagement in politics a every vote counts1 . political participation be good and we should care about the low voter turnout in election that have be cause by first past the post . surveys show that that those who vote be more engaged in the community in other way and have good personal wellbeing . research in switzerland have show that voting do make people happy as well a be good inform citizen . the high the stake the person have , and the more likely their vote be to count the more effort they will make to find out the fact so a to make informed choice . 2 
counterpoint : there be no reason to assume that there will be an increase in political engagement . votes will simply not count in different way . if there be more coalition , people could feel their vote doesn't count even more strongly , a they will see that the party they vote for change their policy once in government . what be the point in vote for a platform if the party that be pledge to fulfil these promise be simply go to drop them as soon a the election be over and the negotiation begin ? 
point : first past the post fptp often result in a party without majority support be able to dominate parliament . minority party , such a the green party and ukip in the uk , which can win 5 10 or so of the vote all over the country , can fail to win a single seat . in the uk 2010 general election , ukip receive 919 , 546 vote across the country , but not a single seat1 . parties with a uniform vote across the country be punish unfairly . thus in singapore's general election of 2011 the national solidarity party contest 24 seat and win 39 . 25 of the valid vote across the ward it contest yet still fail to win any seat . 2 theoretically party could win huge number of vote , potentially up to 49 in every constituency , without ever get any representation in parliament . as such fptp favour party that appeal to local issue or to particular segment of the population these party that be lose out be likely to be those party that either appeal to a broad segment of the population or whose support be base upon an issue that affect everyone . furthermore , in the uk 2010 general election , two third of mps be elect without receive a majority of the vote in their constituency3 . this suggest that most people be be represent by people they didn't vote for . 
counterpoint : as there be many different form of proportional representation some of them will be fair than others . implementing av for example may help sort out the problem of mps not receive a majority in their constituency a they will now need to receive 50 of the vote in order to be elect . yet it will do nothing for the other two problem identify . minority party be still unlikely to get any seat and party with their vote uniformly spread across the country will still be punish . av in both case still favour geographically center party and still favor the top two party over any small one a the small party will drop out a the ballot be count . 
point : all political party have seat that they consider safe and unlikely to lose . if a person in an inner city constituency that have a strong labour history , wish to vote for someone other than labour , then their vote be effectively null and void . labour will win a majority however they vote . the fact that the seat be so safe mean that there be effectively very little effect people can have , result in thousand of people's vote be waste and have no effect when it come to form a government . in the 2010 uk general election the result be decide by less than 460 , 000 voter in only 111 constituency . this give an unfair amount of political influence to a tiny minority of the electorate while make the majority's vote close to worthless . 
counterpoint : if seat be safe , that be because people be continue to vote for a party that they be satisfied with . furthermore , it be perfectly possible for politician to lose safe seat if the electorate be no longer happy with them ; for example , in 2008 , the scottish national party snp win glasgow east , one of labour's safe seats1 .
