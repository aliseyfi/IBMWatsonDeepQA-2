point : spending so much time either performing or training limit the amount of formal education the child can receive . for example , in the uk and other country , child performer be only require to be educate for three hour each day . 1 
counterpoint : it be entirely possible for child performer to achieve high grade . for example , jodie foster graduate magna cum laude from yale university , despite have be a child star . 1 child performer who spend a lot of hour on set will also have access to a certify teacher who act a their personal tutor during that time . 2 
point : children be generally consider to be too young to make important decision for themselves , and so decision make fall to parent , teacher , etc . for child performer , there be additional decision maker : their agent . since agent benefit financially from the child s get a role or do well in a sporting event , there be a definite risk of exploitation . exploitation can also come from parent , a in the famous case of american television child star jackie coogan and gary coleman , who both sue their parent for spend the money they have earn a child 1 2 or of macaulay culkin , who block his parent from have access to his earnings . 
counterpoint : with the number of child performer on the increase , 1 parent be become more aware of what to expect from their child s agent , and thus less likely to unwittingly allow exploitation . additionally , law exist to prevent parent from spend their child s wage ; for example , the coogan law dictate that parent in california must open a trust account for their child in which 15 of that child s earnings must be put aside . 2 
point : even experience adult can find it difficult to deal with stage fright or performance anxiety . children , more emotionally vulnerable than adult by nature , should not be expose to this sort of pressure . this be especially true in situation where the child be be pay for their performance , since the added necessity to perform well can lead to even more pressure . although suicide among child be rare , it be believe often to occur a a result of the child feeling like she be under too much pressure , or fail to meet the expectation of others . 1 
counterpoint : children will always feel pressure in certain area of their life , whether with exam or school play . it may be true that pressure be great for child performer , but child who perform at a professional level be generally more skilled , and so they be often well at deal with this pressure . at the very least , they gain enough experience at a young age , that they learn the skill need to succeed , even in high pressure situation . given the pressure all child face , 1 surely it be ethical to allow child into a world where they can learn how to deal with these stress and protect themselves against possible future problem . 
point : children involve at a professional level in sport be at a high risk than their peer of physical problem like break bone . in some case , these physical problem can be fatal ; e . g . , julissa gomez , who die from complication of a vaulting injury contract when she be 15 in warm ups for a gymnastics competition . 1 
counterpoint : the added risk for most child athlete and performer be very low , and there be professional help in place for them to manage it . 
point : child performer be expose to a much high level of responsibility than their peer , without the maturity to deal with it . they may be expose to sex , drug , or alcohol , in a context too far remove from a normal life that they don t learn adequate cop mechanism . it be no surprise that many child performer burn out by the time they reach adulthood , often experience problem long before , a in the case of actress drew barrymore , who enter rehab at the age of 13 . 1 children should not be encourage to enter into these adult world of act , model , dance , etc . michael jackson attribute his obsession with child and childhood a a consequence of have miss out on a childhood himself . 
counterpoint : cases like drew barrymore s be rare , and many young performer have happy and successful career . all young people be likely to be expose to adult experience at some point in their childhood , and it should be leave to parent and teacher to educate child of the danger of alcohol , drug , etc . , no matter what activity the child take part in outside of school or the home . for many of the area that involve child performer , there be also law in place to ensure child be not expose to age inappropriate situation . for example , in north america and other country law exist to ensure child in the entertainment industry be not put at risk physically no dangerous stunt , expose to morally compromise situation , or ever allow to be nude or partially nude , or be engage in overt sexual act . 1 
point : child performer be currently protect by law about all sort of thing from the minimum amount of education they may get to their pay and how many hour they can work . many of these law would be much more difficult to enforce than a blanket ban . it would be simple to enforce a child performer would in most case be easy to spot a they be perform for the public . the government could then bring charge against those who be employ the child and fine them . 
counterpoint : banning child performer could be successful for professional child performer in regulated industry but it would be much more difficult to prevent child performer on a small scale . it will also be very difficult to get a balance between allow child to develop in their chosen profession or sport while prevent them from actually engage in any performance that display that talent .
