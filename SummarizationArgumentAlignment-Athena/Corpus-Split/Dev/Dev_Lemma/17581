point : religious symbol be see to , in some case , increase the equality divide between gender . as an example , the muslim hijab be consider by some a a very powerful symbol for the oppression of woman , particularly in country such a saudi arabia or afghanistan where it be compulsory . therefore , when it be wear in western country that encourage democracy and equality , the wearing of the hijab be see a almost counter productive to the goal of democratic society . for this reason belgium have recently ban the wearing of the full muslim veil , much like france in 2010 . 1 often muslim dress rule for woman be see a more severe than those for men . inequality between men and woman be a form of discrimination and liberal society should fight all form of discrimination . 
counterpoint : religious symbol be not see a oppressive by those who choose to wear them . many muslim woman view the veil a a mean to protect their modesty and privacy . just a we would not force any woman to be see in public in her underwear if she do not feel comfortable do so , why should a woman be force to show her hair if she do not want to ? modesty be a personal judgement call ; some be comfortable in the small bikini while others prefer a lot more clothing . no one but the woman herself should make that decision . in fact , concern the ban of the veil in belgium , muslim woman have immediately challenge it and regard the ban a discriminatory . 1 
point : as well a division in society in general , religious symbol be also a source of division within school environment . the hijab cause school many problem . it be potentially divisive in the classroom , mark some child out a different from the others and above the rule that the school enforces for everyone else . this may lead to alienation and bullying . full headscarf may also be impractical or dangerous in some lesson , for example pe , swimming , or in technology and science lesson where machinery be be operate . in the same way , there have be discussion a to whether to ban the display of crucifixes in public classroom . authorities in italy have follow through with the ban say that such a christian symbol segregate those who be not christian . 1 
counterpoint : intolerant school cause more problem for not allow freedom of religious expression . in a multicultural society , student should be aware of the different religious practice and cultural tradition of their classmate , and be teach to understand and respect these . without such respect , religious group with distinctive symbol , such a orthodox jews , sikhs and christians , will be drive out of mainstream education and force to educate their child separately . 1 as for the worry about safety issue , particularly concern hair length , most classroom accident occur when loose , long hair get catch in machinery or in a flame which would not be a problem when hair be hold in place under a headscarf . 
point : religious symbol can be see a possible tool for fuel division within society . when some woman wear the hijab it create pressure on other muslim woman to also cover their head . pressure come both socially from want to look like other woman in their community and religiously from imam and family leader press for observance . as such , muslims themselves be divide and religious oppression against woman be internalize . 1 approving of muslim head covering in society cement the hijab a an essential tenet of islam , in the mind of non muslims as well a believer . however , many different school of islam exist and a on other issue , they often disagree how to interpret the koran's dress prescription . moderate interpretation accept modest form of modern dress while severe interpretation require full covering with the burka or similar veil . banning the veil further the cause of moderate interpretation and prevent the entrenchment of severe interpretation . 
counterpoint : muslim woman be not the only one to feel a cultural division over their mode of dress . most people be affect by the societal norm surround them . fashion trend could be see in exactly the same light a religious tradition . banning head covering be only likely to provoke a more extreme reaction among highly religious communities1 . framing law to ban only islamic form of dress could be consider an attack on one religion . feeling under attack could cause the islamic community to close off into itself . they could set up religious school where their child can dress a they want them to and not mix with child from other faith . these effect could never be good for the integration of society and would further the influence of extremist . internationally , the perceived attack on islamic value would inflame wide muslim opinion , fee conspiracy theory and add to the dangerous feeling that there be a clash of civilisation . 
point : a ban would be simple to create and enforce . religious symbol be for the most part meant to be show therefore it be simple for police or authority to check that someone be not wear them . there be many society that have have ban on a religious symbol in public building , for example in france where there be a ban on religious symbol in school have be in force since 2004 . in france the ban be make even easy to enforce by restrict it to 'conspicuous' religious apparel . 1 moreover when the ban be only when enter public building it can be enforce by the teacher , or the building's security guard rather than be an issue for the police to deal with . 
counterpoint : deciding what people can and can t wear should not be the responsibility of school . enforcement may be potentially simple but only at the cost of create a conflict between school and their muslim pupil and staff . 
point : many society be found on secular value that do not permit the sponsorship of any religion by the state . british society aspire to this and have consciously act to separate religion from state authority with many organisation such a the national secular society encourage the suppression of any religious expression in public place . 1 in this climate it be important that all citizen of the state be see a equal . if some dress differently to others , deliberately identify themselves a member of one religion , this can harm the unity and ethos of the state . this hold particularly true for institution of the state like school and government office . in this way , it be possible to deduce that religious symbol be detrimental to the secular and equality focus identity of western society . 
counterpoint : even though the wearing of religious symbol could be a part of that specific religions' culture and practice , it must be remember that western society and culture brand itself a secular and , therefore , should take precedence over clash with minority cultural practice . in britain there have be controversy over movement to include sharia law in the british legal system , which tie in with this same argument of culture clash concern religious method . 1 essentially , the question arise a to how far be tolerance for different cultural practice detrimental for the maintenance of a secular british culture and state .
