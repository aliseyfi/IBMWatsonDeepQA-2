point : term limit be a necessary check on executive power to prevent an over mighty executive . whereas the legislature and judiciary be compose of many compete view , with member of various party and outlook represent , the executive of a country speak with a single voice . in legislature , party leader be not the sole source of power , with faction and alternative nexus of influence form throughout that branch of government . 1 executive power , on the other hand , rest solely in the hand of the leader , usually a president . the leader have full power over the policy of the executive branch of government . cabinets , which form part of the executive in practice , be usually directly answerable to the leader , and minister can be dismiss if they be uncooperative or dispute the leader s policy . even in parliamentary system , leader with a majority and a strong party whip can command the same power a a strong president , if not more . it be thus necessary to have a check on the highly individual power that be the executive . term limit be the best such check . term limit allow leader to enact their policy over a set time period and then usher them out of office . 2 this be essential , because too much power in the hand of a single individual for too long can upset the balance of power in a country and shift power in favour of the executive , thus damage the protection to society that check provide . this be exactly what happen in the united kingdom under tony blair where from the start cabinet government virtually disappear former cabinet secretary lord butler say in the eight month i be cabinet secretary when tony blair be prime minister , the only decision the cabinet take be about the millennium dome , 3 and power continue to be ever more centralized in response to terrorism . 
counterpoint : leaders may have a single view and be the sole centre of power in the executive branch , but that do not mean the leader s remain in office will somehow shift power away from the other branch . the separation of power be constitutionally protect in most country , and leader power will be circumscribe by these whether term limit or not . in the example of tony blair and gordon brown while blair be centralize power in number 10 brown at the treasury always have an independent voice and enough power to prevent the prime minister get his way on domestic policy . 
point : power have a strong tendency to corrupt ; it be highly intoxicating . for this reason , it should not be leave in the hand of one person for too long . when a leader be firmly entrench , he may seek to enrich himself at the expense of the public . he may seek to shower benefice on family and ally in order to maintain and strengthen his powerful position . without term limit the executive run the risk of become a personal fief , rather than the office of first servant of the people , a it should be . this be see particularly in part of the developing world where leader use state fund to generate electoral support from key group and to maintain the loyalty of essential supporter . a current example of this be in venezuela where hugo chavez have be able to monopolize power to the point where it be unclear who his successor would be should he die suddenly . 1 term limit serve to limit the ability of individual to enact self aggrandize policy and to retain power indefinitely . 2 instead , by maintain term limit , leader have only a limited time in power , which tend to shift their focus toward genuinely benefit the public . 
counterpoint : people be not stupid . they will not vote for someone who be use the power of the executive to enrich himself . rather , leader will only be able to stay in power so long a they do what the people want . if leader be maintain their power by other mean , such a institutionalized corruption and force , it be not because there be no term limit on the leader , but rather because of other fundamental problem of government in those state , in such case a with chavez the executive will have enough power simply to override the imposed term limit . 1 
point : incumbency provide a huge election advantage . leaders and politician generally , almost always win re election . such have be the case in the united states , for example , where president be almost always re elect for a second term . leaders be re elect because they have good name recognition both with the electorate and with lobby group . people have a tendency to vote for those who they recognize , and firm tend to support past winner who will likely continue to benefit their interest . this problem have become particularly serious in develop world in which revolutionary leader from the original independence movement be still politically active . these leader often command huge following and mass loyalty , which they use to maintain power in spite of poor decision and corruption in many case . such have be the case in zimbabwe with robert mugabe win presidential election in spite of mass corruption and mismanagement . 1 only recently have the people finally vote against him , but it be too late , a his power have become too entrenched to unseat him . the uphill battle that will always exist to unseat incumbent make term limit necessary . countries need new idea and new leader to enact them . old leader use election machine to retain power do their country a disservice . power be best use when it change hand over time in order allow for dynamic new solution to be moot in a changing world . 
counterpoint : voters will choose the leader they think will do the best job , if this be the incumbent then that be democracy . election machine and lobby group may be able to help an incumbent somewhat , but at the end of the day the leader must be able to convince the people that he have do a good job and be still suitable to lead . as to the issue of country like zimbabwe , if the people want to keep elect a revolutionary hero , that be their choice . the overruling of election result , a occur in the most recent zimbabwean election , however , be not democratic and thus unacceptable for a mature state . mugabe s ability to flaunt the will of the people be not due to a lack of term limit , however , but on an inadequate separation of power inherent in the system . 1 adding term limit to that system , and indeed any system , will do little to redress imbalance between branch of government . the case of vladimir putin be similarly instructive , despite step down after his second term , he thereafter take the office of prime minister and maintain effective power . term limit be no barrier to those determine and popular enough to hang on to power . 
point : a focus of a leader who be look toward the next election be on get vote . it be often the case that hard decision need to be make by leader , but it be difficult for them to do so when they be concern with be re elect . a leader have an incentive to put tough decision off if he can retain power by do so . when constrain by term limit , leader must make the most of their limited time in office , result in great prioritization of difficult decision and reform . 1 furthermore , the need to constantly fight election place leader in the pocket of lobby group and election supporter to a great degree , a they will always need to go back to them for support , and thus cannot make decision that be in the national interest alone . while there will always be some of this behaviour , it be curtail by term limit , a leader in their final term will not be behold to a many special interest a they cannot run again . 
counterpoint : a leader who be term limited suffers from the effect of be a lame duck . a final term leader will not be able to command the same degree of leverage a one who can potentially serve another term . furthermore , a to lobby group support , a leader on the way out who cannot seek another term have an incentive to favour group and firm that will place him on their board , a potentially highly lucrative retirement package for leader , pay for often at the expense of the public .
