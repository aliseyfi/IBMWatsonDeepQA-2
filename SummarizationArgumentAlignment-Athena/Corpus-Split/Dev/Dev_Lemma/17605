point : poaching have be effectively eliminate in part of southern africa through efficient game park management and the development of game tourism , which give local people an incentive to protect wildlife a a long term economic resource . in kenya , tourism be the third large contributor to their economy , and 70 of this be derive from wildlife , but it be still not enough1 . the director of the association in kenya charge with elephant protection , the lusaka agreement taskforce , have admit mobilize adequate resource to combat the illegal wildlife trade be a challenge2 . for this approach to be sustain the park must generate great income ; realistically , this can only be do through the sale of stockpiled ivory . why should they not be able to profit from stockpiled ivory confiscate from poacher or dead elephant ? 
counterpoint : permitting the sale of stockpiled ivory only provide an incentive to clamp down on poacher once they have complete their poaching . as a result , little weight be give to the welfare of the elephant . states hop to profit from the sale of stockpile be in essence be encourage to work in cohort with poacher ; poacher get the ivory , they then get 'caught' by the state who give them a cut of subsequent sale of the 'confiscated' ivory . an entire black market could evolve whereby both the state and poacher profit , with the elephant population the only loser . 
point : ivory be expensive to store , and degrade over time . it cost zimbabwe 13 million annually to secure it stockpile1 . the wildlife authority in the country be now keen for the moratorium on the international sale of ivory to end in 2016 so that they can benefit from the stockpiling and recoup the cost of storage1 . zimbabwe be also believe to be close to the limit of it storage space1 . it be therefore sensible to allow it sale in order to recoup these expense and to do so on a permanent , controlled basis , rather than through one off scheme such a the 1999 sale to japan . 
counterpoint : storage cost and depreciation be only problem if ivory be store in the hope of eventual sale . kenya's game conservancy burn the ivory it obtain from cull or confiscates from poacher , avoid both of these problem and show it commitment to end all possibility of renew trade1 . if zimbabwe be truly commit to the long term viability of it elephant population , it would do similarly and burn it large , exist stockpile . kenya have also advance plan to send all confiscated ivory to a museum where the item can be display and income generate in a sustainable fashion2 . both solution remove the cost incur in stockpile confiscated ivory . 
point : the elephant population of southern african state be grow rapidly , place a strain upon the resource of the national park in which they live . this have necessitate cull with the result that government environment agency have build up large stockpile of ivory also acquire from animal that die naturally , which they be currently unable to sell . relaxing the cites ban on trading ivory , subject to careful regulation , would bring much need cash to the environmental programme of these impoverished country , help them to safeguard the long term survival of african elephant . the relaxation of the cites ban in the late '90s be worth 5 million for bostwana , namibia and zimbabwe ; a regular income , such a figure would be invaluable for a struggle central african economy . 
counterpoint : although elephant population in southern africa be viable and increase , this be not the case elsewhere in africa , nor be it true of the wild asian elephant population of south asia . the world wildlife fund wwf report that 'while some population of elephant in southern or eastern africa be stable or recover , forest elephant in central africa be in grave danger from poach , fuel by demand for illegal ivory'1 . in many of these area , it be not a problem of large population of elephant strain resource , but reduction in rainfall and warfare endanger already small group of elephants2 . lifting the ban would only encourage the use of these endanger animal and their prized ivory for short term income . 
point : states that posse elephant population that be currently grow would be eligible , under the new model , to sell their stockpiled ivory . there would be no limit on the amount of ivory sell , provide that the growth rate of the population remain positive . therefore , the confiscated ivory from poacher and small scale cull would be eligible to be sell on the international market . all sale would have to go through the environmental agency of the states' concern . 
counterpoint : any model that lift the absolute ban on the ivory trade will lead to unnecessary and extensive culling . dna evidence from the most recent lifting of the ban in 2008 find that 'some tusk originate from african country not take part in the cites sale suggest that the commodity be be ship across border before be export into asia 1 . therefore , the intent of the propose model to differentiate between those country with sustainable population and those without be short sight at best . legalizing even a restricted ivory trade will make all elephant , however endanger their local population , target for poacher and government alike . 
point : a trading ban do not choke off demand for the ivory , but instead raise the price to exorbitant level , encourage poaching . demand since 1989 have be depress by japan's economic problem , from which it be now emerge , while in china ivory be associate with prosperity and be a status symbol ; a the number of wealthy chinese increase , so too be the demand and price of ivory . poachers be only go to be far encourage to disregard the trading ban , whatever the costs1 . legitimate , regulate sale would undercut the illegal market and drive the poacher out of business , ensure elephant population be protect and remain stable . 
counterpoint : the trading ban be the best option available to restrict the ivory trade and protect elephant population . it will never be able to stop all trade in ivory , particularly because many of the african state from which the ivory be sell lack government with a monopoly on force and uncorrupted official . nevertheless , the ban be more effective than it alternative .
