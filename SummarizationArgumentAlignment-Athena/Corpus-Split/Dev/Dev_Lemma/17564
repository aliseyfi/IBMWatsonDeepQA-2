point : criminals will do anything if it mean they be well off a a result , include lie under oath . firstly , a convict these people have already prove themselves to have a faulty moral character . secondly , defendant have an incentive to shift blame to reduce their own culpability . by incriminate another member of their group , informant be able to tell a story that be favourable to them , lessen their own moral culpability and reduce the cost they have to pay for commit a crime . in order to secure these benefit , cooperate witness have every incentive to fabricate evidence . james w . haldin write : an offer of prosecutorial leniency enhance the natural tendency of an accomplice to lie by provide an incentive to offer testimony that be favorable to the prosecution . the witness must satisfy the prosecutor in order to obtain the benefit of his bargain 1 . moreover , it be almost impossible to verify whether or not their information be accurate . not only do accomplice witness have a motive to fabricate , they often have an ability to fabricate and to fabricate convincingly . they can manipulate their version of event without arouse much suspicion a they know all the detail of the crime and which aspect of the enterprise be verifiable so where they can risk lie 2 . 
counterpoint : criminals have just as much chance of incriminate themselves with false testimony , which act a a deterrent against provide faulty information . accomplices be unaware of what other evidence there may be in the case , which may contradict false story . this mean that a n accomplice who be unaware of the other evidence or the lack thereof have a selfish reason not to fabricate testimony . if the accomplice make thing up , his testimony could conflict with other evidence , and the trial judge , who usually will determine the accomplice's sentence , will see that he be a liar and treat him accordingly . those argument have prove effective , and defendant have be convict of murder in federal court when the only evidence of their participation in the crime be the assertion of an accomplice 1 . moreover , accomplice have an incentive to tell the truth and nothing but the truth since they be swear in under oath and lie under oath constitutes perjury which be punishable by a prison sentence . this would nullify any benefit to give the testimony , a instead of receive a less harsh sentence they would receive a harsher one , therefore provide a strong incentive to tell the truth . 
point : testimony base plea bargaining force the defendant to make an agreement with the government which can be break by the prosecutorial team at any time , leave no check to ensure that basic right be protect . pamela metzger argue the government be to be the sole judge of whether the defendant have truthfully and completely cooperate . the decision a to whether the cooperation rise to the level of substantial assistance will be leave to the sole discretion of the prosecutor's office . often a cooperation agreement do not specify the extent of the departure the government will request . and , even if it do , that request would not be bind upon the sentence court . finally , if the defendant fail to perform under the term of the agreement , the prosecutor's office retain the right to use the defendant's statement against him at a subsequent prosecution for false statement 1 . defendants that enter into plea agreement assume a massive risk insofar a their testimony can be deem insubstantial at any point of time and then use to convict them in a late trial . 
counterpoint : if an agent consent to certain treatment , that treatment be justified . desert stem from the choice we make rather than external factor , so consent be a sufficient condition for the justness of an action . since plea bargaining by definition involve an agreement from both side , plea bargaining in exchange for testimony be just because both party consent to it . individuals involve in plea deal make informed decision . there be safeguard include legal representation at every stage , even before a plea be register , and guidance on sentence to help to ensure that defendant make an informed and voluntary decision . judges also have to ensure that the defendant be aware that a guilty plea will mean that he forfeit his right to a trial and that he know the full range of penalty he face upon conviction1 . 
point : most case involve plea bargaining for testimony be crime of collusion ; that be , prosecutor most often strike deal with member of organize crime group in order to pin down the leader . as such , informant have incentive to lie in order to either improve their own standing in organize crime s hierarchical structure or to weed out competition . r . michael cassidy confirms : because the government frequently pursue cooperation by low echelon criminal against the high ups in an organization , some witness may view cooperation with the government in a criminal case a a mean to reorder a previously hierarchical relationship . the informant may be manipulate the system for personal or pecuniary gain , such a a desire to take over the joint criminal enterprise for himself or an ally after help to put the confederate away 1 . even if the plea bargain give accurate information the government should not be help low rank member pursue their own ambition by use the state . 
counterpoint : testimony in organize crime trial can easily be verify . the law enforcement agency simply have to be thorough in check testimony . even if the testimony be uncorroborated when it come to the particular act the testimony should provide detailed context to allow the jury to determine how credible it be . the testimony be also unlikely to be stand on it own so there will be other area of the testimony which can be corroborate by other evidence . for example the rule of the organization could help establish if the witness be in a position to know about the criminal act . 1 
point : the practice of plea bargaining for testimony assumes that the level of culpability within a group be totally different . in other word , it assume that some individual have negligible level of culpability and so can be bargain with while others be fully responsible and so deserve to be prosecute to the full extent . but , this division be false because it ignore the collective nature of crime of collusion . solidarity in the mob and decision making procedure in a corporation both change individual intention by create a group base context for one s intention that be radically different from the context of personal experience outside of the group . as a result the action cannot be fully explain by reference to the intention of individual , isolated people . it therefore make sense to talk , in a limited way , about the collective intent of social group . 1 so , allow testimony base plea bargain disproportionately lays blame in the hand of the ringleader of the organize crime group . subordinates , by contrast , become witness for instead of enemy of the state and get off with extremely light sentence . however , just because individual be in an authority position do not mean that they be the most responsible for that crime . morally , there be no distinction between come up with a crime and carry it out . in fact , subordinate be often more dangerous because they have show that they be willing to carry out heinous crime . therefore , give subordinate more lenient sentencing disregard the collective nature of the crime and so de link culpability and punishment . 
counterpoint : firstly , use testimony from accomplice help catch other guilty criminal and allow the state to administer retributive punishment on them . this be more important because with plea bargaining there be proportional punishment for one criminal and low punishment for another , whereas without it there be only proportional punishment for one criminal and no punishment for another . obviously , some punishment for crime be good than no punishment , even if it isn't proportionally retributive . second , plea bargaining for testimony ensures that the guilty be catch and not the innocent . without it , the state run a great risk of convict innocent . convicting innocent create a massive retributive gap since innocent by definition do not do anything warrant punishment and thus be due no retribution . third , reduce sentence for those member who follow order to do the organization's dirty work be justified . henchman of the organization merely follow order and be thus not fully responsible for the action they take due to their diminished decision making , and this low level of responsibility should be reflect in sentence .
