point : workfares offer the unemployed opportunity to develop skill to work their way out of poverty . productive work raise the expectation of those involve by increase their self respect and provide them with more confidence in their ability . it also develop skill associate with work , such a time keep , take and give instruction , work in a team , accept responsibility and prioritising . such skill may seem mundane but they be very valuable to employer and their absence among the long term unemployed be a key reason why they find it so hard to gain job . individuals who be currently work be also more attractive to potential employer than those who be unemployed , especially the long term unemployed . the evidence suggest workfare be a success ; study of workfare in maryland find that 75 per cent of those who leave welfare have earnings within 2 . 5 years1 . 1 : kaus , m . 2000 , april 16 . now she's done it . retrieved july 19 , 2011 , from slate 2 
counterpoint : workfare scheme be of little use if there be no job out there for people to do something which be an issue of wide economic management . often the skill which employer be really demand be literacy , numeracy and familiarity with modern information technology , which menial make work task be unlikely to provide the unemployed with . far good to invest in proper education and train scheme instead . even if such skill might be develop through workfare scheme , will force people into such work really mean they get the benefit ? most of the long term unemployed be old , make redundant from decline industry ; they do not lack skill but suffer instead from ageist prejudice among employer . finally , if the workfare job that unemployed people be be force into be real job that need do , then they should simply be employ to do them in the normal way either by the state or by private company 
point : making the unemployed work for their welfare benefit call the bluff of those claiming benefit but not really look for job . such scrounger include the incurably lazy , those who be defraud the taxpayer by claim welfare while hold down a pay job , and those who be work in the black economy . furthermore , workfare scheme require applicant also search for work whilst complete the scheme1 . moving from a traditional something for nothing welfare scheme to a workfare system stop all these individual from be a burden on the state , cut welfare roll very rapidly and allow the government to concentrate upon assist the truly needy . 
counterpoint : the number of people defraud the system be very small only 0 . 007 of the total cost of the benefit system . the majority of people on benefit be seek work . they will be hinder in so do , because instead of apply for work , attend interview and develop relevant skill they will be force to attend their workfare scheme . thus , people will remain on benefit for long , cost the government more in the long term . 
point : society also benefit from the work do by those on workfare scheme : these might include environmental improvement in local community , service to assist the elderly and disabled , and work for charity or local authority . in many case the labour they provide would not have be available in any other way , so the addition they make to everyone's quality of life be a welcome bonus to the scheme . furthermore , a 2011 study in denmark find a 'strong and significant crime reduce effect of the workfare policy . '1 
counterpoint : workfares have low standard that produce poor and potentially unsafe product . individuals force into workfare scheme lack incentive to work to a high standard , and may be actively disaffect . the work they do be therefore unlikely to benefit anyone much and raise a number of safety issue : would you drive across a bridge build by workfare labour ? would you trust your aged parent or pre school child to a workfare carer ? would you trust them with any job that require the handling of money ? given these constraint , it be clear that the government may be unable to find enough worthwhile thing for their forced labourer to do . 
point : making the unemployed work for their welfare money positively break the dependency culture . receiving unemployment benefit for do nothing make individual too reliant on the state and encourages apathy and laziness ; this be particularly true of the long term unemployed and of those who have never have a pay job since leave school . as president clinton say regard welfare reform , 'the goal be to break the culture of poverty and dependence' . tying welfare money to productive work challenge these something for nothing assumption and show that the state have a right to ask for something in return for the generosity of it taxpayer . in new york , workfare pay slightly less than the minimum wage , preserve the incentive for the unemployed to use workfare a a step stone into a good paid , long term job1 . 
counterpoint : workfare do not break the dependency culture . people do not seek unemployment and dependency on the state . no one voluntarily seek to live on the very low income provide by state benefit , instead people become unemployed through no fault of their own ; workfare stigmatise them a lazy and needing to be force into work by state coercion . the scheme ignore the talent and ambition of those involve , typically use them for menial task and manual labour that teach them no useful skill
