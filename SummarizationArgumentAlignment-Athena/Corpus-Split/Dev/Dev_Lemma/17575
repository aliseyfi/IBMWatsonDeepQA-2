point : the current drug patent regime be largely design to benefit and shield the profit of large pharmaceutical company . this be due to the fact that most of the law on drug patent be write by lobbyist and vote upon by politician in the pay of those firm . the pharmaceutical industry be simply massive and have one of the most powerful lobby in most democratic state , particularly the united states . the law be orchestrate to contain special loophole , which these firm can exploit in order to maximize profit at the expense of the taxpayer and of justice . for example , through a process call evergreening , drug firm essentially re patent drug when they near expiration by patent certain compound or variation of the drug1 . this can extend the life of some patent indefinitely ensure firm can milk customer at monopoly price long after any possible cost of research or discovery be recoup . a harm that arise from this be the enervate effect that patent can generate in firm . when the incentive be to simply rest on one's patent , wait for them to expire before do anything else , societal progress be slow . in the absence of such patent , firm be necessarily force to keep innovating to stay ahead , to keep look for profitable product and idea . the free flow of idea generate by the abolition of drug patent will invigorate economic dynamism . 
counterpoint : there be nothing unjust about the patent system . it protect everyone equally . the nature of democracy be such that people be allow to express their opinion and to organize to further certain aim . drug company have a particular interest in protect their patent right so it be only natural that they should involve themselves in the process of how those patent should be treat legally . they be not miscreant , but rather be participant in a system that be design to be as fair a possible for everyone . 
point : many develop country be fraught with terrible disease . much of africa and asia be devastate by malaria , and in many part of africa aids be a horrendous scourge , infect large percentage of many country population . for example , in swaziland , 26 of the adult population be infect with the virus1 . in light of these obscenely high infection rate , african government have seek to find mean of acquire enough drug to treat their ailing population . the producer of the major aids medication do donate substantial amount of drug to stricken country , yet at the same time they charge ruinously high price for that which they do sell , lead to serious shortage in country that cannot afford them . the denial of the right to produce or acquire generic drug be effectively a death sentence to people in these country . with generic drug freely available on the market , the access to such drug would be facilitate far more readily and cheaply ; price would be push down to market level and african government would be able to stand a chance of provide the requisite care to their people2 . under the current system attempt by government to access generic drug can be meet by denial of free treatment , lead to even far suffering . there be no ethical justification to allow pharmaceutical company to charge artificially high price for drug that save life . furthermore , many firm that develop and patent drug do not share them , nor do they act upon them themselves due to their unprofitability . this have be the case with various treatment for malaria , which affect the developing world almost exclusively , thus limit the market to customer with little money to pay for the drugs3 . the result be patent and viable treatment sit on shelf , effectively gather dust within company record , when they could be use to save life . but when there be no profit there be no production . allowing the production of generic drug be to allow justice to be do in the developing world , save life and end human suffering . 
counterpoint : allowing the sale of generic drug will not help the plight of the developing world . many drug company invest substantial amount of money , glean from the sale of profitable dug in the developed world , into research treatment for the developing world . without the revenue available from patent protect drug sale , companies' profit will fall , precipitate a reduction in pro bono give and research . allowing the production of generic drug will thus in the long run hurt the developing world . 
point : the sale of generic drug invariably reduce cost to consumer . this be due to two reason . it may be the case that an individual or firm with a patent , essentially a monopoly right to the production of something , may not have the ability to efficiently go about meet demand for it . patents slow , or even stop the dissemination of the production method , especially when a patent holder be unwilling to license production to others1 . such an outcome be deleterious to society , a with no restriction on drug production an efficient producer , or producer , will emerge to meet the need of the public , produce an amount of drug commensurate with demand , and thus equilibrate market price with that demand2 . this market equilibration be impossible under conventional patent law , a it be in the interest of firm to withhold production and to engage in monopolist rent seek from consumers3 . this lead firm to deliberately under produce , which they have be show to do in many case , a for example the case of miacalcic , a drug use to treat paget's disease , in which it producer deliberately keep production down in order to keep price high4 . when a firm be give monopoly power over a drug it have the ability to abuse it , and history show that be what they be wont to do . by allow the production of generic drug , this monopoly power be break and people can get the drug they need at cost that be not mark far above their free market value . 
counterpoint : allowing the production of generic drug will only increase production of drug currently on the market . without the profit incentive that patent provide , pharmaceutical company will not invest in the expensive process of develop new drug in the first place . it be a necessary trade off , a patent be essential to incentivize innovation . furthermore , many state have mandatory licensing law in state require company to license the right to the production of drug so a not to precipitate shortage . 
point : patent regime cause firm to inefficiently allocate resource . one such inefficiency arises from the duplication of effort by firm seek to develop the same or very similar drug , though only the first to do so may profit from it due to the winner take all patent system . this lead to brutal race and excessive expenditure of resource to be first over the line and to monopolize the production , at least for a time . these race can thus lead to effort by firm to steal research from one another , thus result in further waste of resource in engage and attempt to prevent corporate espionage . another serious inefficiency arises in the production of similar product to exist one , seek to get around exist patent . such have be the case for year in the pharmaceutical industry , which have succeed , for example , in cure erectile dysfunction dozen of time . an overemphasis on such spin off of similar product be the result of patent generate inefficiency 1 . the inefficiency do not end with production , however , a firm likewise devote great amount of resource and effort to the development of non duplicable product , in monitoring for infringement , and in prosecute offender , all of which generate huge cost and little or no return 2 . furthermore , the deterrent effect to patent piracy generate by all the effort of the state and firm have prove generally minimal . clearly , in the absence of patent protection for pharmaceutical , market and firm will behave more efficiently . this be show by the introduction of generic antiretroviral drug for treat aids where the introduction of generic drug force the price of the branded drug down from 10439 to 931 in september october 2000 3 . 
counterpoint : the cost associate with the current patent regime be necessary to the maintenance of innovation . it may be costly , and technically inefficient to police property right , but that do not make them less of a right . if firm feel they can benefit from fight infringers of their patent right , it be their right to do so . the state likewise , have an obligation to protect the right , physical and intangible , of it citizen and cannot give up on them simply because they prove difficult and costly to enforce . 
point : an individual's idea , so long a it rest solely in his mind or be keep safely hidden , belongs to him . when he disseminate it to everyone and make it public , it become part of the public domain , and belongs to anyone who can use it . if individual or firm want to keep something a secret , like a production method , then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product . one should not , however , expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one have , since no such ownership right exists1 . no one can own an idea . thus recognize something like a property right over something like a drug formula be contrary to reason , since do so give monopoly power to individual who may not make efficient or equitable use of their asset . physical property be a tangible asset , and thus can be protect by tangible safeguard . ideas do not share this right to protection , because an idea , once speak , enter the public domain and belongs to everyone . this should apply all the more with vital drug that be fundamentally for the public good by improve health . 
counterpoint : ideas can be own , to a certain extent . the creative effort involve in the production of a drug formula be every bit as great a the building of a new chair or other tangible asset . nothing special separate them and law must reflect that . it be a fundamental violation of property right to steal from drug company the right they own to drug by allow the production of generic knock offs .
