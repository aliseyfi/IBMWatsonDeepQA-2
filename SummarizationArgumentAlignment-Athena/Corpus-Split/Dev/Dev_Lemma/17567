point : the reliance of america and it western ally on conventional fossil fuel , chiefly oil , be a major security issue . currently the united states must buy most of it oil from authoritarian and often hostile state such a saudi arabia , venezuela and iran , or from unstable place like nigeria . 22 of us oil come from the middle east , 22 from africa , and 19 from latin america1 . the past action of opec and the recent willingness of russia to use it supply of natural gas to threaten european state both point to a need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels2 . oil price often rise due to instability in the region where it be produce , which have harmful impact for consumer around the world . for example , in 2011 the invasion in libya cause oil price to rise because of fear of reduced oil production in the region the us and it ally lose leverage over many international actor a it hand be tie due to dependence on oil , a be the case with nuclear proliferation in iran for example . the us department of agriculture determine that the us could produce enough biomass to meet 30 of it energy need , which in addition to other form of alternative energy could make a significant impact on oil consumption . increasing the use of biofuels can therefore contribute to our security by ensure that more of our energy need be meet from within our own country , reduce our dependence on foreign supplier . 
counterpoint : attempting complete independence from other country be impossible and undesirable the world be now too interconnected and interdependent . prosperity rest upon be able to trade good and service widely with people in other country and attempt to retreat from this free market will impoverish u as well a them . nor be the usa and it western ally scarily dependent upon just one source for their fossil fuel need new country like angola and canada have all become major energy supplier in the past decade 1 . in any case , america s demand for energy be so great that there be no possibility of achieve energy independence through biofuels . f all of america s corn be use to produce ethanol , it would still only meet 4 of energy demand 2 . 
point : at present mankind be use up fossil fuel resource at an alarm rate , and often damage the environment in order to extract them . if we go on rely on fossil fuel they will one day run out , and not only will our descendant no longer have viable energy reserve , but they will also have to cope with the ecological damage coal , oil and gas extraction have inflict on the earth . making fuel from crop provide a perfect , sustainable solution . additionally , biofuels can be mixed with fossil fuel , and eventually replace them , without have to entirely change the infrastructure of country . other form of alternative energy would call for new investment and development just to use them , whereas biofuels can slowly be introduce to car in high quantity , and gradually new car will be design to run entirely on biofuels . however , overturn the entire system would not be necessary , reduce the cost associate with use biofuels . biofuels already have a great deal to offer today , but prospect for the future be even more exciting and deserve our support . new crop like jatropha promise to produce much more energy from a give amount of land1 . they also flourish without annual replanting or chemical input on marginal land . in the long term , bio engineer be work on produce cellulosic biofuels biofuels in which the stem and leaf of plant or tree be use to produce ethanol , not just the fruit or seed . cellulosic biofuels would allow much more fuel to be produce from a give amount of land , and could also be make from the waste product of food or timber production , such a straw and woodchip 1 . the future prospect for ethanol be great , and thus call for increased investment and development because only then will ethanol truly be a viable alternative . 
counterpoint : for biofuels to be renewable and sustainable , they will have to be grow in mass quantity . rainforests and grass land , which naturally soak up carbon , will need to be cut down , ultimately make ethanol that much more environmentally irresponsible . while they may be renewable , the quantity that would have to be grow make it an unreasonable solution . 
point : the growth of biofuels will be good for farmer , both in the west and in the developed world . in the 1990s and early 2000s farmer in the developed world have produce more food than the market require , result in large surplus and very low price . a great many farmer be drive out of business a a result , and few young people wish to try to make a living from the land . meanwhile , surplus grain from america and the eu have often be dump on market in the developing world , harm local farmer who be unable to compete1 . both sort of farmer stand to benefit from increased demand for biofuels , a farm income improve and market distorting surplus disappear . taxpayers may also benefit a there will be less need to subsidize more prosperous farmer . additionally , a more ethanol be produce , and consumption be incentivized , the price will drop . oil price tend to fluctuate which can often have devastate impact on the economy . mixing ethanol with crude can contribute to overall decrease the price of gasoline2 . with more energy come from ethanol , high oil price and instability around the world will have a weaken impact on economy . 
counterpoint : biofuels will not guarantee a glorious future for farmer , either in the west or in the developing world . oil price have swing very widely over the past twenty year , and may well collapse again in the future , especially a investment in new production have be encourage by recent high price and so more oil be likely to come on stream in the next few year . if oil price sink back even to the historically high level of 50 a barrel , then biofuels will look much less economic and farmer will go bust a a result . and agriculture in the developing world be hold back by the web of tariff and subsidy the rich world use to support it own farmer , not by market failure1 . truly free the market in commodity such a cotton , grain and sugar would do much more to bring prosperity to many desperately poor country than any promise biofuels may seem to offer . after all , if the usa or the eu really want to promote biofuels they would reduce their high tariff on import of cheap brazilian sugar cane ethanol rather than pay their own farmer to produce biofuel from much less efficient maize or rapeseed2 . 
point : biofuels be the best way of reduce our emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas responsible for global climate change . as with fossil fuel , burn biodiesel or ethanol to drive an engine or generate electricity release carbon into the atmosphere . unlike with fossil fuel , however , grow the plant from which biofuels be make take carbon from the air , so overall the process be carbon neutral1 . this mean policy to increase the use of biofuels could greatly reduce overall level of carbon emission , and so be a major part of tackle global climate change . since the international community have make reduce climate change a priority , with different climate conference like copenhagen , seek energy alternative should be at the forefront of their effort . biofuels can also help improve local air quality a mix ethanol with fossil fuel help meet clean air standard , and overall be one of the tool use to reduce carbon emission into the atmosphere . 
counterpoint : the idea that ethanol be carbon neutral be overlook the carbon emission associate with grow the crop energy for the machine as well a transport them to and from the processing facility . ethanol production consumes 6 unit of energy to produce 11 . in no world be that efficient or good for the environment .
