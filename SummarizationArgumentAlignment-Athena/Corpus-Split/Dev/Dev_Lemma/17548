point : reality tv be actually get bad a the audience become more and more used to the genre . in a search for rating and medium coverage , show be become ever more vulgar and offensive , try to find new way to shock . when the british big brother be struggle for viewer in 2003 , it producer respond by attempt to shock the audience that little bit more1 . big brother programme have also show men and woman have sex on live tv in a desperate grab high rating to justify their continued existence . others have involve fight and racist bullying . do we let thing continue until someone have to die on tv to boost the rating ? 
counterpoint : reality show be not become more corrupt or more filthy . what have change be rather what the public defines a acceptable viewing . in other word , the gap between what be actually real and what be present a reality be close thanks to modern reality program . and the gap be close due to popular demand to see reality on their tv screen . for example , the sex show on scandinavian episode of big brother be not shock or unrealistic , it be only unusual in the context of what we expect to see on television . the fact it be show only illustrate that the gap between what be actually real and what be present a reality on television be close . if the proposition have an issue therefore with what modern reality show be present , they have an issue with society at large , not reality program . even if be the case that reality programme be get more corrupt and filthy , viewer should take the advice of former u . s . president bush jr . and 'put the off button on . ' 
point : reality show send a bad message and help to create a cult of instant celebrity . they be typically build about shameless self promotion , base on humiliate others and harm relationship for the entertainment of each other and the viewer at home . these programme suggest that anyone can become famous just by get on tv and be themselves , without work hard or have any particular talent . kids who watch these show will get the idea that they don't need to study hard in school , or train hard for a regular job . as john humphrys point out , 'we tell kid what matter be be a celebrity and we wonder why some behave the way they do' 1 as american lawyer lisa bloom fear , 'addiction to celebrity culture be create a generation of dumbed down woman . '2 reality show encourage such addiction and promote the generally misguided belief that they should aspire to be the reality star they watch on their television . 1 humphrys , j . 2004 , august 28 . take this oath : first , do no harm . retrieved july 4 , 2011 , from the guardian : 3 2 becker , a . 2003 , march 1 . hot or not : reality tv can be harmful to woman . retrieved july 4 , 2011 , from pyschology today 5 
counterpoint : reality tv do not discourage hard work or education , rather it create a society whereby we have share experience and a strong sense of community . as such , reality tv provide an important social glue . once upon a time there be only a few television channel , and everybody watch the same few programme . the sense of a shared experience help to bind people together , give them common thing to talk about at work and school the next day water cooler moment . reality program like survivor play that role in contemporary society with viewership be almost a cultural imperative , the experience share simultaneously with friend and family . 1 
point : reality show be bad , lazy and corrupt television . they mostly show ordinary people with no special talent do very little . if they have to sing or dance , then they do it badly which doesn t make for good entertainment . they rely on humiliation and conflict to create excitement . joe millionaire , where a group of woman compete for the affection of a construction worker who they be tell be a millionaire , be simply cruel . the emotion of the contestant be consider expendable for the sake of make viewer laugh at their ignorance . furthermore , the programme be full of swear , cry and argument , and often violence , drunkenness and sex . this send a message to people that this be normal behaviour and help to create a crude , selfish society . one american reality show , are you hot ? , in which competitor submit to a panel of judge for appearance rating , be blame by eat disorder expert a encourage the notion that appearance be the most important thing becker , 2003 . 1 furthermore , paul watson , a former reality tv show producer , believe they be predictable and just create more of the same and make our film maker lazy jury , 2007 . 
counterpoint : reality tv programme be not corrupt . they do reflect our society , which isn't always perfect , but we should face up to these issue rather than censor television in order to hide them . when adam lambert , an openly gay contestant on american idol , lose in the final of the show despite be widely regard a the best singer , many rightfully point out what it demonstrate about the homophobia of american society . to deride reality show a 'corrupting' therefore be misguide ; it be society who be corrupt and reality show that offer a potential solution . to solve a problem first require accept one exist , and reality show provide a mean to do that ; they be a window into society , permit everyone to reflect on the issue that be most harmful to society . as such , reality show producer should not be accuse of a lack of creativity or laziness for their programme , but congratulate for draw attention to important issue . 
point : reality tv be dishonest it pretend to show reality but it actually distort the truth to suit the programme maker . the show be not really real they be carefully cast to get a mix of character who be not at all typical . mostly they show a bunch of young , good look self publicist , who will do anything to get on tv . usually the programme maker try to ensure excitement by pick people who be likely to clash with each other . they then place them in unnatural situation , such a the big brother house or the survivor island , and give them strange challenge in order to provoke them into behave oddly . in the bachelor , where a group of woman compete for the affection of an eligible male , the intimate date they go on be film in front of any number of camera ; that be not reality poniewozik , 2003 . 1 finally the maker film their victim for hundred of hour from all angle , but only show the most dramatic part . selective editing may be use to create storyline and so further manipulate the truth of what happen . 
counterpoint : reality show be real ; they be real people operate without script and often , live . the fact that character be often cast to encourage disagreement or tension do not take away from the reality of the program , in fact it only add to it . the unrealistic setting of show like big brother and survivor do not take away from the educational value of observe how they cope . in fact , without such show , most people would have little concept of how a group of stranger would be able to survive , co operate and develop in such environment . as time describe , 'they provoke , they offend but at least it's try to do something besides help you get to sleep' . the insight therefore into the human condition be invaluable , and it be little surprise that viewer be eager to watch such program . what be real be not always the same a what be normal , the event on survivor island be no less real for be in an unrealistic setting .
