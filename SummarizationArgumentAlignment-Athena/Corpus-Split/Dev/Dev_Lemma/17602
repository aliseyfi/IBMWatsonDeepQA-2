point : the massive commercialisation of the games erode the idea of take part for it own sake : with so much sponsorship money at stake , win at all cost be the inevitable aim . the rule of the sponsor seem more important than the sport : interrupting television coverage of the event to advertise be symptomatic of this , permit mcdonalds to sponsor a sport event be another . as be the auction off of 'virtually every aspect of the games to the high bidder . '1 whilst a recent report indicate that sport be still at the centre of the olympics , 'the volume of commercial message drown out any compete narrative apart from sports' multinational monitor , 2008 , p . 8 . the olympic dream be that compete narrative attempt to weave the value of friendship , respect and excellence into the home viewer . 
counterpoint : commercialization ensure that the olympic games be still the games in which to compete . it be an amateur event , so by definition they be take part for it own sake . furthermore , a few break in coverage be a small price to pay for 3 . 5bn people to be able to see the games , and thus be inspire to play sport : that be the number of viewer estimate for the atlanta games . the sponsor do not really have significant control over the running of the games : coca cola's call for ioc chief samaranch to be replace be not meet ; ibm have to end it sponsorship of the games because the ioc be ask for more than they could pay . the ioc have the strong hand , and a wide choice of sponsor . without any sponsorship , many of the poorer country that be able at present to send a team to the olympics would be unable to do so . sponsorship , even a little , be the key to start to put all country on an equal footing . 
point : the use of performance enhance drug be sufficiently common in the olympics to be a cause of concern . not only do they reduce the victory of those who take them to meaninglessness but they cast aspersion over the effort of all other athlete . as simon barnes note in beijing in 2008 , the world be full of people declare that they don t care who win what at the olympics , because they re all on something barnes , 2008 . new drug such a the growth hormone epo be very difficult to detect , and the olympic authority be not do enough to overcome the problem stir the negative public opinion . though the ioc claim to be clamp down on the drug problem , there be still 26 case of dope at athens in 2004 , and 20 case in beijing allen , 2011 , such case only indicate the athlete take known substance , or substance that can be test for . the olympic motto of faster , high , strong be fatally undermined if athlete achievement be the result not of physical and mental strain , but chemical concoction . 
counterpoint : despite some well publicize case of dope in previous olympic game , the drug test technology be now sufficiently advance to deter most athlete . the evidence bear witness to this change a the proposition's statistic indicate . the ioc be come down hard on those who take drug : a two year ban for the first offence have be introduce . it also plan to make london 2012 the 'most test game ever' , with over 5 , 000 individual test , or roughly one for every two athlete allen , 2011 . as such , there be very little chance of a dope athlete go undetected . 
point : the ioc and many national olympic committee lack integrity , and this kill the games' spirit and pretension to fair play . officials work for the salt lake city 2002 bid be believe to have spend more than 1 million on 'gifts and favors' for ioc member in an effort to bribe their way to the victory . 1 furthermore , in response to a bbc programme in 2010 which highlight the corruption of member of fifa , football's govern body , the ioc be force to open an investigation into three of it own member who hold post at both organization . 2 the inability of the ioc to stamp out the corruption of it own member , or otherwise alter it voting system , reflect poorly on it commitment to excellence and fairness . if the ioc be charge with ensure the propagation of the olympic dream , it be set a poor example . 
counterpoint : the ioc have work long and hard to ensure that the corruption that mar the 2002 voting process will not happen again . the six member at the centre of the scandal be recommend for expulsion , three resign of their own accord , whilst others be warn mackay chaudhary , 1999 . as ioc president dick pound state at the time , 'the conduct of certain ioc member be contrary to everything the olympic movement have grow to represent . it dishonour all those who believe in the olympic dream . '1 as such , the ioc make clear that the behaviour of those member be at odds with the olympic dream , and reform itself accordingly . this do not demonstrate that the olympic dream be dead , merely that work need to be do to ensure it be always maintain . that work be be do . 
point : the modern olympic athlete be no longer drive 'for the glory of sport' , but by an appetite for excellence that can , and often do , override any notion of fair play or respect . the sense of fraternity that olympic athletes once have be become lose in the antagonistic rivalry between nation and individual athlete and the pressure not merely to compete , but to win . we should have some sympathy with athlete sometimes : very often , they be compel to take drug by their team's coach . the chinese swimming team , for example , be beset at atlanta by claim that they have adopt a systematic and untraceable doping regime to improve their athlete , with remarkable result . 1 to overcome this , the ioc conference in february 1999 recommend that coach should take the olympic oath as well a athlete , however the document itself be so tarnish by the regularity with which it be ignore that it be fast become a farce . the olympics therefore may still be a great event , with many great athlete but it no longer carry the association with respect and fair play that make it dream so appeal to so many . 
counterpoint : the olympics be always about the ability of athlete , with the support of their coach , to go to extreme length to win . it be a competition . nonetheless , modern athlete have not lose the fraternity that have mark previous olympic games , nor have the million of tourist that flock to all corner of the world to view their countryman compete . events be rarely troubled by dispute between competitor , winner and runner up be congratulate by all , regardless of their national allegiance , and there be few trouble report by tourist . 
point : the olympics have be hijack so many time for political purpose that competition for the glory of sport cannot help but have be smother . the munich disaster in 1972 be the most shocking : nine israeli athlete be take hostage by palestinian terrorist and eventually kill . yet the games be only suspend for 34 hour ; it be a if those who play the games be less important than the spectacle of the games . when the usa boycott the 1980 moscow games , they devalue still far the supremacy of sport for it own sake . in 2008 , a number of state leader decide to boycott the beijing opening ceremony in protest of the chinese crackdown in tibet . 1 in so do , they essentially pull the focus of the event away from the athlete and sport and use it instead a a political tool . that be not the purpose of an event found specifically to grant athlete the platform to shine . 
counterpoint : the olympics can be overshadow by external political issue , but it can never interfere with the sport that be it's hallmark . chapter five of the olympic charter state explicitly 'no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda be permit in the olympic area . nevertheless , even when politics have be bring into the arena itself , notably in 1968 in mexico city when two black american athlete give the black power salute on the podium , it have be at the behest of the athlete themselves . this have ensure that the olympics have maintain about the sport and the athlete , not the state they represent .
