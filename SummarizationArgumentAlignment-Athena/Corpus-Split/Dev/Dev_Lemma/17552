point : the ability to marry people who be already married present u with the chance to take partner that have already prove themselves in society a responsible parent and provider that be , to reduce the risk in marriage . it also mean that one doesn't have to settle for those leave over ; you can marry the person you want , not just the person that's leave . very few country have exactly the same number of male and female ; in the uae , there be 2 . 2 male per female , but in estonia , there be only 0 . 84 male per female1 . this mean that monogamy restricts option significantly . 1'sex ratio' , the cia world factbook , access june 2011 1 
counterpoint : the idea of take an establish partner simply because of their status be anathema in the modern age it imply that income determines suitability a partner , and suggest that the partner concern will forever be dominant in the relationship . that logic would see ceos with 10 wife and unemployed people with none hardly supportive of the everyone should be able to marry model this proposition argument support . furthermore , it be difficult to decipher statistic like these . many people don t want to marry . certainly , not everyone want to marry at once , which would be need for statistic on total population to be of any use . 
point : more provider can make great contribution to the home . it make the family unit more efficient , a more people can pursue career and bring in money , but due to economy of scale , less additional money will be need for each additional partner . for example , it be cheap to cook in large quantity than if each person be cook individually . similarly , additional people in the house win t need another kitchen or necessarily another bathroom , so therefore it s cheap to live in group particularly group with multiple income . in addition , there be more likely to be a person stay at home , which save on childcare . while it will not always be the case there be many way in which living in group can be more economical . 
counterpoint : just because something be economically efficient , it isn't necessarily well . the idea that one of the best reason for marry an additional person be because it will cost less in the long run completely undermine the ideal of love that marriage be base on . furthermore , in many society where men can have multiple wife , it be actually expensive , a the man be expect to provide for everybody as well a pay dowry , so it be economically unsound1 . if there be extra adult income , they must be share amongst the extra adult , and often get soak up in the high number of child polygamous relationship tend to produce . 1 isaac sagala , 'should sudan discard expensive polygamy ? ' , 25th may 2010 2 
point : polygamy reduce the strain on family life and minimise the likelihood of breakdown and divorce . polygamy reduce the desire for adultery by provide alternative for sexual exploration within the family unit . sibel Ã¼resin suggest that people look for a lot of quality in a spouse , and that it be unlikely that any one person can possess them all , which be why there be so much adultery in monogamous relationship . 1 
counterpoint : even if the marriage last longer this be likely to be base upon feel subservient to their spouse nearly always husband and so feeling powerless and unable to get a divorce1 . adultery be base on a desire for the 'other' , for something outside the known , outside the home . polygamy do nothing to combat this ; adultery still occur in polygamous society . indeed , polygamy encourages adultery a it dilute the idea of fidelity from be loyalty to one person , substitute the legitimacy of intercourse with many . in a study in nigeria it be find that men with three or more wife be more likely to engage in extramarital sex2 . 1 thom brooks , the problem of polygamy , university of newcastle , 2009 p . 5 access 14 06 11 6 2 ibid pp . 5 6 
point : the idea that the individual can only truly love one person be artificial and false , a product of a particular time , place and culture . in fact , in a study on human society worldwide , of 1231 society note , only 186 be entirely monogamous1 . polygamy be not about freedom to fornicate with anyone ; it's about cement relationship with individual one want to spend the rest of one's life with , just a in monogamous marriage . 1 george p . murdock , ethnographic atlas codebook record the marital composition of society 1960 1980 7 
counterpoint : marriage be about devotion to another , the give of oneself wholly to that person , grant love to them to the exclusion of all others . how could one have such a relationship with more than one person ? it's not possible to devote yourself entirely to more than one person . polygamy therefore necessarily involve the exploitation of at least one party and the denigration of the relationship that exist between the others . 
point : the law should recognise freedom of choice . if somebody want to marry more than one person , and all party involve agree , then the state should not get involve . we have a right to privacy , and a right to non interference in our family life . these be not absolute right , but they be important : breach of them need to be contemplate with extreme care and be not merit here . this be particularly important because some religious sect promote polygamy , so ban it also impinge on freedom of religion . 
counterpoint : in most case , some of the partner involve in polygamy will not have true freedom of choice . presumably , one of the partner will be propose the addition of another person to the marriage ; the first partner may well not truly desire this , but feel unable to refuse . this could particularly be a problem in religious group that be happy for men to marry many woman , but deny woman the same freedom . daphne bramham study a polygamous community in canada and conclude : within that particular group , those woman have absolutely no choice . they be separate from the mainstream community . 1 whilst a law that allow polygamy might give a handful of people more freedom , it would actually deny it to many others . 1 daphne bramham , the secret lives of saints : child brides and lost boys in canada's polygamous mormon sect random house , 2008
