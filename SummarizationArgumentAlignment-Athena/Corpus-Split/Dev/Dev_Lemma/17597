point : despite the fact that use a mobile cell phone be illegal in many country , there be still place include a lot of us states1 in which it be completely legal to use a phone even to send text message indeed one in three 34 texting teen age 16 17 say they have texted while driving1 . this have be identify a a serious problem among teenage drivers2 who be themselves more familiar with the technology and do not see drive a an environment in which it be inappropriate to divert one s attention . adding at least a year onto the legal driving age would bring maturity in all area and an increased awareness of the danger of drive whilst use mobile medium and communication device . 
counterpoint : once again this be more a question of experience and individual adherence to good driving rather than a question of age . if young people be more likely to be use mobile phone even where it be legal , raise the age restriction on drive would not solve the problem . every year child be become more technologically adept , so it stand to reason that this would simply delay any potential problem rather than solve them . more resource could be put into the implementation of hand free device , as well a technology which would prevent people from use phone in the car at all1 . 
point : few country think 16 and 17 year old be grow up enough to vote1 , drink alcohol2 or smoke3 . yet most allow them to get behind the wheel of a car4 , even though it be a dangerous weapon in immature , careless or reckless hand . society usually see 18 a the age at which young people become adult . shouldn't drive be one of the privilege ad responsibility of adulthood ? 
counterpoint : allowing young people to drive right at the point at which they be also able to consume legal drug like alcohol and nicotine be surely a step in the wrong direction . by allow young people the responsibility to learn to drive without the temptation of performance inhibit drug you at least give them a chance to learn the real danger and challenge of drive so that they will hopefully be able to make safer decision while drive . driving be also not comparable to drink or smoking in that it require a proficiency test , and those who drive have to adhere to strict law . young people be not simply 'let loose' in car they be taught how to use them properly and have to prove they be able to do so . 
point : human life be precious and whilst driving remain one of the most dangerous thing people do on a day to day basis1 , we must do everything reasonable to prevent death . raising the driving age will cut the number of accident on the road . in 2008 alone in the usa there be 6428 fatality involve young driver and passenger age between 15 and 20 . raising the driving age by a year or more will greatly reduce these accident and death . 
counterpoint : young driver do have more accident , but that be because they be not very experienced , not simply because they be under 18 . if we raise the driving age , it will be 18 19 year old new driver have more accident instead of 16 17 year old . with this in mind , option like have a more rigorous drive test or impose stricter rule on young people even after they have pass would do a good job of save life . schemes like pass plus1 in the uk or graduate driver licensing in the usa could be more widely implement , and statistic for country like finland where the driving test be far more advanced show the positive effect this could have3 . 
point : in most country there be strict rule that govern who be and be not allow to drive . practically speak , the infrastructure be already there to enforce an increase in the age limit one of the main aim of the metropolitan police in the uk be seizing uninsured and unlicensed vehicle 1 the age limit for licensing have no effect on the police's ability to enforce the law . governments already restrict drive to make it safe through law concern alcohol use , insurance and the age limit already in place . making the age limit high would simply add to this campaign to make the road a safe place . 
counterpoint : governments already do a lot to restrict road use to make it safe . unfortunately we live at a time in which financial resource for such venture be very limited and the police force around the world be often stretch to break point . for example , in the uk the police budget be be cut by a massive 20 which will undoubtedly have a significant impact on their ability to enforce the law . bringing in a scheme to increase the legal driving age would not only be expensive in itself , it would also require an increase in the amount of police on the road which the police themselves simply cannot afford . it have even be suggest that we already need more officer to make the road safer ask the police to enforce a change like this would just make the situation worse .
