point : the normal curriculum can only go so far a to teach and educate student about academic theory . but student whose only experience of school or college be one of rigid academic study may not be able to apply what they have learn in practice . 1 extra curricular activity encourage a diverse range of skill and method of learn that encompass the diverse need of student . for example , scheme such a young enterprise allow student to experience of practical business skill and valuable communication and team work skill . if the extra curriculum be give an equal footing in student life there will be an improvement in the student ability to grasp thing a a whole , because student will have receive a more rounded education . 
counterpoint : the academic curriculum be the priority of school and must continue to be give more status in school and college than the extra curriculum . students be mean to be receive an education and gain recognise qualification which will help them to progress in their chosen career . 1 and if extra curricular activity distract student from focus on their academic qualification , then they could be actually harmful . 
point : many child have talent in all sort of different area , and it be wrong to force them to specialise too early . 'every child and young person be entitle to experience a broad general education'1 even if a student do not aim to be a professional musician they should still have opportunity to learn an instrument . a career be not the only , or most the important , part of an adult's life school need to make sure they have interest and skill that will help them in their family and leisure life too . through equal balancing of academic and extra curriculum , however , the student have the chance to exercise their right , learn a diverse range of skill and the opportunity to be multi talented . 
counterpoint : students should also have the right to focus on the subject or activity that they want or need to . if extra curricular activity be so good , then student should have right to choose whether they wish to pursue them , rather than force them to give equal importance to something they do not wish to do . through equalise the demand of academic and extra curriculum there exist the possibility that a student may drop out because he or she may not be able to cope with the demand of both set of activity . 1 the right to an education be best exercise by give student the choice to decide what field their life would like to be base on , and about how to pursue these aim . 
point : most extra curricular activity be physically active , get the student out from behind their desk and make them try new thing . physical activity be extremely important for general health whilst ensure that student be expose to practical task , not just what be teach in class . 1 sports club and team give student the opportunity to do physical exercise in an enjoyable environment whilst activity such a the duke of edinburgh award teach skill such a map reading and organisation of a group . the outcome of give the extra curriculum the same status a the curriculum will therefore be well balanced individual . schools have a pastoral duty to consider the well be of their pupil which include physical health and practical ability . 
counterpoint : it be not clear that extra curricular activity need to be formally recognise in order to fulfil this role . the importance be exercise , not whether it be assess or not . many extra curricular activity be not physically demand such a debating and so would be of little health use . society need to ensure that student be taught specialism to an appropriate degree . 1 most modern career require expert knowledge and skill , which can take year to acquire . the prime minister do not play soccer or tango in the house of the commons , therefore they do not require such skill a part of their formal education . 
point : boosting the place of the extra curriculum in school be one way of address a weakness in modern society , a lack of civil strength and community . activities offer in school be vital in provide opportunity to learn the diverse skills help to equip young people with the civic spirit , initiative and organise skill to set up their own club , team and activity group when they leave education . an article in the guardian argue that 'the riot suggest that the education system must concern itself with a lot more than simple exam results' . 1 a successful extra curriculum often depend on build link between the school and the wider community , bring local enthusiast in to work with student , and send student out to work on community project , help in primary school , perform for local audience , etc . thus , extra curricular activity have wider social implication than the individual school and pupil . 
counterpoint : giving extra curricular activity great importance in education can be harmful to civil society a a whole . there be many club , team and group available for young people already in most area e . g . scouts , religious work , music , drama , sport , voluntary work in the community , etc . only give school base activity credit can damage club and group beyond the wall of the school . often pursuits offer by school end up replicate those already available in the wider community . for example , a school hockey team may deprive the local town s hockey club of young player , while school adventure activity might weaken the community s scouting and guiding group . this would be a shame a a strong civil society be vital to a thrive democratic culture , but also because group that involve people of all age possess great social and educational value .
