point : parenting class would need to be compulsory for a number of reason . firstly for all of the subjectivity regard parenting there be clearly some case where bad parenting be responsible for some of the child s failing . a morbidly obese 15 year old with a criminal record , no school qualification and poor health have , almost certainly , be let down by his or her parent . however the state have no way of know in advance a to which parent will struggle in this manner hence it be well if the class be for everyone . furthermore , it seem fair to assume that parent who be somehow socially exclude , wilfully ignorant or suffer some other acute difficulty in raise child , would probably be less likely to take the active step of attend voluntary class in the first place . according to a report on uk children s service referral to get help tends to be self referral by those who have less need whereas those with high need have to be refer by others before they will accept the help 1 thus voluntary class may actually be structurally bias to miss the case in which they be most need . a compulsory system be likely to offer far good outcome across society 
counterpoint : making class compulsory may make them less effective and useful for those who actually want to be there . much a happens in school those who do not wish to attend be disruptive and take up the teacher's time so reduce the amount of time the teacher have for those who wish to learn . 
point : the state have a strong moral , practical and financial interest in the raising of it future citizen . this be why most liberal democracy offer extensive and costly child support system include child support payment , free nursery care , parental leave arrangement to aid parent in raise young people who can be active and respectful member of society . louise casey , government respect co ordinator , argue that the best result come from preventative action : i think we have get to do everything to make sure we be tackle not just anti social behaviour today , but prevent the next generation of people grow up with sign of anti social behaviour in the future . 1 compulsory parenting class could be a mean to ensure the cohesion and prosperity of it future generation by raise the standard of parent they receive . 
counterpoint : financial consideration alone do not give the state the right to interfere in the raising of child and do not provide sufficient motivation for impose a model of parenting . state intervention should be motivate by the best interest of it citizen and paternalistic measure should be avoid when possible in all liberal democracy . in 2003 lord irvine criticise blunkett s plan for compulsory parenting class a an extreme example of the nanny state and a violation of human right . 1 moreover , even if the implementation of parent class be unobjectionable , one would need evidence support a positive correlation between attend parent class , good parenting , and fall in anti social behaviour . 
point : given that it may not be possible to use legal or monitor system to encourage parent to take good care of their child , make parent class compulsory would help prioritise the best interest of the child inhttp : www . fivecounties . on . ca document workingtogether . pdf 8 term of health and future opportunity without necessarily constrain the educational choice of parent . parenting class would help ensure that parent know what be regard as good for their child and would promote the right of young people to a decent upbringing , whilst only minimally impact on parent . in 2006 , the then home secretary john reid argue that 'by tackle bad parenting we be tackle child disadvantage and social exclusion . for example , 90 per cent of repeat juvenile offender have a history of behaviour problem a a child . '1 
counterpoint : it be not at all clear that parent class set up by the state and aim at further the interest of the state would benefit child and promote their best interest . 1historically , the judgement and motivation of parent have be the best mean to guarantee the interest of child . for the state to interfere with the parent knowledge of their child s need would be damage , not beneficial , to the overall quality of parent . 2 
point : in our time , when contraception be widely available and affordable , reproduction should be an active and responsible choice on the part of individual . parenting class would be instrumental in ensure that people reflect upon their decision to have child and understand the implication of their choice . moreover , if the lifestyle choice of have child be support by the state through tax break , benefit and entitlement , then it would seem that the state be justify in apply some minimal condition to people who wish to benefit from it support . so parenting class would be a mean for the state to safeguard it interest in have responsible citizen . 1 
counterpoint : the offer of state support for family do not justify state interference in childrearing . there be a fundamental difference between create marginal incentive for citizen to have child through such mechanism a the taxation system , and outright coercion , such a the removal of benefit or other significant state support . the former allows for meaningful autonomous decision making on the part of a citizen , whilst the latter place them in a coercive situation where their freedom be inherently compromise . this remove independence and autonomy from the individual . 1 the state should have limit power in make decision about what constitute good parenting . 
point : currently , information about parenting be scarce , patchy and inconsistent . it would benefit all if up to date parent information provide by medical staff , psychologist , nutritionist , educator and so on , be make accessible and standardise : all parent would receive the same basic and essential information . and information be always valuable and often appreciate by those who receive it . the charity barnardo s argue that those who attend their class be unanimously positive about the impact of course and be clear that attend them provide them with new skill and confidence in their parenting ability . 1parenting class would provide up to date and standardized information useful to guide prospective parent behaviour and it would not amount to impose one model of parent on all . 
counterpoint : first , it be not clear that parent class would improve the standard of parent for one , not all child need identical parenting and it would be too difficult to customise class or to respond to the individual need of parent and child . it be narrow mind to assume that basic standard information would be sufficient for parent to deal with the range of child s individual need . second , the state be not justify in impose one model of behaviour on prospective parent . third , information that be relevant to good parenting what be good for child be subject to change and it would be difficult to ensure that the information provide in compulsory parenting class be up to date . 1
