point : due to the rule around olympic football in regard to qualifying , which make it impossible for the united kingdom to qualify , this be a once in a lifetime opportunity for footballer of the uk to play olympic football . 
counterpoint : while the opportunity for a uk team to play in the olympics be a unique occurrence due to how qualification be organize it be not in itself an adequate argument in favor of a uk team . 
point : one of the major barrier of the uk enter a team into the olympics have be gain the permission of fifa , whose stance have traditionally be that the uk cannot play a separate nation in fifa and uefa football tournament and then come together for the olympics a one team , they must be either entirely together or entirely separate . 
counterpoint : it be one thing to get fifa to grant permission for the creation of a one off uk football team , it be entirely another issue try to get the separate national footballing body work together never mind have to harmonize the political pressure from the devolved scottish , welsh and northern ireland government who fear the bring the footballing nation together could symbolically threaten their growth or even existence . it be a misnomer to suggest that just because fifa have grant permission the barrier be low than ever , with devolved government gain ever more power the situation have become more complicated than previous year . the scottish would also state that the act of union analogy argument be flaw , many scots believe that they be force into the union against their will by the english and that this be the same situation with the creation of this unified uk football team . while the removal of the fifa barrier be useful to those who want a uk team it be arguably one of the easy practical problem to overcome in the creation of the team . 
point : the olympic creed state that the most important thing in the olympic games be not to win but to take part , just a the most important thing in life be not the triumph but the struggle . the essential thing be not to have conquer but to have fight well . 1 
counterpoint : while the olympic spirit be a noble one it be fundamentally too simplistic to say that by not enter a uk team the olympic creed be undermine . for the nation of the uk to sacrifice their footballing history which have a longer legacy than the modern olympics whereby the football event be not even take entirely seriously , be absurd . the olympic creed be simply a marketing invention by ioc international olympic committee in order to give the host nation , which spend million on host them , a justification for do so which stretch far beyond sport .
