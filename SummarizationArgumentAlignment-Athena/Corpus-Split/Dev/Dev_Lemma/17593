point : hosting create a 'feel good factor' . it be hard to put a price on the buzz that surround international sport event . think of paris during the world football cup in 1998 or sydney during the 2002 olympics . even sport success abroad can unite a nation for example the england rugby union team's victory in the 2003 rugby world cup in australia . governments be aware of the huge potential for boost national pride and national unity . the paris 2012 bid have use a well know footballer , zinedine zidane , who be the son of an immigrant to stress how host the olympics would bring parisians of all background together . it be partly because of this 'feel good factor' that so many people want their city to host the olympics 97 of parisians and 87 of londoners want the 2012 olympics . 
counterpoint : there be no guarantee that a city will experience a 'feel good factor' . in athens many of the event have empty seat a the greek team fail to do well enough to capture the local imagination . where tournament and game have successfully create a 'buzz' it have be because the host nation have do well england reach the semi final of euro 96 , france win the world cup in 1998 . the fact that this 'feel good factor' can be have even if the team be win on the other side of the world mean that there be no need to host the olympics in order to get it . furthermore , a study of british youth in 2011 find that 70 be not inspire to take part in more sport despite the medium attention give to london 20121 . in any case , any olympic excitement will be short live compare to the year of disruption and congestion which a host city will suffer in the run up to the game , due to the massive building work and security worry which be now necessary . 
point : hosting stimulate regeneration . the ioc be enthusiastic about bid that will leave a lasting impact and have look favourably on city that locate their olympic villages and stadium in deprived area in need of regeneration . the 1992 barcelona olympics be use a a mean to completely overhaul the port and coast of the city create an artificial beach and waterside cultural area that become a lasting tourist attraction . along with clean up area and new stadium , olympic villages release between 5 , 000 and 20 , 000 new home which government can choose to hand over a low cost housing a be propose for london 2012 . whilst these project could be complete without the olympics , the need to provide an overall package transport , accommodation , stadium , greenery etc . for a set deadline mean that there be far more incentive to get the project do . an example of this in london be the plan for a new 15bn underground rail system call crossrail , first propose over 20 year ago but only now be develop because of the attention surround the london 2012 bid . 1 the fact that international scrutiny will follow the building program mean that it be far more likely to be complete to a high standard consider the detailed coverage of the preparation for athens 2004 . 
counterpoint : any large expenditure in one area will stimulate regeneration . considering that the cost of host the london 2012 olympics be predict at 2 . 375 billion , expect to rise far high , regeneration be the least that can be expect a a legacy carlin , 2006 . 1 controversially , a large part of this 625 million be be finance by london s own citizen through a rise in council tax bill buksh , 2007 . 2 jobs be promise , but there be no guarantee that these job will last beyond the olympics itself . furthermore , the 15 billion crossrail system plan for east london be money not spend on fix the increasingly fragile underground line currently service central london . regeneration be also only available to those area who be fortunate enough to be host olympic event . this typically mean a couple of area of one city , use fund derive from a much large population spread over a far great territory . the east london regeneration expect for 2012 threatens merely to substantiate the already expansive north south divide in the united kingdom ruddick , 2011 . 3 
point : the olympics be a showcase . hosting the olympics can be a way of make a strong political point because of the intense medium scrutiny that accompany the game . during the cold war both moscow 1980 and los angeles 1984 be use by the ussr and usa to show their economic strength . seoul in 1988 use the game to demonstrate south korea's economic and political maturity . the beijing olympics in 2008 be see by many a evidence of china's acceptance into the global community and a way for her to showcase her economic growth and acceptance of the west . for new york , the 2012 bid be a way of show that the post 9 11 healing process have be complete and that the city be 'open for business' despite the terrorist attack . 
counterpoint : the olympic spotlight be not always a positive experience for the host nation and it government ; for example , the run up to the beijing games in 2008 be hijack by the issue of tibetan autonomy . the event design ostensibly to celebrate china's come of age be instead frame through their poor human right record . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy be sufficiently concern to boycott the opening ceremony in protest , cause significant embarrassment for olympic organiser . 
point : hosting create an economic boost . whilst none of the olympics of recent time have make an immediate profit , the cost of the regeneration and improved infrastructure mean that this be not a big problem as long a the loss be not huge . the olympics showcases the host nation to the world and most host have see a boost in tourism in the year after the olympics australia estimate it gain 2bn extra tourist revenue in the four year after sydney 2000 . during the game between 60 , 000 paris 2012 estimate and 135 , 000 new york 2012 estimate job be create provide skill and training to local people . 
counterpoint : hosting do not leave a beneficial legacy . as a study find in 2010 , 'there be insufficient evidence to show that major multi sport event benefit or harm the health and economy of the host population . '1 the demand of the olympics be very particular , an 80 , 000 all seater stadium , pool , horse track , beach volleyball etc . many of these stadium will never be use again after the end of the game . even in australia , which have a very strong sporting ethic , underused stadium in sydney be cost the taxpayer 32m a year in maintenance1 . in the long term , the money spend on these stadium would be much good off use to build affordable home and transport infrastructure which be design with local resident in mind rather than with the intention of impress ioc member . as far a tourism go , greece may even have lose out economically in 2002 03 a potential visitor stay away , frighten off by story of disruptive building work , security worry and fear of over crowding .
