point : the uncertainty of employment in politics be well know to every aspiring and incumbent politician , and prompt a delicate balancing act between one s dedication to the general public and posturing for future employment . current salary force politician to look to the private sector to find additional work in order to offset what be often step down , at least in monetary value , from their previous position take in order to become an elected representative . in britain , members of parliament earn 65 , 000 , a decent wage but nowhere near the salary many mps would expect in the private sector 1 . therefore , rather than force elect representative to pander to interest group to provide future security , it would be good to seek to counter the incentive offer by the private sector and for the state to offer to guarantee retired and defeated politician a pension , or fund to update their professional skill to increase their employability . the financial security such package would offer would also allow elect representative to spend more time in government and with the public they purport to represent . 
counterpoint : the state cannot ever hope to provide sufficient incentive to appease the desire of elected representative to make money , particularly whilst they be in office and in demand a employee . the reality of political career be that individual who have hold office be rarely require to pander to a single group in order to secure themselves a position once they leave office , rather the opposite in fact a they be seek after to fill a variety of post from academic head in universities to ceos of private enterprise or ambassador or advisor for private and non governmental organisation . 1 as such , the promise of a pension package or an update to their professional skill would be futile . furthermore in many political system representative be already award pension upon leave politics and have little urgent need to secure additional employment ; that do not however prevent their drive however to hold additional post whilst in office and to seek additional employment once oust . 2 1http 2 : inteldaily . com 2010 05 prime minister president access 16 06 2011 2 2oireachtas 3 allowances to members and ministerial and parliamentary offices amendment act , 1992 s . 7 , s . 13 . 3 
point : elected representative should be work for the people and take only their interest into account . politicians who also run their own company , hold directorship or manage extensive share portfolio could stand to gain or lose substantially from individual piece of legislation . this be likely to affect their vote and so distort the political process . at bad this can become outright corruption , a group with vested interest pay elect representative to lobby on their behalf , or reward them with lucrative directorship if they vote in certain way . 
counterpoint : individuals elect to public office have be deem by their constituent to be of sufficient quality to represent them . they will typically already have undergone intense public scrutiny into their private interest and affair . therefore to be vote into office be not merely a stamp of approval for one's mandate , but for one's judgement and ability to adequately represent their constituent's objective . the inference of the proposition that an individual deem intelligent and articulate enough to represent his electorate could not determine right from wrong and separate personal from public interest be manifestly hyperbolic . it far ignore the reality of political life which demand that if the politician wish to be re elect he must act in a way that accurately represent the view of the majority of his constituent rather than a minority group who be powerless to ensure his re election . as such , fear of politician have a conflict of interest be overblown , their political career depend on satisfy their constituent and to do so they cannot afford , politically , to prioritize their personal interest . 
point : the public have a right to demand that it elected representative work full time on it behalf . legislators or minister with outside interest will inevitably have less time and energy to devote to affair of state and may become pre occupied with outside interest or indeed devote time well spent advocate on behalf of their constituent seek to gain support for personal endeavour connect to their other source of income . elected representative be invest , through their election , with a democratic mandate and an attendant duty to represent and lobby for the interest of the individual who elect them . by divide their time and their attention , between post and fail to prioritise their representative duty they risk compromise their ability to adequately participate in the process of government . henry clay once remark that government be a trust , and the officer of the government be trustee . and both . . . be create for the benefit of the people . while the context in which clay make his remark have very much alter the fundamental message it deliver remain a relevant today a it be at the time of it utterance a trustee may hold no position which jeopardise his duty to his beneficiary , neither can public representative be allow to engage in activity which jeopardize their duty to the people . 
counterpoint : the public only have the right to demand only that elect representative work effectively on their behalf . if a representative can do so effectively and have time spare to hold down an additional post , why should he not be entitle to do so ? the majority of representative body sit only for limited hour per week and remain out of session for week or even month , allow many representative more than sufficient time to deal with affair of state and their outside interest . 1furthermore , the role of a representative be multi faceted , require a range of skill and a breadth of knowledge that must constantly be expand upon . as such , outside interest often mean that a representative be more informed of issue in a particular area and can lead to important connection which may allow them to lobby for the interest of their constituent more effectively . 1 quinlan , r . , 'ministers not tax by double jobbing' 20th february 2011 access 16 06 2011 9
