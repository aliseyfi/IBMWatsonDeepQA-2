point : the freedom of the press be protect in law throughout the world include united states where it be protect under the first amendment to the constitution . it be subject to defamation law but the balance be fine , move to a more regulated system would be an attack on the ideal of a free press and all that it have achieve . the idea of a free press in a crucial lynch pin behind the concept of democracy because how can one make a truly inform decision if their information source a forcibly limit ; on the subject of press freedom thomas jefferson in a letter to physician james currie1 state that : our liberty depend on the freedom of the press , and that cannot be limit without be lose . it be therefore important that the ability of the press to be truly free be not sacrifice a democracy and liberty would go with it . 
counterpoint : the line between the freedom of the press and the right to privacy be indeed fine , however the current balance be too far in favor of the news conglomerate than it be the individual . in the same letter , previous to the proposition quote from thomas jefferson , the president also state that : 'i deplore . . . the putrid state into which our newspaper have pass , and the malignity , the vulgarity , and mendacious spirit of those who write them these ordure be rapidly deprave the public taste . 1 what this demonstrate be that while the freedom of the press be important it do not mean that it should necessarily be free from all law , leave unregulated the press could , like people , become corrupt by the power the have over society . the freedom of the press idea should be upheld however this should not simply mean that it be above any governance . 
point : if the press be legally oblige to go in front of a judge before publish story which may potentially contain material of a defaming nature the process of news gathering would be greatly damage . while get the balance between immediacy and privacy be important bringing in the judiciary to look over all write material before allow it to be publish be an entirely wrong move . as well a be a affront on freedom of speech it would also overload the court with needless work , make the system of uphold law inefficient and costly . media lawyer mark stevens state that this idea . . . would shear the medium of the ability to report matter of public interest and thus look into corruption lurking in those dark corner the rich and powerful would rather be keep out of sight 1 
counterpoint : the amount of story which the press would have to bring to the attention of the judiciary would be a relatively small percentage of the amount total amount of story which the press publish , and not even all story with defamation shade in them will necessarily go to court . all a new law would do would allow all people to have the . . . the right to have an editor's decision to publish review by a judge before irreparable damage can be do 1 while the freedom of the press be important so equally be the right to privacy ; a the medium have an unequal freedom of expression it be only right to ensure that their power be keep in check to ensure that other human right be respect and maintain and not simply disregard due to the economic might of communication conglomerate . 
point : the primary role of a free press in society be to act a watchdog and hold people , government and company to account for their action , a a result news medium organization have a powerful role to play in society . due to this there be , in all western nation , some kind of regulation of the medium to ensure that false or libelous claim be not unduly make . the medium , under current level of regulation , have manage to continue on in it crucial role for democracy successfully . take for example the 2009 leak of mps expense in the uk that be publish extensively by the telegraph group . further regulation in the case of that story , in the name of control potential defamation , may have hinder the story come to light and such abuse of power would have go unchecked and continue on a normal . 1 while occasionally claim can be unfairly make and lead to defamation on the whole maintain the current light level of regulation will ensure that the medium can remain efficiently effective in it important role of make people accountable for their action . 
counterpoint : it be agree that the primary role of a free press be to hold people to account and act a a watchdog , however this can still easily be do without the need of defamation . all extra law would do would be to ensure that the ideal of many western nation that one be innocent until proven guilty actually remain in place . it be wrong to suggest that a story such a the 2009 expense scandal would not have be publish if new regulation be in practice because such a story with so many wide reach ramification would always be allow to be publish regardless a to whether there may be a hint of defamation simply due to the high level of public importance , new regulation would simply limit needle and entirely unfounded case of defamation . it be also incorrect to state that current regulation be fit for purpose , take for example the current news of the world phone hack scandal whereby numerous phone of celebrity , government minister and victim of terrorism be illegally tap , this be not a good display of regulation work . the problem in the uk in regard to regulation be that the press regulate itself ; allow organization with such power to effectively regulate themselves and sometimes against their own immediate interest do not work .
