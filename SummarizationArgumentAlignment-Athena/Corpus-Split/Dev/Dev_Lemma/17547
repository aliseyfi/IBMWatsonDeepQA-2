point : if top academic and those highly inform about the subject take issue with poetry , school pupil cannot be expect to fathom it . on december 7th , 2007 , the guardian , a british newspaper affiliate to the left , note that this ambiguous identity of poetry render it very difficult to teach ; but until education theory ask itself what poetry itself be , and therefore what the teacher be try to get across , poem will continue largely to figure a teaching aid , exercise and for teenager increasingly tedious , somewhat arbitrary puzzle . 1the canonised poet and their poetry be concern with adult life experience , e . g . love , life , work , history and politics , solitude , loneliness , etc . for this reason , widely acclaim poetry be deep and require an adult mind and mature emotional depth to understand , or at least draw something from , this famous poetry . 1 sampson , fiona , poetry be not a tool for teach other thing , guardian . co . uk books blog , 7 december 2007 , 1 september 2011 3 
counterpoint : while great poetry may deal with adult experience there be poetry that target a young audience and method available to teach this type of poetry . children s poetry , for instance , be not complex or dark in subject matter and use very regular rhythm and rhyme scheme , which young student will enjoy . if age appropriate poetry be teach in school then it give young people the chance to develop an appreciation for poetry and it various technique . this mean that in late year young people will have the skill necessary to properly understand great poetry . poems that require more mature mind to understand can , and should , be use to stretch student to teach about these context as well a about the kind of imagry and analogy use in the poem . using more difficult poem to stretch puplils will ensure they keep improving . 
point : it be like ask a student who cannot count to solve a highly complex algebraic equation ; completely impossible because the groundwork remain a nemesis . if the pupil cannot understand the basic of reading , write and grammar , they will certainly struggle to with more complex concept fundamental to the study of poetry such a similies , personification , metaphor and extended metaphor . let u take the uk a an example , for it be a country in which many student do not make progress in basic english . a report in 2011 voiced concern at the number of school child struggle with english and the publish some horrify statistic ; hundreds of thousand of pupil be fall behind in the basic after start secondary school , official figure suggest three in 10 be not make enough progress in english , accord to department for education data . 160 , 000 do not make enough progress in english . 1 
counterpoint : on the contrary , poetry be helpful to teach english . learning poetry involve chant , exploration of syllable and vowel sound . as the pupil chant the syllable , they read the letter that go into make that sound and so spelling will be improve . reading poetry aloud improve read ability because the student be vocalise the building block that form certain sound to make word . public speak ability will also be improve from a vocal exploration of poetry . 
point : given that the highly respect royal holloway university of london be one such institution that support this , the future of poetry education and even poetry itself do not look hopeful . sir andrew motion , professor of creative write at royal holloway , university of london , specify that ; poetry be a house of many mansion . it do pupils a disservice only to tell them thing they already know . rap have it own challenge and opportunity but so do many other kind of poetry , many of which be neglect in school . 1 eminem have cause much offence and controversy over the year with his homophobic lyric . this be just one example of why rap be not to be encourage at all , let alone award a label of so called poetry . rappers like him must not be promote a great artist in the classroom . it be unthinkable that rapper who promote gun crime , drug and degrade woman should be give a platform and even promote in classroom . these be simply not the value education can possibly support . 1 edwards , paul , why rap should be teach in school , royal holloway university of london , 28 january 2010 , access 1 september 2011 5 
counterpoint : musicians have for some time be award poet status . the artist and their personal lifestyle choice can and must be regard equally . bob dylan be originally describe thus ; he sound like a lung cancer victim sing woody gutherie . now he's a rolling stone sing emmanuel kant page 36 , uncut legends magazine 1 : dylan , september 2003 . in 1992 , he be describe a as good a keats ibid . if bob dylan can graduate from folk to electric to poet status , modern day musician must also be allow to follow suite ; to gain the recognition they deserve and become similarly promote . the poet and their personal lifestyle choice be separable from the poetry they produce . dylan thomas , wales' national poet who be greatly and proudly uphold be an adulterer and an alcoholic . however , this do not make his impressive poetry any less credible . we must not sanitise all the great artist , but accept that the great art they offer a artist forgive them their wrongdoing a people . if we apply the policy of disregard the art of every artist who have ever do wrong , we would soon lose many canonise one and several of those who be hold in very high esteem . 
point : in the uk , the labour party introduce the literacy hour , a programme that meant school be oblige to dedicate more time to basic literacy and numeracy upon their election in 1997 . however , a the aforementioned statistic have show , all that have increase be the number of pupil fail in this basic subject . there be 5 million illiterate people in scotland alone . all we know be that more time do need to be spend learn the basic literacy and numeracy . appreciating literature and poetry , the artistic side of the english language , cannot be address until learner have fully understand and grasp the tool of reading , write and vowel sound that allow for fiction and poetry to be produce . we need an educational programme that recognise reading and writing a a matter of urgency and literary and poetry appreciation a a luxury in order to reduce the number of illiterate pupil . 
counterpoint : it be unthinkable that a school pupil do not know who his her national poet be . english school pupil should be familiar with william shakespeare , scottish school pupil with robert burns and welsh pupil with dylan thomas , irish one with james joyce . familiarity with one's own national poet be a basic .
