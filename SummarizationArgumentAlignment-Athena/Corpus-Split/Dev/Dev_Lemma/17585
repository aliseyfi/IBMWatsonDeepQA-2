point : the foreign policy of the united states be first conceive a be one of strict isolationism . since the time of george washington , who warn against the risk of entangle alliance with foreign power , american foreign policy have be base squarely in the principle of non interventionism1 . by pursue this course the united states be able to avoid involvement in the ruinous war of europe that wrack that continent during the 18th and 19th century , sap their strength and ultimately bring about the downfall of their far flung empire . during those same year the united states be able to focus on it own growth , fight only when it own vital interest be at stake , and push it border from be just a small nation on the eastern coast of the north american continent to the point whereby it be a continent span giant1 . it be only during world war one that the united states break with it long tradition of non entanglement with foreign power , and it involvement in that conflict lead it to be embroil in the foreign intrigue and power game that make the 20th and early 21st century one of almost constant american involvement in war ; war that be always in far flung locale in which the united states' vital interest do not truly lie . in order to escape the entanglement of the international system , the united states must seek to disengage itself and to pursue once again a policy of concern for it own interest without concern for the happening of other state . 
counterpoint : what make the united states great be not specifically it isolationist philosophy , but it awareness of which philosophy be best suit to it place in international society . as such , pursue an isolationist policy now will not make the united states strong just because it do so in the past . the international landscape have fundamentally change since the birth of the united states , and even since the end of the world wars . the increased interconnectedness of people between nation through politics and market be unprecedented in history and cannot simply be ignore . by turn it back on the international system the united states only hamper it own development and success . 
point : popular opinion in the united states have be shift more and more toward preference for non interventionist and isolationist foreign policy . people in the united states be tire of the cost of foreign adventure , in both life and wealth , and have be clamor a of late for a return to a more traditional foreign policy . this be amply demonstrate in the rise of the tea party movement and it success in the 2010 congressional election1 . the tea party have be fight for a less intrusive , small government , and demand that state spending be rein in and the massive deficit dealt with . there be no good way to accomplish this aim than reduce american involvement in foreign conflict and in it large military presence around the world2 . by pursue a policy of non interventionism , the united states will be able to bring it finance back in order by not spend so heavily on defense , while also allow domestic production to increase through protectionism of domestic business . 
counterpoint : current popular sentiment do not support isolationism . average american citizen do not consider a total withdrawal from the international system a good idea . even the most rabid supporter of the tea party movement do not support so drastic a move . the current political climate call for rethink how much the government should do for people and how much it should spend , not whether or not the united states should be involve in the international system . 
point : the united states have at it disposal the most powerful military in history , and be comparatively more powerful than any single state have be in history . yet it force be stretch thin across the globe and embroil in ongoing conflict in several region , particularly it seemingly endless war in the middle east1 . the cost of such military output and the number of soldier station on over 800 military base around the world be unsustainable . the united states must focus it defense policy on the protection of it own border and it own people rather than get involve with the problem of other state a it have do in recent year . behaving a the world's police have serve to provide many country with the public good of international security , allow them to scale back their own military spending and let the united states pick up the slack . yet it behavior have not earn it approbation , but rather the ire of many part of the international community , as well a that of terrorist group who see the united states a an imperialist oppressor . the grow economic cost of this international security provision , along with the domestic security threat create by it create the risk that the united states could collapse under the pressure , a so many powerful state have do in the past ; just a rome fell due to it stretch it resource too thin , so too might the united states2 . by pursue a policy of isolationism , the united states can spend less while provide superior security for it own citizen . its technological and military superiority will not be affect by such a move , but will rather simply be more efficiently utilized . with a military dedicate to the protection of the united states and it narrow national interest , it can project power around the world without the huge cost of the current system . 
counterpoint : the united states be not suffer from imperial overstretch . if the cost of certain kind of military activity be costly , it can always alter them . in fact , a time have progress , it military have become more focused on drone and other less expensive tool of warfare . withdrawing from the international system entirely will not save the united states from collapse , but will only destabilize the world order and cause it more danger . 
point : the united states have spend the last several decade try to promote it ideal around the world by , among other thing , offer support to fledgling democracy and democratic movement , stag humanitarian intervention to end tyranny and oppression , and offer extensive foreign aid package to weaker economy struggle to develop . all of these activity have put the united states into a state of almost constant conflict . its intervention in korea , vietnam , kosovo , iraq , afghanistan , and others have prove costly in both blood and treasure1 . for all it effort , the united states have gain little in term of material benefit for it own people . yet the first duty of a state be to it own people . by adopt a position of isolationism , the united states can place it focus on protect it own people . instead of get catch up in entangle alliance that lead to unnecessary foreign war , the united states can follow a path of peace and self sufficiency that will allow it people to be free of the cost and horror of war and international intrigue2 . on the level of principle , it be the duty of the united states government to be isolationist , because only in that way can it fulfill it true duty which be to maintain the safety of it people . 
counterpoint : the united states sole duty be not just to it own people . rather , it have a duty a a member of the international community to contribute to the stability of global security and commerce . no country can truly isolate itself from the rest of the world , especially in the light of the inexorable movement of market toward globalization . the united states have a role , a do every state in the international structure , which it must not abrogate . 
point : the united states have become economically dependent upon the productive capacity of other state , leave it vulnerable to their influence and machination . its reliance upon china to produce much of it consumer good and upon the middle east for oil , have result in a major trade imbalance that be only grow . the trade deficit be 50 . 2billion in may 2011 with china alone make up 25 billion of this1 . eventually china , and , other net exporter to the united states will be able to pull it economic string , and thus dominate it politically . for the united states to retain it political and economic autonomy , it must rein in it overactive spending as well a it borrowing from abroad . the only way to accomplish this be through a policy promote domestic self sufficiency by mean of raise trade barrier with state and firm abroad . through a regime of protective tariff and force trade balancing , the united states can expand domestic industry and rebuild those that have atrophy due to foreign competition . it be through such policy that it can restore itself to the position of a net exporter and escape the economic invasion of foreign powers2 . the result of an isolationist policy for the economy will be a more self sufficient nation with domestic industry capable of provide for the need of it citizen , and one not dependent on any other state for vital commodity . the united states be particularly well suit to such an enterprise due to it immense size and wealth in resource and human capital . there be no need for such damaging economic relation a it have pursue , a allow itself to be tie into the international economic system only expose it to the machination of unfriendly foreign power and also make it susceptible to contagion effect of economic crisis in international market . clearly , the wise path be for america to protect it own economic interest through protectionism and isolationism . 
counterpoint : the united states have not be make vulnerable by it deep involvement in the international economic system . rather , it have only be strengthen by the ability to enjoy the fruit of the comparative advantage that other state have in the production of certain good and service . as the united states become more dependent on other country , so too do they become more dependent on it .
