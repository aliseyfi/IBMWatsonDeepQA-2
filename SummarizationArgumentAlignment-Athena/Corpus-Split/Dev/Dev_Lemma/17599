point : children do not have the emotional maturity to be responsible in law for their action . we all know that child cannot always make informed decision . it be for this reason that child in many country cannot vote or drink alcohol or consent to sex . children have not have enough experience of life and do not yet have the same mental and emotional ability a adult . they be often not aware of the consequence of their action . even where they know the difference between right and wrong , they often don't understand the difference between various level of wrongdoing . it be therefore unfair to hold them criminally responsible for these action . see for example the case of two boy of 10 and 11 convict of rap an 8 year old girl ; there be a suggestion that they believe they be only play a game , and do not understand the importance of what happen . 11 bbc , two boy guilty of attempted rape charge in london , may 2010 , 2 
counterpoint : in short , some child do realise the difference between right and wrong . where a majority of child at a certain age do understand that difference , it be right to prosecute them . furthermore , ignorance of the law cannot be take to be a defence a an adult ; when someone have the capacity to understand that theft , violence etc . be wrong , how can it be right to allow them to go unpunished should they commit such an offence ? 
point : we should address these circumstance rather than punish them . studies show that they be often vulnerable child who have grow up in poverty , be uncared for by their parent , move house a lot , be abuse , be victim or member of gang activity , and often skipped school . rather than send these child to young offender institute , often harm their education and train them to be criminal , we should take other measure . as in norway , for example , social authority should take action to secure the child's development through counsel or time in a special care unit . measures should depend of the child's circumstance , rather than how bad their crime be . this be more likely to reduce criminal behaviour in the future . in addition , there be issue about 'class' here . rich child be less likely to be criminalise because their parent can deal well with the situation and pay for good lawyer . 1 council of europe , youth policy in norway , 2004 , from page 57 3 
counterpoint : while this may be true , some of the measure that may be ideal be , a suggest below , one that require a finding of guilt . for example , it would be consider wrong to place a supervision order on someone who have not commit a crime ; such an order would therefore not be available to rehabilitate a criminal . 
point : given the serious consequence of be find guilty , it be important that people have a fair trial to find out whether they be guilty and to make sure any punishment be just . children often struggle to understand the trial process which may be long , technical and stressful . children be unlikely to have the concentration to follow the evidence properly and may not be able to give clear and consistent instruction to their lawyer . this can lead to great injustice if the child cannot adequately follow the trial because they do not understand , or be intimidate by , the strange setting and the language use . for example , in the jamie bulger case see above , it be note that throughout much of the three week trial the boy look bewildered and bore , and that neither boy give evidence . 11 wikipedia , murder of james bulger 7 
counterpoint : there be measure that can be take to limit the unfairness of the trial ; lawyer can limit the formality of the atmosphere , evidential rule can be use to limit the importance of not testify and use short session can ensure that child can participate . the difficulty of a trial be no excuse for not try to do it to the best of the justice system's ability . furthermore , the judge and the jury be capable of assess the evidence , and ensure the process be fair . 
point : criminalising child harm their development and make the situation worse . being label a a criminal at a very young age be unlikely to lead to a good understanding of right and wrong . instead , a child who do not understand the wrongfulness of what they have do may feel unjustly treat and feel bitter toward society . or the child might simply accept the label of be criminal and resign themselves to it . children who be label criminal be also likely to be treat bad by those around them , such a teacher or other parent , separate them from society . in addition , those send to prison or young offender institute be cut off from their friend and family and develop friendship with other criminal , possibly even share idea about crime . all of these reaction be likely to make the child's situation worse and increase the chance of future criminal behaviour . 
counterpoint : while this be true in some case , there be other sentence aside from prison or young offender institute see opposition argument three below . in particular , some supervision order may in fact aid supervision , while label can be avoid by use more neutral language a be use in uk youth courts . rehabilitation can be harm by not use some of the tool of justice .
