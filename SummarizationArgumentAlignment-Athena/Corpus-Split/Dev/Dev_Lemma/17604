point : apple have go to great length to make use their computer easy to use than pc maker have . mac apps all have similar look and interface . juul coolen explain that consistent interface design make it possible for user to actually use most mac application in a very same way , create a seamless and comfortable experience in the end . users be able to anticipate how the system behave and what to expect from it application 1 . this have be corroborate by people who have try both pcs and macs . popular mechanics conduct a usability survey that incorporate a panel of tester with a range of experience and preference that run the gamut from expert user to one person who have never actually turn on a computer 2 and conclude that overall the mac be easy to use . 
counterpoint : most people be already accustom to windows , mean whether macs be more intuitive be superfluous a they already know how to operate a pc . windows be already the os of choice in over 90 percent of worldwide machine . switching to a mac isn t just a matter of transfer file : it s also about interface familiarity and availability of software . 1 pcs be easy to use because people be already use to them . 
point : tests of speed on macs v . pcs all conclude the same thing : macs be faster . pc world test this in 2007 and conclude : the fast windows vista notebook we ve test this year or for that matter , ever be a mac 1 . popular mechanics verify this , base it test both on a panel of user judge the computer on subjective point , as well a a series of benchmarking application on both platform . in both the laptop 5 and desktop showdown , apple s computer be the winner , the magazine say . 2 mac hardware be faster than pc hardware , and mac application run faster as well . 
counterpoint : in reality , speed , stability and multi task on a computer really depend on a number of factor , from how many program and what type you have run to how much ram you have instal a soup up game or desktop replacement pc may well on paper and most likely speed test outperform a top of the line mac pro , both process wise and price wise 1 . speed be mostly a function of what one have run on the computer , and how good the computer be , not which company make it . because macs be more expensive , you can add ram to a pc to make it fast , while still pay less . 
point : the forrester research , a survey of 4 , 500 consumer , rat apple an 80 , which be interpret a good . however , gateway score a 66 ; hewlett packard , a 64 ; and compaq a brand own by h . p . , a 63 score that forrester considers poor ranking in the customer experience index . dell get 58 percent , a very poor rating . 1 bruce tempkin , the vice president of forrester , comment that the pc industry have indeed score very poorly , and that this ought to serve a a wake up call to microsoft . 2 this study corroborate a previous survey conduct by consumer reports , which ask for feedback from 4 , 500 laptop computer user and almost 5 , 600 desktop computer user after they have call in for tech support . peter cohen report the result : consumer reports rat customer satisfaction with tech support on a scale of 0 to 100 , with 100 be the most satisfied . apple score an 83 in the laptop survey and an 81 on the desktop side apple be the only manufacturer to top 80 in either category . the high scoring competitor for laptop range from 48 to 66 , and for desktop from 47 to 56 . 3 by all measure and in all category , macs have far good customer support . 
counterpoint : while apple may have pretty good service , their repair be almost as costly a buy a new computer . the pc retailer pc pro argue , the standard apple technical support offering be nothing short of scandalous . you could pay 13 , 500 for an absolute top of the range mac pro or 399 for a mac mini , and you're still lumber with apple's standard warranty , which comprise a pitiful 90 day , telephone support and just one year's return to base hardware warranty . 1 many pcs , by comparison come with long warranty , make the cost of repair much low . 
point : macs run into few problem when operate than pcs , because macs be hard to target and most virus target pcs . mikko hypponen , chief research officer at f secure , explain : mac be more secure , simply because it have less attack target it hackers exist codebase and expertise be on windows , so they keep create more windows attack 1 . paul vixie , founder of the internet systems consortium , agree , say that macs be more secure because the code base be small and more modern , and because there be few mac user , so there be less in it for the bad guy who make the virus . 2 although it be true that both can get virus , evidence show that pcs do get them far more often . 3 moreover , even if pcs aren t get virus , it s likely because they have to constantly have antivirus software run in the background , which slow them down . 
counterpoint : in reality , vista and windows 7 have more extensive countermeasure against attack and a codebase with presumably few security issue . mac os have few countermeasure and lot of easily exploitable bug , but the market share be low , make it a less likely target 1 . so , it may be true that there be more virus target towards pcs , but pc maker have take step to combat this . moreover , accord to one expert , graham cluley , it's not about the operating system that be be run on the computer , it's the fleshy human sit in front of it 2 . whether or not your computer be attack depends on what you do on it and how careful you be . vincent weafer , vice president of symantec security response , agree : all technology be subject to security vulnerability , include the web browser , common web browser plug in and common application that run on top of the operating system . so in reality , consumer can fall victim to online threat regardless of the operating system they're use . 3 so , although mac user may be target less , both pc and mac user be susceptible to virus .
