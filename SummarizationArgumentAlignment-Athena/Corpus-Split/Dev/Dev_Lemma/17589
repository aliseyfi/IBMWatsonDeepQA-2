point : between 1970 and 1998 when aid be at it peak , poverty rise alarmingly from 11 to 66 . this statistic alone suggest aid be damage to african welfare . africa begin borrow money in the 1970s when interest rate be low , but a rise rate in 1979 cause 11 african country to default . even after restructure , they fell deep into debt . while the marshall plan have be a success , the same approach would not favor africa ; a dambisa moyo contend , it lack the required institution to utilize capital efficiently . debt servicing mean money be pass from the poor to the rich , leave africa in a precarious global position . furthermore , country which have reject aid a an approach to combat poverty have prosper , indicate an additional correlation between aid and a ruined economy 1 . 
counterpoint : while aid appear unsuccessful for africa , the approach itself should not be criticize on the basis of result in one continent . western country have simply provide african country with generous payment allow them to stabilize their economy . it many aspect of life , emphasis be not often attribute to what resource be available but how they be use . though more guidance on how to invest the money may have be useful , africa itself must take responsibility for how it have spend the money . the evil behind aid be allegedly overreliance : a country become dependent on receive more and more aid . however , a focused approach to budget and organization of capital could certainly put aid to good use . 
point : to gear up to be successful trading partner , develop country often need to go through a number of key change . as well a develop their own economy and their manufacturing or service sector , they may need to build trade infrastructure in other way . for example , increase trade would focus their attention on such thing a good governance , the benefit of a broadly stable currency and internal security . although such development may come about a a facilitator for trade , in the best case scenario they may be see a structural change which will have a trickle down benefit for the broad society in the underdeveloped country . china for example have reform it agriculture , create a large manufacturing sector and be increasingly move into high tech sector a a result of trading with , particularly export to , the rich world and a a result have lift more than 600 million people out of poverty between 1981 and 2004 1 . 
counterpoint : the opportunity for trade be severely limited because of barrier impose by the international system . the argument make by pro trade proponent be often couch in the rhetoric of market economics . yet the international trade arena represent anything but a free market . instead , tariff , tax , subsidy , regulation and other restriction operate to disadvantage some country . because of their weaker bargaining and economic power , it be typically develop not develop country that be on the losing end of this equation . the agricultural protectionism of the eu and usa , in particular , mean that develop country be unable to compete fairly . 
point : whereas aid be mostly short term , particularly for individual project or limit to the donor priority , the other partner in a trading relationship be likely to represent an ongoing market for good or service . so when a develop country have the capacity to engage in trade with another country , there be a strong likelihood that that trade will blossom into an ongoing trading partnership . this will allow a firm basis for a flow of cash or good into the developing country , largely independently of whether the developed country be do well or badly economically at a give moment . this can be contrast to the flow of aid . it tend to be less predictable , both because it be manipulate for political reason and also because it can be quite ephemeral and so , if the developed country go through a bad economic time , the aid budget make an easy target for a reduction in spending a be show by the argument in the united states where the usaid administrator shah we estimate , and i believe these be very conservative estimate , that h . r . 1 bill pass by republican in the house cut foreign spending would lead to 70 , 000 kid die , 1 . european trade with africa may have decrease , but china s demand for oil and raw material be blossom , and africa be become a major supplier 2 . 
counterpoint : trade can be a short term a aid be ; demand be very cyclical so if a country specialize in provide that good or service it can soon find that the product they be provide be no longer desire by consumer , or that there be a new product that make what they provide obsolete . even if there be a long term partnership between two trade partner it may simply mean tie the poor country into a different kind of dependency . instead of the poor country be dependent upon handout it be dependent upon the rich country buy it product or not try to undercut it . 
point : while aid threaten the economy , it also pose hazard for society in africa . as moyo contend , it merely foster civil war a people fight over scarce resource that cannot feasibly be equally distribute . according to dr napoleoni , 1 . 6bn of 1 . 8bn in aid receive by ethiopia in 1982 1985 be invest in military equipment1 . 
counterpoint : resources will only be scarcer without aid ; further chaos and corruption will ensue . there would be no need for fight should resource be share out equally . if aid be transfer to government there be surely a centralized method of do so ; aid itself be not the problem . africa could escape the issue of receive payment accord to donor vested interest by administer a list of cause for which it desire support , accept contribution where demand fall exclusively within it category . again , aid be not detrimental but it careless distribution and allocation be .
