point : british university be face cut in government funding and a a result there will be no new place create to cater for rise demand . professor steve smith , president of universities uk note the fact that the budget cut that could soar to as much a 950 , 000 , 000 over three year would decrease the quality of education whilst keep the number of university place stagnant . in 2009 , 160 , 000 student who apply do not go to university . in 2010 , 75 , 000 more people apply . 1 governments in rich country all over the world be face squeeze budge over the next few year and will be unable to increase funding for university . this leave private university a the only way to meet increasing demand for high education . 
counterpoint : encouraging private university will not increase the number of university place available . instead they will skim off the student who can afford to pay , but who would be go to university anyway . this will leave remain publicly fund university have to pick up the strain , often with less money and just a many potential student without place . 
point : in the rest of the economy , when consumer be allow to choose between good or service , the high quality product be successful and the bad one fail . similarly , when consumer can make choice between university , and be put money on the line thus take a risk they will choose the good university , and consider the bad university a not worth waste their money on . as a consequence , the best university will expand , and the bad university will either improve or fail . the new college of the humanities for example be aim to rival oxford and cambridge1 so help to provide these two elite institution with the necessary competition to force up standard . this will result in a high quality of education be available to more people . 
counterpoint : universities can't be guide by an invisible hand : the condition in the high education market be not such that optimum result will obtain from this sort of free market idea . there be several reason why . first , demand for university course fluctuate , and a low intake for a course one year , and therefore decrease funding , could unfairly penalise other people study in that department , who be not free to leave and take their money elsewhere but simply have to suffer the decrease in quality until the end of their degree course . second , university don't operate in a true free market system : the high start up cost building , library mean that it be very difficult for new university to enter the market , even if standard in exist one fall . thirdly , there will always be those student who be poor and have to go to the bad university if they cannot afford or do not want the burden of a student loan . a poor student will either get a second rate education and waste valuable time and money or will opt out of high education all together and accrue none of the benefit , since graduate typically earn more than non graduates1 . 
point : privatisation of university allows for a great range of educational provision : university be no longer restrain by government target and bureaucracy , and be incentivised by possible profit to set themselves apart and provide unique selling point that will gain them more student : the current system do not provide this motivation because university receive their funding regardless of student number . 
counterpoint : if more diversity be necessary , then government can change the way in which they fund university , perhaps by give a proportion of funding base on student number . 
point : the majority of people in the uk have not benefit from a university education , and graduate earn more , on average , than the rest of the population . further , university accept a large number of rich people than they do poor people . a national audit office report claim socioeconomic background remain a strong determinant of high education participation . people from low socioeconomic background make up around half of the population of england , but represent just 29 per cent of young , full time , first time entrant to high education . 1 it be therefore wrong on principle to use tax payers' money to subsidise university , because when university be subsidise from a general pot of taxation , a redistribution of wealth occurs whereby the rich benefit at a cost to the poorer people in society . this be wrong , because we should be use taxation to attempt to mitigate economic inequality , not to exacerbate it . 
counterpoint : it be unfortunate that the current system constitutes take from the poor and give to the rich , but this be justified as long a two thing be true : first , overall , the government do redistribute wealth in such a way a to take from the rich and give to the poor , and second , the funding of university from the public purse be of benefit to the poorer people in society . in this case publicly fund university give the poor the option of go to university that they would otherwise not have , even if they fail to take that option up . the opposition argument explain why this latter condition be the case .
