point : across the united states , australia , and canada , native custom be often tie closely to the land . for example , while descendant of the sioux indians of the american midwest may no longer hunt buffalo , learn about traditional mean of hunting , animal use , ritual involve the surround wildlife , mean of ensure a sustainable food supply , and other cultural norm relate to the land give people a great appreciation for the land they now inhabit . exposure to tradition that have be practice in one's land for thousand of year help u to appreciate the legacy we have inherit . this do not just benefit the direct descendant of those practice these tradition but the whole of society . 
counterpoint : protecting indigenous culture be unlikely to have a significant impact on the general population . native group often live in relative isolation , thereby have little contact with people outside the community . furthermore , antiquate form of hunting and cultivate food that be use over a hundred year ago have little relevance to the modern environment in which people live . learning about these tradition be unlikely to impact the public's perception of it environment because the public be unlikely to make an emotional connection between these tradition and their modern home . 
point : the indian removal act of 18301 , the 1871 indian appropriations act , and the 1887 general allotment act be just a few example of legislation use to destroy native american community in the us2 . settlers in australia be similarly responsible for a multitude of massacres3 , as well a several decade of forced separation of aboriginal child from their parent in an effort to christianize them4 . while the current citizen of canada , the us , and australia be not guilty of the crime of their predecessor , they nevertheless reap the benefit of those atrocity while today's indigenous population still suffer from the lasting impact of oppression . when chemical company make huge profit at the expense of damage the surround community's environment , those company be expect to pay reparation . a government that destroy an indigenous culture must similarly work to reverse their destruction . 
counterpoint : indigenous population have no more right to special government treatment than other minority group . even indigenous population do not inhabit their current territory from the dawn of time , and many ethnic group around the world live where they do because they be push out of some other territory hundred or thousand of year ago . virtually every ethnic group in the world have be conquer and abuse by some other group . tracing the entirety of human history to determine which group owe reparation to which other group be unproductive ; rather , government should move forward to promote a good standard of living for all citizen . 
point : notions of cultural superiority virtually always influence displacement and abuse of indigenous culture . for example , when the government of botswana expel the kalahari bushmen from their land in 2002 , president mogai defend his action by describe the bushman a stone age creature . 1 this cultural insensitivity , in addition to the incentive of material gain , lead the botswani government to violate the tribe's right . by preserve indigenous culture , government recognize the value of these group and prevent future hostility . 
counterpoint : the government should rely on just legal system to protect the right of indigenous people , not cultural preservation . a constitution that enumerate right and a court system that scrutinize government activity be a much more direct and reliable venue of protect indigenous right than sporadic funding for cultural program . 
point : governments already protect culture so it be not a big step to apply the same protection to aboriginal culture a well . in school , student learn about traditional art and their national history . for example , the state of california compiles read list that largely include shakespeare , virgil , and john steinback , though also include ethnic author like maya angelou1 . governments recognize day like christmas and new years and fund program that promote the art . states recognize marriage and structure divorce and custody law base on cultural norm of gender role and family responsibility . if a government can protect the norm on one culture in society , there be no reason that the government should not also protect the culture of those who first inhabit the land . this current protection make it easy to build on , to make highlight more aboriginal culture , recognize their festival etc . 
counterpoint : governments also ignore or destroy culture all the time . historic and significant building be build to build infrastructure , tradition be lose through an unwillingness to provide funding to prevent it from die . when government protect culture they inevitably protect one over the others . this be nearly always the culture of the majority . instead it be not for the government to promote or protect any culture over others rather it should be leave to private individual and each cultural group to promote their own culture .
