point : the current security council doesn t reflect the economic reality of the 21st century . france and great britain have clearly lose their position among the most powerful nation and their role be long ago take over by germany and japan . they be the 3rd and 4th world economy . furthermore these two country be the second and third large contributor to the un budget and deserve a permanent seat in the council . moreover , a permanent member pay an extra share for their seat , japan and germany s contribution would bring considerable amount to the un budget the three large contributor to the united nations , the us 22 . 000 of the un budget , japan 12 . 530 and germany 8 . 018 thus together finance some 43 of the entire un budget . 1 meanwhile brazil and india have emerge a major economy and stable democracy over the past decade , and deserve recognition for their global importance . 
counterpoint : giving germany a permanent seat would hardly be a step forward in an endeavour for a more equitable distribution of seat in the council . the uk and france hold a veto power over any amendment and aren t willing to give up their seat , so add germany would mean that the eu would have three permanent seat in the council . that wouldn t be a fair geographical distribution and wouldn t , for that matter , be a equitable distribution either . 
point : at the moment many country be not hear in the council and some state may never gain a chance of be elect to the security council . this leave billion of the world's population without representation in the world's high body . how can india with over a sixth of the world's population be leave out ? security council expansion would make the un much more democratic a there would be more participant represent more of the people of the world present in closed meeting and informal consultation . expansion would increase the transparency and therefore the accountability of the council something that even country sometimes consider to be against democracy believe be necessary he seyed mohammad ali mottaghi nejad say iran believe that the link between the issue comprise the basic objective of a comprehensive reform towards a council that be more democratic , inclusive , equitably representative , transparent , effective and accountable . 1 
counterpoint : expansion be not the right way to increase transparency , a the number of informal consultation of small group such a permanent member or only industrialised permanent member in order to try and push though resolution would probably rise . reforms to enhance transparency and improve work method be already take place at a 19 july 2007 informal meeting of the open end working group on the question of equitable representation on an increase in membership of the security council , some suggest a more analytical report that would , among other thing , provide rationale for the council's major decision . 1 
point : in 1945 there be only 51 un member , so eleven council member be adequately represent all voice . today the un membership have rise to almost four time the number of the original one , yet there be only fifteen voice in the council . this mean that there be many country who do not have anyone on the security council that have similar priority to them , their view may well be unrepresented . 
counterpoint : non permanent member be select to represent voice of entire region already . increasing the size of the council would only make it more unwieldy a it would be extremely difficult to negotiate in such an expanded forum . the nature of the council's work require swift action and expansion could negatively impact on it ability to provide quick solution for world peace . 
point : there be a grow imbalance between develop and developed country representation in the council . four out of five permanent member be industrialize and four out of five be european . the four fifth of humankind that live in develop country have only one spokesman among the permanent five . giving africa , asia and latin america a permanent seat be a step forward in north south balance currently , four out of five veto bearing member be industrialized country and the fifth , china , be rapidly approach industrialize status . many in the rest of the world seethe at their exclusion from this elite group . africa , latin america , and the islamic world , for example , have no permanent voice on the council . without a voice , it be understandable why many country be unwilling to send troop or aid whenever the security council demand it . this imbalance , highlight by the iraq war , have make security council reform a hot topic of debate . 1 
counterpoint : there be a lack of consensus among develop country themselves on who should get permanent seat . nigeria , egypt and south africa all claim their right to an african one . the most logical candidate for an asian seat india be oppose by muslim country , who want a permanent seat for themselves pakistan s foreign office spokesman have politely oppose the endorsement india s candidacy in the unsc , say it will complicate the process of expand the un security council and increase the number of it permanent member . he have refer , a have be do on several past occasion , to india s bad record on human right , unsatisfactory relation with it neighbour etc . 1 spanish speaking neighbour oppose brazil s candidacy because it speak portuguese . 
point : the eu be one of the world s large trade bloc , have the world s large gdp , and represent almost half a billion people . a permanent seat for the eu would reflect those new power dimension . the permanent seat for france and the uk be base on the fact that they be among the great power and victor of world war ii . however , the global balance of power have shift significantly since then : france and the uk have decline and at the same time , the eu have emerge a a major player in the international arena . 
counterpoint : in any case , france and the uk be still amongst the world's foremost military power , with the world's large nuclear arsenal after the usa and russia , and the world's high military expenditure after the usa and china . by contrast , the eu have no significant military to speak of , and be thus unable to project power across the globe . given the mission of the unsc to maintain international peace and security , eligibility for a permanent seat should be base on military power , not just economic or demographic power .
