point : in many religion and culture the role of the mother be a sacred one . the bible , specifically in scripture timothy 5 : 14 and titus 2 : 4 5 , focus on woman s role a keeper of the house , who should bear child and raise them in the way of the lord . in proverbs 31 : 28 31 woman a a whole be praise for the successful raising of child and home , and a such this role be value more than a mother work . in the quran , mother be regard highly e . g . 17 : 23 , 31 : 14 , 46 : 15 . the prophet muhammad even state that 'paradise lie at the foot of your mother' . the islamic scholar majmoo' fatawa wa maqalat mutanawwi'ah explain that within the quran she the mother be to be give precedence over and above the father . yet for a mother to earn this regard , she must stay in the home above all else , and this involve not gaining employment outside the home when care for child . hindu scriptures similarly often state that one must worship his or her mother first vanparva313 . 60 , apastamba dharmsutra i . 10 . 28 . 9 . thus for many religion the role of mother be sacred . this mean that the woman should be view a privileged and value a a housemother , a god give position that be not available to the father . 
counterpoint : scripture be out of date when it come to issue of woman s right and responsibilities no matter how sacred they may consider the role of motherhood . focusing on the traditional stereotyped role of mother a the primary care giver be extremely restrictive for woman . it be such religious belief that have mean that social prejudice be so developed world wide that even when woman be give the option of let the father care for the child , they often feel that this be not really a possibility . this severely limit a woman s freedom of opportunity , and be likely to restrict her future employment prospect . as both partner have create their child , it be only just that the care of the child be assume to be share unless other issue , such a finance , change this position . regarding the importance of maternal breast feeding , few mother breastfeed for long than the period allow for pay maternity leave in many country . this be therefore not an argument for their staying at home for long than the period of leave . 
point : the bbc have previously record that in the uk childcare option be often unaffordable , and family with two work parent be often not much good off than family with one work parent october 2003 1 . there be more recent evidence of this from aviva s family finances report in 2011 , which find parent question whether they can both afford to work , due to the high cost of childcare 2 . workingmums . net report a similar situation in the usa , and from anecdotal evidence , such a a number of blog , it appear this situation be common worldwide . if this be the case , then maybe it be logical for mother to save on childcare cost and give up their own work . 
counterpoint : childcare teach child to socialise at an early age , and some be state sponsor . places such a nursery playschool or any form of group child care actually teach child social skill , such a how to share toy with other child , how to make friend and how to cope without their parent for a short time at least1 , and this be a happy , informal and easy way for child to learn these skill . kathy sylvia dispute the research illustrate by biddulph and claim that after the age of two , and in good nursery , child be no more likely to become aggressive than those who be look after by a fulltime housemother . she also claim that in the case where aggression level be high , this be usually dispel by the age of 11 . she base her finding on the effective provision of pre school education project , 2004 explain far in scrapbook . 
point : mothers who stay at home benefit society a a whole . the money that they save on childcare can be spend in other area such a pension , healthcare , or environmental issue . 
counterpoint : finally , why be it good for mother to spend time outside the home volunteer rather than in paid work if we be concern about the impact of separation from the mother on the child ? surely one be a harmful , or not , a the other ? if mother aren t working and earn a living , where be they go to find the money for pension , healthcare cost and environmental issue ? furthermore , if more woman be work , then the state would have more fund from tax . therefore the state would equally have more money to spend on these issue if more woman work than if woman stay at home to look after the child . if mother work for a living , they can engage in society more directly through their job , and they can use the money that they earn to make a real difference in their community . the money that be earn by a working parent typically offset the cost associate with childcare so leave the child in a similarly well off situation1 . 
point : early childhood be the most influential period in a child s development 1 . it be in this period that a child learn which social rule be to be obey and how emotion , such a anger , be express . also it be the period of time when attachment begin see attachment theory author such a donald winnicott or john bowlby , also discuss in scrapbook below , and many psychologist believe this attachment be essential to normal social and emotional development in the child 2 . therefore the more time the mother spend with the child at this time , the strong this attachment will be . mothers who stay at home can ensure their child get the best possible start in life . they can help the child learn how to appropriately express emotion , and create a loving bond . this bond will ensure that they know what their child be do , how to make them happy , and when something be wrong . 
counterpoint : attachment study have actually show that the best relationship occur when the child accept the fact that the mother will leave , but also know she will return , and welcome her when she do . if the mother never leave the child there be no time for this belief to develop and the process of develop healthy behaviour concern the mother's absence will be delay . furthermore , some of the study refer to by the proposition , e . g . , bowlby be base on very limited or inappropriate evidence e . g . , child wholly separate from their mother in institution .
