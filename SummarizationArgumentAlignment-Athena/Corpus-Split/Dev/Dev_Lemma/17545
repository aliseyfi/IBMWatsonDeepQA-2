point : a fence would help defend the economy of the united states during difficult time by protect american job . it be a popular misconception that immigrants only do the type of job that native bear americans will not take . many profession encompass construction , ground maintenance , housekeeping , and janitorial service actually have the majority of job perform by native born americans . 1 furthermore , illegal immigrant constitute a tremendous drain on various public benefit . these include medical treatment because no one who be seriously injured or sick can be turn away from the emergency room a a result of a law call emtala 2 , municipal service like fire and police protection , food stamp , and education in public school . every dollar that get spend on illegal immigrant be a dollar that could have be spend on law abide american citizen , who need all the help they can get during these difficult time . 
counterpoint : this assume the fence be efficacious and therefore the cause of the reduction . it be not there be numerous bypass , range from simple ladder on pickup truck to complex tunnel for the movement of people and drug . 1 while it may seem to be the case that the fence have cause the reduced number of illegal immigrant attempt to cross , in actuality this be because of the economic downturn in the united states . 2 , 3 if there be no job , it stand to reason there be not go to be an influx of worker . 
point : ironically , even mexico recognize this when it attempt to increase border enforcement along it own southern border with guatemala1 , 2 . if those policy be lawfully set by the people and legislature , then regardless of how efficacious a particular tool be , it be justified . it be clear that the fence be wildly popular well over half of the united states support it3 , and many individual be so adamant about increase border security that they be willing to make donation for these purposes4 . the social contract of the united states mean that the government be democratically elect and therefore accountable to it people . if they want to focus on secure the border instead of provide more extensive welfare program or reform education or anything else they could be spend money on , that be their prerogative . 
counterpoint : just because many people be in favour of a policy do not mean it be normatively justified . policies that have little to no efficacy and actually even create the opposite outcome than be desire be certainly not justify by this logic . people only want a fence because they think that it will protect american job and border security . if a close examination of the economics of illegal immigration demonstrate that immigration actually grow the economy , it seem nonsensical to continue maintain the fence . this just perpetuate racist attitude . 
point : mexican violence between drug cartel frequently spill over and threaten the life and peace of mind of americans as well . the council on foreign relations have say that mexico's level of violence and lawlessness over the past few year exceed even those in iraq or afghanistan . 1 that have force a costly increase police presence in border area , and even that often prove insufficient to quell the killing . but even if the violent common criminal be somehow suppress because of step up action by the mexican government , an easily penetrate border present a national security threat . the fbi have warn that it be likely that al qaeda operative and other terrorist group will use the porous mexican border a a mean of infiltrate the country and launch deadly plot against american citizen in future . to prevent the carry out of attack , america need secure border . 
counterpoint : safety argument be a red herring ; terrorism will not be effectively prevent by the erection of the border fence . we need a proactive strategy that gather intelligence and work with counterterrorism official abroad to disrupt recruitment and training center for terrorist group . 1 if some immigrant can slip through , so can some terrorist . at any rate , the 9 11 hijacker and other al qaeda terrorists traditionally have not come through the mexican border but rather from abroad and by airplane or seaport , or they be homegrown radical . spending billion of dollar in a vain series of attempt to seal ourselves in an impenetrable fortress simply help terrorist fulfill their goal of make u live in a culture of perpetual fear . as for drug trafficking , this problem be largely bear of the tremendous market for it that still exist in the united states . if the demand dry up , so would the supplier ; on the other hand , if there be still an incredibly lucrative market , no fence will stop them from ferry large amount of drug over the border , and most of the weapon the narcotic trafficker use actually come from the united states as well . 2 we need to look to other solution besides simplistic fence . 
point : illegal immigrant be openly flaunt the law , and permit them to enter the country in this way demean the hard working individual who immigrate legally . if people become angry about illegal immigrant because more of them be come in without a fence , this may also lead to the negative outcome of poorer treatment of latinos who live and work legally in the united states . if there be no or very few illegal immigrant , there would be much less tension in community since everyone would know that all the inhabitant have come there legally . 
counterpoint : just because something be a law do not mean that it be justified or morally correct . there have be many bad and unjustified law on the book of the legal code of many country . any mean of carry out the end of a just law that will have terrible impact be themselves also unjustified . when there be hundred of people who have die in attempt to cross desert or dangerous terrain to go around the fence in order to find gainful employment , that be a good indication that a policy be fail . 
point : the secure fence act of 2006 authorize the construction of at least two layer of reinforced fencing in high crossing and high risk section along the border . this include around the border town of tecate , calif . , and a huge expanse stretch from calexico , calif . , to douglas , ariz . , which be virtually the entire length of arizona's border with mexico . another section would stretch over most of the southern border of new mexico . an additional section will wind through texas , from del rio to eagle pass , and from laredo to brownsville . this would not only be a fence but will include technology to secure operational control of the border by use unmanned aerial vehicle , ground base sensor , radar , satellite and camera . 1 
counterpoint : the border fence be a waste of money . it and the associated measure be give a budget of 1 . 2billion i and it be not likely to be a comprehensive fix . if the fence just cover current high cross area then these area will simply move to more inhospitable area or migrant will find other way around such a travel through the gulf of mexico by boat a occurs between in the mediterranean for migrant travel from north africa to europe .
