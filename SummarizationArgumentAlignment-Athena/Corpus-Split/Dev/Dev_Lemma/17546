point : homeschooling family do not operate in isolation . there be extensive support network particularly in the usa the nation with the large proportion of the population homeschooling that exist to provide companionship , promote sport event and social function . in addition , standard social provision for child in civic society scout movement , sport club be open to homeschoolers . homeschooling be not a removal from society but just from state school . 1 homeschooled child often engage with their local community to a great extent than their schooled peer . 
counterpoint : interaction with other pupil be a crucial element of a child's development and involvement in club be not a substitute for the social skill learn in school . teaming building , work towards goal , be force to confront problem with and live alongside individual one might not like , or come from different background , be clearly do best in a school environment1 . those that seek to cocoon their offspring from the outside world merely delay the time when their child have to deal with it . education be about more than academic teaching , it's about educate the whole person , and that be best achieve by educate them within a school with their peer . 1 'school a a context of early adolescent's academic and social emotional development : a summary of research findings' rw roeser , js eccles , the elementary school journal 2000 2 
point : home schooling allow child to learn in an environment that have the need of one or a very few number of student a the focus of the educative process . parents be willing to invest in their child and can provide targeted provision that prioritise the learn need of those individuals1 . therefore , specific textbook that be tailor to the child's mode of learning can be purchase . state school , in contrast , be often very ill equip and under fund , lead to standardize text book and teach method . the home also lack the many distraction and disadvantage of school : peer pressure , social stigma attach to achievement , bully , show offs and general rowdiness . 1'virtues in to vices' in the journal of home education 
counterpoint : schools have significantly good facility and a much more appropriate and segregate learn atmosphere than the home . the state system pool facility to allow access for all child to sport and science facilities1 . parents be very unlikely to be wealthy enough to provide the plethora of thing necessary to a well rounded education . teaching within the home ask child to switch between 'learning' and 'play' mode in the same environment which be confuse especially for young child . schools provide a specific environment that be dedicate to learn . homes be more complex environment , ill suit to teach and the concentration require to learn . 1 'the cons and arguments against home schooling' in educate expert 2011 3 
point : classroom base education must , by necessity , cater for the need of the group a a whole which leave those the very bright unchallenged and those with special need fall behind and unsupported1 . the state often take year to recognise the need of student and they lose year of education in the process2 . in addition , even if those need be identify 'special schools' be underfunded and stigmatise . for many student with identifiable problem that affect their capacity to learn within mainstream schooling but be not severe enough to merit a place within the special need sector , homeschooling can benefit such student by shape the learning environment to cater for their need by be flexible to adapt . 1 'every child be special 6 
counterpoint : home schooling be not the best option for exceptional student . the state do not ignore or abandon individual that have special need and those with special need be those that most need the state's enormous resource to focus on their requirement . once a student have need of such a magnitude that demand it , they be educate in special school specifically intend to help them , with staff train to possess skill beyond that of a parent's instinct . even if it be the case that home schooling be well for the specific need of exceptional student , the benefit of education in a wider context override the objection to class base education . the experience of grow up alongside less and more able student produce individual with great understanding of their society1 . 1'teacher perception of mainstreaming inclusion , 1958 1995 : a research synthesis' scruggs , thomas e . mastropieri , margo a . exceptional children 1996 7 
point : family bonding be a massively important element of a child's development and be prioritise by home schooling1 . the value of the family be constantly undermine in modern society ; positive parental role model be find less and less frequently . if a parent be judge by a state vet process to be good enough it be enormously beneficial for society a a whole to approve be an environment that cement both a positive role model and family bonding . 1'the role of interpretation processes and parental discussion in the media's effects on adolescents' use of alcohol' erica weintraub austen , bruce e . pinkelton , yuki fujioka , paediatrics , 2000 
counterpoint : a school education be not mutually exclusive with family bonding . just because a child attend school do not mean that their parent lose all influence upon their moral development . it be important for child to have a variety of different role model around them1 . there be also no guarantee that the moral structure that parent might be instill in their child away from any effective monitoring be beneficial . 1 'why a positive role model is important for children' , caitlin erwin , livestrong . com 2010 10 
point : parents who take their child out of school , or choose to home school due to apprehension over the quality of state education , should be entitle to do so provide the child be good off a a result . to ensure they be not neglect , parent hop to home school must both register the fact they be home school their child and submit to regular , state inspection of the child's progress . if the child be deem to be fall behind his age group , the parent may be force to return the child to a school . the parent should be give standard of teach that they must adhere to before the inspection occur , and the standard should be sufficiently flexible to reflect child learn at different speed and that not all children's development reflect fairly on their teacher . 
counterpoint : merely ensure the registration of a child a be home school do not fulfill the state's right to ensure that all child be give a satisfactory education . inspections will help , but parent will nevertheless be unable to provide to their child the opportunity present in a school environment . the inspection should require that parent offer their child at least an equivalent level of teach to that he or she would receive at a school , yet how be a parent go to teach practical science ? how be they go to dissect animal ? the inevitable result of such a policy therefore would be the acceptance of inadequate education . the only policy that respect and protect a child's right to education be to ban home school altogether . 
point : the state constantly fail those with great faith need in school . there be numerous example of failure of accommodation : ignorant provision for prayer time , ban of religious dress , unwitting subjection of student to religious festival that be manifestly unsuitable1 . if parent want to avoid such peril altogether , and teach their child within an environment that caters for their religious need then that be and should be their right . 1'rise in racism in the playground' bbc news 2007 
counterpoint : those that wish to be educate in a religious environment have the chance to send them to a religious school the quality of which can be monitor by the state1 . there be great danger involve in exclusivity of faith . the adherent of all religion shouldn't shut themselves away , but rather engage in society a a whole , and understand other people's belief and point of view . 1'gove defends faith schools' , riazat butt , guardian . co . uk 2011
