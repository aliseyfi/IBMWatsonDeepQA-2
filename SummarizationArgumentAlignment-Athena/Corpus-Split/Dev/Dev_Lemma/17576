point : the icc be uniquely beneficial because of it intention to be a permanent force that will always hold people accountable , instead of slowly react to crime after the fact . it be intend to be universal and apply to every situation without mandate the creation of a new tribunal every time something happens , and may be even more effective than tribunal at respond to crime . even though tribunal such a the one for the former yugoslavia and rwanda may have work , they be necessarily limit in scope and cannot be apply on a large scale , which be what be need . 1 additionally , those tribunal be relatively ineffective , a they take two year to set up , and rely on establish new tribunal every single time waste precious time . doing so would also let small but still serious crime slip under the radar , a they would not warrant the creation of a new tribunal , but may still count a a crime against humanity . 2 
counterpoint : individual tribunal be actually good at address the specific situation . 
point : the icc demonstrate that there be an exist legal court that will hold individual accountable should they decide to commit grave crime . the mere existence of the court and the possibility of prosecution even if not 100 be beneficial in term of deter future atrocity . no leader want to lose power , and an icc warrant limit the movement and liberty of leader . this be empirically true in uganda , high ranking official of the lord s resistance army specifically cite potential prosecution by the icc a a reason they put down their arm . lra official like joseph kony have to spend valuable time on evade the icc that would otherwise be use to perpetuate crime , show that there be still marginal benefit even if leader themselves be not always apprehend . i 
counterpoint : deterrence only work if the court actually prosecute people ; however , it crippling inefficiency render it deterrent effect nonexistent . 
point : the only way to ensure that leader get what they deserve be to establish a free standing , independent court that hold people accountable . the icc act a a permanent international court a oppose to tribunal set up by a specific group of nation . 1 by issue arrest warrant for leader who would otherwise continue their action without any blame , the icc attempt to punish them . the goal be to ensure that no individual get away with commit terrible crime . additionally , the court give victim a role in the process , have the power to give them reparation , and ensure they see criminal bring to justice . 2 the court have not punish anyone yet because it be still considerably young , but have proceeding go on currently . 
counterpoint : pursuance by the icc doesn't actually result in punishment of the leader ; empirically , it have actually strengthen criminals' power after criticize them . 
point : in today's world , crime be no longer confine to single nation and affect the world due to the effect of globalization . an international court be necessary a a global solution to problem that often involve multiple actor ; a permanent international court account for all party involve . 1 for example the lord's resistance army have be mostly active in uganda but have often hide from the ugandan military by cross into southern sudan or the democratic republic of congo . because it be not limit to a specific territory , the icc have truly global jurisdiction and therefore be most appropriate give the recent rise of international crime . joining the icc would also encourage nation to recognize that crime be no longer confine to specific border and that the notion of territoriality provide a dangerously limited view of the scope of crime today ; ratify the rome statute would force nation to recognize that domestic and international law inevitably interact . 2 the domestic foreign distinction have allow state to ignore or commit certain atrocity in the name of national interest . 
counterpoint : the icc actually fail to account for the individual nature of crime and be not the best solution for a globalizing world because it promote retribution at the expense of peace . 
point : there be a grow global consensus that crimes against humanity need to be punish , a demonstrate by the tribunal to address the crime of yugoslavia and rwanda . the question be no longer whether we should set up an international court but rather how to best do it , and the icc give the international community a framework within which to work to establish a strong court . 1 rejection of the icc have become a symbol of rejection of international norm , and country that have refuse to ratify the rome statute in the name of national interest , such a the united states , have be see a imperialist , isolationist , and against global effort to tackle important issue . 
counterpoint : promoting the icc will only far split the global community by allow the court to become a political tool .
