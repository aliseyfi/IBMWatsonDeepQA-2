point : there have long be a debate a to whether aid or trade be more effective in promote development and cooperative relationship . being interlock through trading relationship decrease the likelihood of war . if you be engage in a mutually beneficial relationship with other country , then there be no incentive to jeopardize this relationship through aggression . it lead to more cooperative relationship because trading partner have incentive to consider the concern of their trade partner since their economic health be at stake . this promote peace , which be universal good . in 1996 , thomas friedman famously point out that no two country with a mcdonalds a sign of western liberal economic policy have ever go to war together . 1 academic study have show that this be specifically a result of free trade . in 2006 solomon polachek of suny binghamton and carlos seiglie of rutgers find that the last 30 year have show that economic freedom be 50 time more likely to reduce violence between country than democracy2 . erik gartzke of columbia university rat country economic freedom on a scale of 1 least free to 10 most free . he analyze military conflict between 1816 and 2000 and find that country with a 2 or less on the economic freedom scale be 14 time more likely to be involve in armed conflict than those with an 8 or higher2 . aside from war , free trade also solidify country alliance . for example , the us want to begin a free trade relationship with south korea to create a concrete partnership that will ultimately lead to great cooperation3 . free trade promotes global connection and peace and therefore be a beneficial force . 
counterpoint : free trade be the economic policy that many liberal country who be less likely to go to war with each other have choose . it s not the policy that make them liberal . these study show such a strong correlation , because the country that have choose free trade be largely a huge block of country that already get along , particularly the eu country and the us . these country already have the productive relationship necessary for peace . and history have show that those relationship can be foster without resort to free trade . for example , for many year after world war ii , japan protect many national industry , but it be a peaceful country with a productive relationship with the west . therefore , the cost of free trade be not necessary to achieve that benefit since it can be foster under different condition . 
point : operating at maximum productivity be one of the most important aspect of an efficient economy . the right resource and technology must be combine to produce the right amount of good to be sell for the right price . therefore all market should strive for high efficiency . in order to maximize efficiency in the international economy , country need to utilize their comparative advantage . this mean produce what you be best at make , compare to other country . if mary be the best carpenter and lawyer in the us , but make more money be a lawyer , she should devote more of her time to law and pay someone for her carpentry need . mary have an absolute advantage in law and carpentry , but someone else have a comparative advantage in carpentry1 . comparatively it make more sense for someone else to do the carpentry , and for mary to be the lawyer . it be the same in the international economy . countries can be more efficient and productive if they produce what they be best at base on their domestic resource and population , and trade for other good . this promote efficiency and low price . free trade enhance this . the doha round that be currently be debate in the world trade organization would reduce trade barrier and promote free trade , economy of scale , and efficient production of good . it be estimate that the doha round would increase the global gdp by 150 billion alone just by promote free trade2 . free trade lead to specialization and efficient production , which ultimately would increase the size of the global economy and the individual economy in it . 1 library of economics and liberty , comparative advantage , 7 
counterpoint : for country that be dependent on their resource and lack developed industry , free trade do not promote efficiency . free trade make them overly dependent on their resource , which other country be come in and buying . this be because their domestic industry cannot compete with those of the developed world , so they have difficulty foster sector besides raw good . they be force to rely on supply material , rather than be able to build innovative industry . that do not offer efficiency , it just suppress economy . for example nigeria be dependent on oil for 95 of foreign exchange earnings and 80 of their budget money1 . trading oil be not make it a more diversified , sophisticated economy . 1 cia world fact book , nigeria , cia , 9 http : en . wikipedia . org wiki comparative_advantage 10 
point : free trade reduces poverty for two reason . first , it create direct pull up a columbia economist , jagdish bhagwati call it because it create demand for a country's good and industry and thus employ the poor and expand jobs1 . additionally it create more revenue for government that can be directly target towards anti poverty program . independent research xavier sala i martin at columbia university estimate that poverty have be reduce by 50 million people in the developing world during the era of free trade , since 19871 . hong kong , singapore , south korea , and taiwan have be liberalize trade for the past 40 year and have not suffer from one dollar per day poverty in the last 20 years1 . if agricultural subsidy be remove from developed country , food would become more expensive a there would be few producer , and poor farmer would have a good shot at compete and make a living . free trade promote the necessary monetary flow and demand for good to increase job and sustainably grow an economy to reduce poverty . prices be low , more product be available , and the poor be able to achieve a high standard of living . 
counterpoint : therefore , there be no empirical evidence that prove that poverty be reduce . if country remove all agricultural subsidy domestic production would decrease and world food price would increase . poor country that import food will suffer from increase food price due to trade liberalization . 45 of the least developed country on earth import more food than they export in 1999 , so there be many country that could be severely harm by increase food prices1 . 
point : through global competition , specialization , and access to technology , free trade and openness allow country to grow faster india and china start in the 1980s with restrictive trade policy , but a they have liberalize they have also improve their growth enormously1 . the international trade commission estimate that a free trade agreement between just colombia and the us would increase the us gdp by 2 . 5 billion2 . when industry have to compete with competition around the world , they be push towards innovation and efficiency . entrepreneurs be more productive if they have to compete . free trade increase access to technology which also increase overall development . because of free trade , price be low for everyone . trade offer benefit to both develop and develop nation by encourage competition , efficiency , low price , and open up new market to tap into . 
counterpoint : although free trade may promote innovation and growth , because of issue like dump where rich country sell their product very cheaply in poorer country and make it impossible for local industry to compete , or job be export to place where labor be cheap , free trade have significant cost and do not necessarily foster benefit for all . it be necessary to grow infant industry and create job , and free trade hurt both .
