point : youth crime be a major and grow problem , often involve both drug and violence . particularly worrying be the rise of youth gang who can terrorise urban area and create a social climate in which criminality become a norm . imposing youth curfew can help to solve these problem , a they keep young people off the street , and therefore out of trouble , and prevent them from congregate in the hour of darkness . police in philadelphia have find curfew effective in the prevention of gang violence : the measure have be successful in help to curb violent attack by teen mob that have severely injured several people in recent month , city official say . 1 
counterpoint : curfews be largely ineffective in prevent crime . curfews do not target the right time of day a most juvenile crime appear to take place between 3 p . m . and 8 p . m . , after the end of school and before work parent return home , rather than in the hour cover by curfew . there be many report provide evidence that juvenile curfew do not have a significant effect upon crime figure . 
point : the use of child curfew can help to protect vulnerable child . although responsible parent do not let young child out in the street after dark , not all parent be responsible and inevitably their child suffer , both from crime and in accident , and be likely to fall into bad habit . sir ian blair former chief commissioner of the metropolitan police argue that curfew be aim at safeguard youngster and stop gang cause trouble . 1 society should ensure that such neglected child be return home safely and that their parent be make to face up to their responsibility . 2 
counterpoint : although protect child domestic abuse be of vital importance curfew be not the most appropriate way of do so . problems at home may be the reason the young person spend so much time out on the street in the first place . if that be the case , it could be dangerous to force them to stay where they may be at risk of abuse . also , curfew infringe upon the right of parent to bring up their child a they choose . simply because we dislike the way some parent treat their child should not mean that we intervene to stop it ; should we intervene in family where conservative religious belief be preach ? 1 
point : very few child be go to be out late at night without an adult or very good reason . this help make curfew enforceable a the police will be patrol anyway , and any responsible adult can report child who be out after curfew . the curfew could therefore be for all young people , define a those under the age of 18 , begin at 10pm on both weeknight and weekend and end at sunrise , with the exception like those note in the introduction . curfew violation be punishable by fine and penalty assessment . in los angeles these total 675 , and violation may also result in community service and driver's license restriction . the amount can vary with philadelphia only have a 250 fine . 1 
counterpoint : curfews be not enforceable even if they be well know by resident and anyone can report those break curfew . it simply mean that young people be try to avoid the police so that they do not get fin . the police be only ever likely to catch a small number of those who be violate the curfew result in there be little deterrence . 
point : other scheme aim at reduce youth crime be highly effective but work best in conjunction with curfew . as the national crime prevention council state : a curfew alone win t stop crime . more preventive measure , include recreational activity and job opportunity , be need to reach out to young people and keep them from commit crime . 1 in area with a whole culture of lawlessness a curfew take the basically law abide majority off the street , allow the police to engage with the most difficult element . curfews be a tool in the struggle to improve life in run down area ; they often use for relatively short period of a few week or month in order to bring a situation under control so that other measure can be put in place and give a chance to work . 
counterpoint : a number of alternative strategy exist which be likely to do more to reduce youth crime . for example , rather than a blanket curfew cover all young people , individual curfew could be impose upon particular trouble maker , perhaps involve electronic tagging , break up gang without label an entire age group a criminal . a scottish scheme put plenty of police officer on the street at night with a brief to engage with young people , deter crime while steer them towards a range of youth activity available at club set up by the local council . 
point : there be no good reason for child to be out unaccompanied late at night , so a curfew be not really a restriction upon their liberty . where the child do have good reason to be out they can be cover by the exception . they would be good off at home do schoolwork , school often set more than an hour a night which the child should be do . the time would also be good spent interact with the rest of their family . 
counterpoint : children in their mid teen have many legitimate reason to be out at night without adult . many will have part time job , for example in fast food restaurant or deliver newspaper . others will wish to participate in activity such a church group , youth club or school trip . whilst there be clause for allow such activity , the fear of not be believe would be a serious chill effect on uptake . requiring adult always to take them to and from such activity be unreasonable and will ensure that many never take place in the first place , either because adult be unwilling , or be unable to do so . 1
