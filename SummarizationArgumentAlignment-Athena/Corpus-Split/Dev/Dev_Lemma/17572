point : in the united states , there be currently very different identification requirement for vote from state to state , mean that people often lose their vote when they change their place of residence . all state could require a photo id , or the country could adopt a national voter identification standard , base on the 2008 federal standard for american driving license often call the real id card . these action would ensure against voter fraud and make it easy for people to maintain an active citizenship . in addition to cut down on lose vote , this system would make the electoral process more legitimate in the eye of the public , a factor that could itself raise voter turnout . 
counterpoint : if a country be to simply require ids , it would discriminate against less well off people who be less likely to have id , and with a national voting identification system , it would infringe upon it citizens' privacy . there be several objection to a national voting identification standard . in the united states , voting procedure be administer by the state , and the federal government should not interfere in their affair . if uniformity be desirable , it would be good to scrap all voter identification law , return to the previous situation , in which you simply register to vote when you move and don't need special identification at the poll booth . finally , a national identity card be in itself an invasion of privacy , lead the way to a police state and the danger associate with poor data management on the part of the government , include identity theft . especially in an age when all of this information would be store on internet database , the risk of hacker access a national identification system be too high . 
point : there be a long history of voter impersonation throughout the united states , where there have be vary level of identification law . in their book , dirty little secrets : the persistence of corruption in american politics , larry sabato and glenn simpson write , for much of the last century and a good part of this century , election in many state and locality become contest of the voting fraud capacity of various faction and party . 1 they go on to cite many case of fraud throughout history , from new york city in 1844 to california in 1996 . one recent example of voter fraud be in 2010 in the u . k . , where identification be not require , when the daily mail publish claim of a massive postal vote rigging , and a journalist for the independent be allegedly beat while investigate fraud in eastern london2 . voter fraud not only interfere with individual election , but also undermines voter confidence in representative government generally . identification requirement be the most direct and effective way of combat election fraud . as such , state have a compelling interest in implement these law . even in case where evidence of voter fraud have not yet be proven , it can logically be assume that an electoral system will have more integrity if voter be require to show identification . regardless of actual case of voter fraud , a system with identification law will encourage high voter turnout , because citizen will perceive the system a have more integrity . voter fraud exists , but evidence of it occurrence in the specific place where voter identification requirement be be consider be not necessary in order to justify the new law ; voter should have to identify themselves no matter what . 1 rant world blog . a brief history of u . s . vote fraud . november 12 , 2004 . accessed july 6 , 2011 . 9 . 2 economist . going postal : electoral fraud be not a problem confine to distant country . may 6 . 2010 . 10 
counterpoint : voter fraud be a vastly exaggerate problem use in the united states a a smokescreen for a grow conservative strategy of disenfranchise poor and minority voter . if voter impersonation be such a grave problem , the government would prosecute violator . although the department of justice pour unprecedented resource into voter fraud prevention under the bush administration , they do not prosecute a single offender , find no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal election . 1 independent study on voter fraud as well have find strikingly little evidence of it occur in u . s . election . a study by the brennan center for justice , at the new york university school of law , find that only 0 . 0009 of the vote in the 2004 election in washington be fraudulent2 . in advance of crawford v . marion county , the brennan center file an amicus brief say that impersonation fraud be an extremely unlikely and unsubstantiated occurrence that can be prevent without require a photo id . 3 this be an incredibly small number , and one not worthy of infringe on vote right for . even in very tight election there be no evidence that vote fraud affect the outcome . this imply that in the united states , the true purpose behind these law be to resurrect jim crow era barrier to vote for poor and minority community , who be more likely to vote democrat . 1 lipton , eric , and ian urbina . in 5 year effort , scant evidence of voter fraud . new york times . april 12 , 2007 . 11 . 2 brennan center for justice . policy brief on the truth about 'voter fraud .

point : people be already require to produce valid identification for a whole range of activity that be less important than cast a vote , such a go to the gym or buy a drink . why be vote the only activity where we make it easy to cheat the system ? the claim that voter identification law be discriminatory , or that they would discourage people from vote be silly because so many aspect of everyday life require photo identification , that this would not realistically discourage people from vote . 
counterpoint : it be false to imply that present a photo id would be easy for everybody . although voting be a very important process for the health of a democracy , it be not necessarily a priority for many citizen , and so even the small barrier can be damage . the idea that everybody use photo identification all of the time be not true , especially for less well off people . not everybody take air plane or have a gym membership or own a car . ultimately , it doesn't matter how easy other aspect of life be ; what matter be the effect that voter identification law would have on the electoral process . 
point : studies have show that nearly 100 country around the world have photo identification requirement for voting , 1 so the usa would not be unique in ask it citizen to provide proof of their identity at the polling station . this also suggest that it be not too difficult to organise voting ids , a democracy much poor than the united states succeed in do so . former u . s . president jimmy carter , who be currently co chair of the commission on federal election reform , be a democrat who support voter identification law . he point out , mexico and most poor democracy in the world have be able to register and give ids to almost all their citizen . 2 indeed , it be bizarre to many election expert around the world that the united kingdom and many part of the united states do not require identification . innocent chukwuma , an election monitor who have observe election in nigeria and the uk say , of the uk system , if you have this system in nigeria , the outsider would say the potential for abuse would be massive . 3 meanwhile voter identification have be a challenge worth meeting for most of the world . even india by far the large democracy in the world create in 2009 the unique identification authority of india uidai , which will provide a national identity card to all indians , which they can use at polling station . 4 countries around the world have set the standard by prove that voter identification law be practical way of improve the integrity of election . those country that have not yet adopt the system should do so . 
counterpoint : many of the country that require voter identification card be not full democracy , and those that be have automatic and permanent registration system that provide the ids for free , which be not the case in the united states . in these system , ids can become a political weapon , with supporter of opposition party be deny vote through government manipulation of the registration system and biased check at poll station . it be also notable that such a comparable democracy a great britain do not have voter identification requirement . thus the record for voter identification system be mixed throughout the world , and the fact that these law be popular internationally do not make them a good idea .
