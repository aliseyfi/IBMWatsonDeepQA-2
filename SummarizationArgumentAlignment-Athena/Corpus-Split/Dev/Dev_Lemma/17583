point : the uk's integration with europe depend on have a similar legal foundation . every other eu member have formal superordinate legal document , such a the french constitution or german basic law . the only other european nation without a write constitution be san marino , and it government's operation be only a fraction of the uk's size . it be important to enshrine clarity in our legal code in order to engage in intra eu economic , social , and political relation , because it create a common conception of the foundation of a state's law . 
counterpoint : it be not , in actual fact , necessary to bring have a constitution similar to the rest of europe in order to be an active member of the eu . the eu membership represent a diverse range of legal foundations1 . even be it a benefit to integration , it be not worth compromise the uk's political identity for a marginal improvement in access to europe . 1 oecd , constitutions of central and eastern european countries and the baltic states , sigma papers no . 2 1995 3 
point : a write constitution act a a safeguard against extremist and politician attempt to consolidate power . in the unlikely event that a political party gain power and attempt to impose radical and tyrannical change upon the citizenry , specific constitutional limit on the power of government , and specific protection for right vital to democracy and government accountability , would provide a major obstacle . while there be certainly other avenue to establish despotism , a constitution would deprive any potential extremist of the ability to achieve it within the confines of the law . so for example the german constitution allow the german federal constitutional court to declare party unconstitutional and dissolve them1 , this be in order to prevent the rise of extremist to power in the way hitler manage it . it have twice declare party unconstitutional ; these be the socialist reich party and the communist party of germany both in 19512 . 1 paul franz , 'unconstitutional and outlawed political parties : a german american comparison' , boston college international and comparative law review , 5 51 1982 p . 51 4 2 government commits to seeking a ban of the extreme right wing national democratic party of germany npd , 1 german law journal 2000 , 5 
counterpoint : the chance of a tyrant seize control of the country via election to the house of commons be very minute indeed . if such a party be indeed popular enough to get elect , constitutional block would be of little stop to them . when hitler come to power by election , he quickly dismantle the constitutional check on his power , and do so easily because of his wide popular support . it be far wise to rely on the will of the public to oppose such dictator than to depend on a constitution . 
point : entrenching the respective right of individual and the government add clarity to issue where the boundary of the law be vague . not every time that civil right be erode be it the result of the government overstep what be previously think to be the clear boundary of the state s power ; sometimes there be a legitimate grey area regard the meeting of two right . for example , some people contest whether anti social behavioral order asbos which bar individual from certain activity or place1 or cctv camera , be a legitimate use of the coercive power of the state . under the status quo , there be no superordinate legal document to which an individual or the government can point when they dispute whether or not a law be legitimate . thus , while popular opinion can prevent the government from brazen violation of citizen right , more nuanced infringement persist with impunity . a constitution would subject controversial law to judicial review , yield a more precise ruling on their constitutionality . regardless of which way the judiciary rule , it must be back up by reason argument and interpretation of specific legal principle explicitly outline in the constitution . it be crucial to have an independent metric by which we evaluate when the government reach the limit of what it may justly legislate . 
counterpoint : a case by case approach to determine the validity of law be good than adopt a one size fit all method of say , for instance , that privacy never trumps security . if a law's worth be dispute , those who disagree can appeal to principle rather than constitutional clause when argue it merit . the metric by which law be evaluate in a democracy ought to be whether the populace accept them a just . furthermore , an explicit constitution do not get rid of such legal grey area , a even the explicit us constitution be subject to constitution battle over it interpretation . 
point : the document that currently make up the write component of the uk's informal constitution provide an accessible starting point . such ancient text and treaty a the magna carta would provide for a smooth transition from commonly accept legal principle to the formal entrenchment of those principle in the clause of a constitution . while under the status quo all law pass by parliament be consider of equal significance , there be an informal recognition by some jurist that certain law , such a the human rights act , enjoy a favored position within a hierarchy of laws1 . a write constitution would simply help to formalize this de facto hierarchy . 1 england and wales high court , 'thoburn v . sunderland city council' ewhc 195 , 2002 7 
counterpoint : these document , while an important source of historical legitimacy for current informal constitutional practice , do not represent anything approach a comprehensive or modern understanding of the right of citizen . moreover , their role would in fact be diminish from their current status a an actual part of the collection of write and unwritten idea that comprise our constitution , become instead mere historical document . 
point : a formal constitution provide the separation of power necessary to keep each part of the government in check . clearly delineate oversight power in an independent judiciary would halt parliament's attempt to overstep it mandate , and provide a mechanism to redress flagrant violation of ethic by mps . such a check on the power of the parliament would be a welcome change from the status quo of a government who may act with little accountability short of an election . similarly , explicit and independent power for the house of lords and the house of commons would codify a role to hold each other accountable . this would be similar to the way that the united states constitution work with it famous separation of power and check and balance with the exception that the executive would still be within the legislature rather than completely separate . 
counterpoint : a good political climate be one where government function properly . in a representative democracy , decision making be not intend to be majoritarian . elected official be in place to make decision on behalf of constituent , a they continue to do with matter relate to the eu . as such , a referendum be a direct rebuke to their own power . therefore mps should not hold one , even if some constituent want it . it be not the job of government to neutralize radical voice , but to offer good alternative while preserve freedom of expression . if party want to resolve the europe question , they should do so through establish political channel .
