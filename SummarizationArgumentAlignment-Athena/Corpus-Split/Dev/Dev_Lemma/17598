point : since sputnik be launch in 1957 , the space race have give rise to an infrastructure , particularly in the united states and russia , which can be exploit for economy of scale . the cost of develop shuttle and training astronaut be far cheap in cape carnarvon where the necessary equipment and skill lie to do so . furthermore , the international space station cost upwards of 100 billion , however it serve a a terminal where shuttle can thereafter be point to any corner of the universe1 . the potential therefore be to save cost by use the existence of the iss a a step stone to elsewhere . to not use fifty year of space development and technology be to render all that investment meaningless . 1 kaku , m . 2009 , july 16 the cost of space exploration . retrieved june 22 , 2011 from forbes 1 
counterpoint : if only it be true . the typical shuttle mission to the international space station cost 500 700 million . private individual , space tourist , have manage it for just 20 million a head1 . therefore , there be little in the argument that the exist space infrastructure be drive cost down . furthermore , whilst the iss have be justify a a terminal for the shuttle , the shuttle themselves have be justify a mean to reach the space shuttle ; a circular argument that offer little hope to the space explorer . moreover , despite over fifty year of investment , nasa specifically have maintain a shuttle program at the expense of new material , new fuel and innovative concepts1 . as such , the technology have not advance significantly since the original mission to the moon between 1969 and 1972 . the infrastructure , in this case , appear to have be more of a hindrance and intellectual barrier to development and cost cutting than an aid . 1 kaku , m . 2009 , july 16 the cost of space exploration . retrieved june 22 , 2011 from forbes 1 
point : the exploitation of space have directly change our world . satellites orbit the earth allow u to communicate instantaneously with people on different continent , and to broadcast to people all over the world . the global positioning system allow u to pinpoint our location anywhere in the world . weather satellite save life by give advance warning of adverse condition , and together with other scientific instrument in orbit they have help u understand our own world well . research into climate change , for example , would be almost impossible without the data provide by satellite . 
counterpoint : satellite technology have of course have a beneficial effect on our world . however , there be a huge difference between launch satellite into earth orbit , and explore space . missions to other planet , and into interstellar space , do not contribute to life on our planet . moreover , satellite be largely commercial they be launch by private company , and be maintain by the profit which they lead to . true space exploration could never be commercial , and require huge government subsidy the voyager mission alone cost just under 1 billion . this money could be much well spent elsewhere . 
point : space exploration be about more than the end , what be discover or answer , it be also about the mean , the process by which we be able to traverse the universe . in 1969 , the moon landing act a the catalyst for a whole generation of children's love for all thing space and the proliferation of young men and woman seek to become astronaut . though demand could not meet supply , many remain in the field and take up job in civil engineering , scientific research and medicine . such intangible benefit to the field of science and engineering , a john logsdon argue , cannot so easily be calculate and contrast with the concrete figure that symbolize the cost of space programs1 . 1dubner , s . j . 2008 , january 11 . is space exploration worth the cost ? a freakonomics quorum . retrieved may 19 , 2011 , from freakonomics : 4 
counterpoint : there be far cheap , more effective method of encouraging student towards career in science and engineering than space exploration program . india , not yet a flourishing space power , turn out 350 , 000 engineer a year whilst china , only a recent member of the manned space program club , produce 600 , 000 annually1 . space exploration cannot both claim to be responsible for the boom after the moon landing and yet faultless when the number drop to mediocre level , all whilst continue to spend billion of state money . 1 engardio , p . 2005 , december 27 . engineering : is the u . s . really falling ? retrieved may 19 , 2011 , from businessweek 5 
point : space exploration have also lead to many indirect benefit . the challenge and difficulty of the space program , and it ability to draw on some of the fine mind , have bring about great leap in technology . the need to reduce weight on rocket lead to miniaturization , and so to the micro chip and the modern computer . the need to produce safe but efficient power source for the apollo mission lead to the development of practical fuel cell , which be now be explore a a possible future power source for clean car . the effect of zero gravity on astronaut have substantially add to our knowledge of the working of the human body , and the ageing process . we can never know exactly which benefit will emerge from the space program in future , but we do know that we will constantly meet new obstacle in pursuit of our goal , and in overcome them will find new solution to old problem . 
counterpoint : these spin off advantage could come from any 'blue sky' project they be a result of the huge amount of money and manpower devote to the space program , give people the resource they need to solve problem , rather than a result of the program itself . for example , many of the leap forward in miniaturization be in fact the result of try to build good nuclear missile ; this be not a good reason to continue build nuclear weapon . it would be far good to devote similar resource to project with worthy goal for example cancer research , or research into renewable energy source . these too could have many spin off benefit , but would tackle real problem . 
point : mankind must always struggle to expand it horizon . the desire to know what lie beyond current knowledge , the curiosity that constantly push at the boundary of our understanding , be one of our noble characteristic . the exploration of the universe be a high ideal space truly be the final frontier . the instinct to explore be fundamentally human ; already some of our most amazing achievement have take place in space . no one can deny the sense of wonder , world wide , when for the first time a new man make star rise in the sky , or when neil armstrong first step onto the moon and utter his infamous word . space exploration speaks to that part of u which rise above the everyday . the future question be not whether human should be explore space , but , a former nasa director g . scott hubbard suggest , 'to be sure that they accomplish meaningful exploration .

counterpoint : space exploration expand the boundary of travel , but it do not expand the boundary of knowledge . knowledge be define a possess a quality beyond information , a utility . space exploration increase the amount of information we have , but have not yet provide knowledge that be applicable and useful . neil armstrong walk on the moon be a momentous moment for mankind , but that do alter the fact that there be little of practical value to earth that result from their mission . the instinct to explore do not promise an inevitable expansion of the boundary of knowledge .
