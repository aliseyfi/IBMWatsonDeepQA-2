point : migrants around the world be often see a second class citizen , and this inequality be encourage by legislation . unless migrant receive equal social and economic right , they will never be see a equal in a human sense . according to article 13 of the universal declaration of human rights , everyone have the right to leave or enter a country , as well a to move within it internal migration . this freedom of movement be often not grant under current law . 
counterpoint : migration be a problem ; not migrant right . migrant right be already protect under human right law . if a nation violate exist international human right law against a migrant , perhaps with exploitative work condition , wrongful imprisonment , seizure of property , discrimination , or violence , exist international law already adequately protect them . there be no need to expand human right law to create a separate category and separate protection for migrant . 
point : because the issue of migrant right be a global one , concern with human right and the domestic and international action of state , a u . n . convention be an appropriate solution . the u . n . be the best body to act because although the situation for migrant worker may be slightly different in each state , there be basic right that they all deserve . in addition , even if each state seek individually to protect migrant right , they might not be able to , because govern migration take coordination between state . with international legislation , state would be hold accountable for protect migrant right ; and , migrant policy and protection would be well coordinate . the international community have help the global economy adapt to rise globalization , with such body a the world trade organization , the world bank , and the international monetary fund . migration be an essential part of globalization , but there be no international body regulate the flow of worker around the world . jason deparle of the new york times write , the most personal and perilous form of movement be the most unregulated . states make and often ignore their own rule , decide who can come , how long they stay , and what right they enjoy . 1 the u . n . convention would fill this gap . 
counterpoint : even if the international community decide it want to well protect the human right of migrant , an international treaty will not necessarily advance that cause , a international law have prove to be very difficult to enforce . this will continue to be a problem into the foreseeable future . 
point : migrants face a number of challenge in integrate into a new workforce , and the opportunity to exploit them can be dangerous . these challenge include the right to join union as well a inhumane work condition . according to dr tasneem siddiqui , in 1929 , the international labour organisation ilo identify migrant worker a the most vulnerable group in the world . seventy year have elapse since then , but they still belong to that group . 1 ratifying the u . n . convention would create specific change in many country that would finally make migrant less vulnerable . for example , articles 26 and 40 provide all migrant worker the right to join and form trade union , which be ban for them in all of the arab gulf state . 2 protecting the right to unionize , allow migrant to fight for their own right in the workplace , which be the best way to ensure that they will be protect in the long term . 
counterpoint : in most democratic , developed country which be those that receive the most immigrant all people share equal right in the workplace , as long a they immigrate legally . the workplace protection in the u . n . convention that only apply to legal migrant . ratifying the convention would thus not make much positive change for migrant worker around the world . 
point : the economic protection in the u . n . convention be not only good for migrant themselves ; they benefit all country involve . migrants move to country with a lot of work available , but not enough worker . in a globalized world , migration be a market mechanism , and it be perhaps the most important aspect of globalization . 
counterpoint : migration put too heavy a burden on receive country , and it essentially mean give up on source country . it be not a mechanism of the market , but rather an unfair system that take money from taxpayer in certain country and give it to people in other country . not all aspect of migration be bad , but in addition to it workplace protection , the u . n . convention would protect the right of immigrant to send money home . this would solidify the current unfair system article 47 . remittances be a short term fix that come at a high cost for receive and source country . if migrant be not allow to send home remittance , it be possible that the most skilled worker would stay in their home country and work to rebuild the economy for the long term . 
point : migrant right be a major diplomatic issue between receive and source country , and ratify the u . n . convention would improve relation , clear the way for state to work together to solve other international problem . 
counterpoint : even seriously talk about full ratification of the u . n . convention would actually cause international tension . this be especially true in the european union , which have try to avoid the issue as much a possible . stanley pignal , of the financial times , call migration among the most sensitive topic in any of it 27 member state . 1 since it formation when it allow for internal migration , the european union have try to avoid this difficult issue . many of the protection that be propose be very unpopular there , as well a in the united states . these include particularly the right of family reunification , and any measure that clear a path to citizenship for illegal immigrant . even broach the topic of the convention would cause diplomatic fight between many of the world s lead country , who must stay friendly in order to keep a state of peace .
