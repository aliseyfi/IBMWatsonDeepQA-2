point : school child be entitle , a part of their education , to a wide range of career information , include potential role in the military . it be a school's duty to offer not only path to employment , but opportunity to engage with future employer like the military . with university place now increasingly competitive , school must remain more vigilant than ever that they do not encourage purely academic path to future career . furthermore , nationalism be a powerful factor in school curriculum worldwide , and permit military into school to talk to student be not an extension of already permitted activity like the recital of the lord's prayer in british state school or the pledge of allegiance in american school . as such , it come as little surprise that the predominant reason give for enlistment be service to country1 . if school be ask to ensure that such activity be carry out to foster national sentiment , it follow that military service should be , if not actively encourage , respect sufficiently to grant the armed service an opportunity to engage with student . 1 accardi , m . 2011 , june 15 army recruiter become a 'partner' in education retrieved june 16 , 2011 , from the huntsville times : 4 
counterpoint : the armed service have no right to preach to the youth , particularly when they be in a trusting environment like a school . to permit any organization to advertise to schoolchildren about job prospect be misguide at a time when their critical faculty be nascent and they be endow with the belief that what be teach at school be to be imbibe with little rebuttal . mandated school activity like the lord's prayer and pledge of allegiance do serve to promote nationalism , but do not do so in such a way a to threaten the life or disrupt the career path of school child . school child must be protect from organization that have the potential to put pressure on them and guilt trip them into sign away the rest of their young adult life . if their choice be to be respect , they must be leave to develop their critical faculty and then permit to use information available to the general public to make a decision . 
point : the relationship between the state and the school that it establish and fund go both way ; if school accept state funding , the state be entitle to use school a a platform for the military to appeal to future recruit . all state fund school , irrespective of location and student demographic but only high school , would be expect to accept military recruiter once a year to speak to the entire student body . the event would be a condition of further funding for the school , however there would be no limit place on a minimum number of student that need to enlist a a result . 
counterpoint : to only ask state funded school to accept military recruiter ensure that those enter the military out of school be disproportionally from state school rather than privately fund school , and therefore more likely to be middle and low class . furthermore , there should be no quid pro quo regard the funding of school , condition for further funding should be relate to the success of student and the quality of teaching , not whether the school have further the state's desire to see it military substantiate . schools should in fact protect student , not expose them annually to military recruiter who can incrementally pressurize them into a military career . 
point : militaries provide a public service that too often go unnoticed and underappreciated ; school visit raise the level of understand for the important job they do . in the uk the army publicly state that it do not directly recruit in school but do visit many each year with the aim of raise the general awareness of the armed force in society 1 they always visit by invitation of the head teacher . compared to the usa few young people have local or family connection with the military , so it be important for them to learn about the role the arm force play in our country . and in both the uk and the usa the military offer other service to school , from educational material to leadership course and team building exercise . sgt . maj . jerome dejean , of the u . s . army's 2nd recruiting brigade , describe their role a 'a partner in education 
counterpoint : however it be dress up , all the military be interested in school for be the chance to recruit student . the various educational material not always clearly mark a come from the military and course on offer be all intend to interest student in a military career . such method be dishonest and should not be allow in school ; paul mcgarr , a teacher in east london , state that 'only when recruit material give a true picture of war would he welcome them into his school'1 . if student be genuinely interested in join the military , they can go along to a recruitment centre outside school , potentially with their parent , and ask the necessary question there . 1 goff , h . 2008 , march 25 . teachers reject 'army propaganda' . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from bbc news : 3 
point : young people be not stupid they know that there be risk involve in join the military . in fact the medium usually focus on the bad news come out of afghanistan and iraq , ignore the good work of our military there . a career in the military also offer young people a lot of benefit , and it be only right that they should get to hear about those a well . as donald rumsfeld note , for some of our us student , this may be the best opportunity they have to get a college education 1 . in addition , no one be sign up on the spot in the classroom ; they always get the chance to think about it over a few month or more , and to discuss the decision carefully with parent and peer . as such , military recruitment in school should be see a no less unethical than the visit to school of policeman , for whom there be similar risk but little public conjecture . 
counterpoint : young people be not aware and be , in many case , deliberately mislead a to the risk of military service . school child , condition by modern television , film and video game a to the heroism of military service , do not often ponder the danger inherent in conflict . modern video game , in which war death be the norm and immediate 're spawning' dulls all sensitivity to death , do not serve to educate the youth about the risk but downplay them to the point of banality . studies indicate that military recruiter , whilst not actively seek to downplay risk or obscure the truth , be reluctant to volunteer information that would dissuade potential recruit 1 . 1 gee , d . 2008 , january . informed choice ? armed force recruitment practice in the united kingdom . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from informed choice : 2 
point : our military be an all volunteer force and must recruit openly to keep up it number . the army , navy and air force need well educate and motivate recruit ; a the pool of potential recruit shrink , effort to attract young people must be permit to 'intensify and diversify' 1 the alternative be a return to the conscription and national service that offer those recruit little choice . military recruitment in school permit the recruitment of only those with an interest in the armed force , allow those who wish to pursue other endeavour that opportunity . as such , visit to school be not about force militaristic propaganda on child , but about make sure that 16 18 year old know about the military a a potential career choice . after all , college representative and local employer be allow to make presentation to student , so it would be unfair to keep just the military out . if you accept that we need armed force , then you must allow them to recruit openly . 1 gee , d . 2008 , january . informed choice ? armed force recruitment practice in the united kingdom . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from informed choice : 2 
counterpoint : the need for recruit , however genuine , do not necessitate recruitment within school . there will of course be certain student who would be attract voluntarily to a role in the armed service , however these student can be reach through mean other than their school . furthermore , if the motivation of recruit be paramount , then recruit can do no more to prove their motivation than actively and independently seek out a role in the armed service , rather than have it forced upon them through visit to their school .
