point : it be a widely know fact that a large proportion of the money make from sell lottery ticket go directly to good cause and scheme run by the government to help improve the life of the people who buy the ticket in the first place . the national lottery uk be initially found on the principle of provide funding for the art , sport and heritage with funding for project that would not otherwise get off the ground , and in recent year there have be a drive by the government to return the distribution of lottery money to those causes1 . according to the official national lottery website , camelot already run the most cost efficient lottery in europe an achievement that have help the uk national lottery to generate over 26 billion for the good causes , and count 2 . this be an incredible sum of money , make possible by the fact that government endorsement allow for great awareness of the competition mean more player and more money go to charity . were the lottery to be de nationalise , there would be no guarantee of these essential donation the lottery would simply become another form of gamble which profit the organiser above all else . 
counterpoint : they don't always give as much a they say they can . a bbc news article from 2001 highlight how changeable the positive aspect of the national lottery in the uk can be1 . governmental involvement be also a drain on the possible resource that could be donate to good cause . there be no deny that the money donate be a good thing , but why should the government take a 12 cut of the profits2 on top of the running cost of the system . if the government be to be remove from the process whilst maintain the legislation that ensure the donation to good cause then that 12 which work out a a very large amount of money could also go to the good cause . if people do indeed buy their ticket in the knowledge that a lot of their money be go to help people , they would surely rather it go to those cause rather than the government . the argument for lottery base on their charitable success be of course fundamentally flaw the ticket be purchase with the aim to win the game , not to give to charity . if people be to donate the same amount of money directly to the cause they inadvertently benefit , they would have almost the same chance of win million whilst benefit the charity and scheme even more . 1 talking point . 2001 , july 2 . has the national lottery lose it appeal ? retrieved june 20 , 2011 , from bbc news : http : news . bbc . co . uk 1 hi talking_point 1410055 . stm 6 
point : governmental involvement be essential in ensure that a large proportion of the money go to help the public . for example , the london 2012 olympics will receive around 2 . 2 billion pounds1 , provide funding for building such a the main olympic stadium . without the national lottery then , the olympic games would have be much more expensive for the taxpayer , and the country would not be able to put on the spectacle it now plan to . this be just one example of how government regulation in lottery can ensure that the profit raise go where they be need people be not pay any extra to help fund project such a the olympic games , but by choose to buy a lottery ticket the government ensure that some of that money go to useful project . 1 national lottery . 2011 , june 21 . be part of london 2012 . retrieved june 20 , 2011 , from the national lottery : 7 
counterpoint : that this be a voluntary purchase do not negate it a a tax . the olympic games do not benefit the vast majority of the people who buy lottery ticket . robert k . barney point out in the new york times that the benefit be short term such an endeavor be fleet and the monument build for the spectacle in the form of stadium and sport venue shortly become little more than ghostly reminder of once glorious day 1 . andrew zimbalist point out in the same article that , montreal's 1976 olympics leave the city with 2 . 7 billion of debt that it finally pay off in 2005 there be no guarantee that the money spend from the lottery fund will in fact be economically beneficial to anyone . governmental promotion and interference in lottery can a such move money away from potentially more deserving cause to provide a temporary boost in popularity from the general public . ultimately the question come down to whether or not the money make have benefit beyond the moral issue involve in gamble . while there be positive to lottery funded project , the distribution of these fund could never be truly fair , and they will continue to benefit a minority rather than the individual that actually purchase ticket . 1 new york times . 2009 , october 2 . do olympic host cities ever win ? retrieved june 20 , 2011 , from new york times : 8 
point : there be no get round the fact that the amount of money involve in most lottery system be life change . they be the one way in which those who be of average or low income to gain immense wealth and alter their quality of life for the good . there be good documentation of how much these people's life be changed1 governmental involvement in this activity have no negative impact on the individual play the game indeed their regulation mean that the revenue generate go to more deserving cause than would happen be the lottery to be privately regulate . 1 national lottery . n . d . . where the money go . retrieved june 20 , 2011 , from the national lottery : 5 
counterpoint : of all the people who do play the lottery , a tiny minority ever win a life change sum of money . the system encourage a culture in which people assume that they can gain the reward of wealth and success without actually be successful , and of course in the vast majority of case this be utterly misguide . studies have also show that people who be , or at least feel that they be less well off be far more likely to play lotteries1 they therefore create a culture of false hope among poor people , and also encourage them to waste what little money they have on something that be of no use to them . government promotion of such a socially selective form of tax be a such unacceptable . 1 levin , s . 2008 , july 25 . poverty lead to play lottery . retrieved june 21 , 2011 , from the pittsburgh post gazette : 13 
point : if there exist a mechanism , like the national lottery , whereby a government can raise it revenue outside of have to directly tax it population , it be obligate to do so . direct taxation be a burden on the population , reduce discretionary spending ; therefore government should constantly be seek to placate it population by reduce the proportion of state revenue that come from direct taxation . a study by the north american association of state and provincial lotteries find that lottery sale raise 52 . 6 billion for state in 20051 . if the state's obligation be to look after the general interest of it population , which lie in low direct tax rate a a proportion of total revenue , such a lucrative revenue stream cannot be ignore at the expense of maintain direct tax rate . 
counterpoint : governments should not seek alternative revenue stream that permit a circumvention of the traditional , fairer direct tax method . direct taxation ensure , generally , that those able to pay proportionally more tax , do so . to reduce the proportion of government or state revenue that come from such method , in favour of a national lottery , mean that those less able to pay be thereafter contribute a great percentage of overall government revenue than they should be in an equitable system . therefore , a national lottery do not serve anyone's interest but the state , for they can claim to be reduce direct tax on all tax band , however in effect they be merely ask the less well off to contribute proportionally more to the state coffer . even if everyone spend the same on a lottery ticket each week , the fact that the majority of the population lie in the middle to lower tax bracket mean that they thereafter be contribute more than they should be .
