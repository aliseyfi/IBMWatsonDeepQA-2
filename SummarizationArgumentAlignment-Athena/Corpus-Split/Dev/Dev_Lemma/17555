point : mandatory sentence law prevent judge from take into consideration aggravating and mitigating circumstance when impose punishment . this be because by nature , fix penalty must ignore whether mandatory sentence have beneficial or deleterious effect on the victim and on the family and associate of the defendant 1 . at time , this result in great injury to society than a more lenient alternative . instead sentence should be much more flexible to take into account all the different circumstance of a case and the nature of the crime . 
counterpoint : by enforce a strict set of guideline for sentence , mandatory penalty ensure that the sympathy of an individual judge cannot impede the fair enforcement of the law by motivate him to impose an overly lenient punishment . these statute make decision making more transparent and predictable . . . sentence decision lack a coherent structure . . . in the past , judge sentence decision be not subject to rule , and the lack of rule could result in unfair and unequal treatment of offender 1 . 
point : by mandate extraordinarily long sentence , three strike law contribute to the problem of overcrowd in prison . while inmate who have receive life sentence under such statute be permanently remove from society , study show that overcrowd and poorly regulate prison tend to have high rate of rape andsexual violence 1 . those inmate who have receive light sentence be , furthermore , less likely to receive access to proper rehabilitative program , to such an extent that study have demonstrate a correlation between overcrowd and increased recidivism . 1 
counterpoint : lengthy sentence for repeat offender be credit with help to reduce crime . though mandatory minimum sentencing law generally do result in those convict spending more time behind bar , any contribute effect this trend would have on overcrowd in prison be mitigate by the decrease in overall crime rate that such policy tend to produce . in particular , california s three strike legislation reduce felony arrest rate among the class of criminal with two strike by 15 20 per year with some estimate as high a 30 . . . the two strike provision of the law deters on the order of . . . 12 , 712 crime per year 1 . 
point : three strike law mandate that court impose upon offender a lengthy minimum sentence upon conviction of a third offense . in california , the first two strike must be consider serious or violent , but the mandatory minimum sentence of 25 year may be impose upon conviction of any third felony offense . in ewing v . california 2003 , a four time felon receive the mandatory minimum sentence upon conviction of steal three golf club with a combined total value of less than 1 , 200 . regardless of how severe a view one take of recidivism , such a punishment be clearly excessive and grossly disproportionate to the current offense . allowing mandatory minimum sentence to be apply in case like this undermine the integrity of the criminal justice system . 
counterpoint : recidivists should receive increasingly severe sentence in order to protect the general public it be not imprisonment that undermine the integrity of the criminal justice system , but the failure of the system to keep the public safe . research have find that habitual adult offender commit a large percentage of crime , and that a majority of inmate who be release from prison be likely to reoffend within a short period of time 1 . three strike law protect citizen from incorrigible offender by incorporate past behaviour into the sentencing equation .
