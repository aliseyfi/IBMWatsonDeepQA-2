point : current policy be obviously not work . increased life expectancy and badly think out pension provision mean that an increase number of old people fall into poverty . in a recent survey in the uk 57 of people interview be concern that the pension of their elderly relative would not be sufficient to sustain them for the rest of their lives1 . the elderly need to be provide for , and a the state be struggle , child must step forward and fill this void . 
counterpoint : people be already be expect to pay high contribution towards their pension , retire later and accept low payouts , imply that child be legally responsible for their parent past adulthood would far suggest that the failure of the state pension scheme be somehow acceptable the key point of pension change can be view at 'spending review' bbc news . 
point : rather than adopt a 'right now' attitude to government policy on tax and spending , individual would be more likely to think about the long term consequence of government policy know that their future be directly tie to the financial future of their child . this short term thinking have become a serious problem meaning there be big hole in pension fund and the government may not have enough to pay for elderly care in the future . for example sir derek wanless have warn that the amount spend by government , individual and organization in britain on care for the sick and disable elderly will increase from 10 billion a year to 20 billion a year by 2026 . cost of care for the elderly set to double , templeton therefore voter would support financially sensible policy that avoid increase deficit and national debt . 
counterpoint : there be no evidence to suggest that people would vote for more 'financially sensible policies' if they think the provision of their care be tie up with their children's financial future . the decision to support decision that may prove disadvantageous in the long run come about with the sense of urgency in the current situation something that would not be change dramatically whether or not this law be introduce . if anything this law could encourage people to become neglectful in their own saving under the assumption that they will be take care of should thing to go wrong . personal debt would increase and the culture of spend now , pay later would be reinforce . 
point : everybody should have a responsibility to each other . the elderly , a a social group , have be largely neglect by society . by start at grass root , legalize the responsibility of the young to look after the old , would benefit society in general and promote the respect of the elderly . elderly people be equal citizen with equal right , they deserve to have enough money for a secure and decent life in retirement with access to the health and social care that they need . yet more and more old people be die each year of malnutrition or freeze to death in their home : over the last five year there have be an increase in winter death by 25 , 000 every year this be unacceptable . 1 although commitment to the right of old people do exist , for example the madrid international plan of action on ageing , they be not legally bind , more need to be do to ensure that the care of the elderly be adopt a a legal priority by governments2and by whole community ; this law would be the first step in that process . 
counterpoint : legalizing the need to care for the elderly may have the opposite effect effect it pit the young and old against one another , draw legal distinction and assume the two s interest be oppose . it could too easily breed scorn and resentment from the young generation . rather than have a moral obligation towards parent that one love and who have provide for you , they will simply become a legal burden . this would ultimately damage the relationship between parent and child at a time when role reversal make the relationship strain anyway see caring for elderly parents , laterlife and savundranayagam , a dimensional analysis . 
point : this law would give parent a great stake in their child's education and development . rather than be concern with save for late life they will want to think about the future and long term prospect of their child . similarly a child would be legally responsible for the well be of their parent past adulthood , encourage child to think more carefully about the decision they make in regard to care . the stark figure that between 2005 and 2009 , 667 elderly people die from dehydration in care home and 157 died of malnutrition1 suggest that child neglect their parent in term of ensure they be place in adequate care . passing a law would ensure that this no long happens and family tie between generation would be strengthen . 
counterpoint : there be fundamental danger in monetarising a relationship between child and parent . from young a child would be make to feel responsible for their parent a they be reduce to a mere investment . furthermore this financial way of thinking may see a parent push their child down a path simply because it be financially rewarding . the neglect of the elderly in society be due to an increase distancing between generation and place responsibility of the sick and age onto the state a social and cultural change that a law cannot simply undo 1 . 
point : the law would legislate so that it be fair to all . when look at case the court would inevitably make child pay in proportion to their mean so the rich have to pay more than the poor , but the state could also help those who be too poor to support their parent . the policy will therefore aid the poor member of society . parents who be not well off and will spend most of their income care for their child will be one most at risk of suffer from poverty in their old age . this law would ensure that these people be care for adequately . moreover , judicial oversight can be use to make sure the application of the law be fair , that a parent can t make a claim if they have abandon , neglect or abuse their child , or if the child themselves be too poor to support the elderly parent . 
counterpoint : in practice this will never work , many parent would be unwilling to sue their own child for support , or in many case even admit that they need the support . this policy will disproportionately hurt poor family and it will widen the social gap . while rich parent will be able to afford raise their child in comfort , give them the best opportunity , while also save money for their retirement , poor family will end up saddle their child with the duty to care for elderly parent , thus prevent them from accrue wealth , have more disposable income that they could invest or spend more money on their own children's education . this will trap wealth within rich family and will mean poor family will find it hard to break out of poverty .
