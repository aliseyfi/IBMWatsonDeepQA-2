point : canada already benefit from have the world's big market next door and under nafta this benefit be expand immensely . under nafta , between 1994 and 2003 , canada's economy grow at 3 . 6 annually , and employment have risen1 . nafta have also help equalize agricultural flow between the us and canada . nafta have give canada an advantage in the us , the world's big market , as well a zero tariff access to a wide variety of american products2 . 
counterpoint : while canada have experience some economic benefit due to nafta , these benefit do not outweigh the harm for north america overall . furthermore , a the con discuss below , canada have struggle to reconcile it environmental regulation with nafta , thereby hurt it environmentally , if not economically . 
point : the increase in low cost mexican good have benefit us consumers1 , thereby improve the standard of living for work americans . us export have increase by 104 billion2 , thereby bolster manufacturing . while some job have be lose due to nafta , these have be primarily low skill job ; reduce the number of low skill job in the economy allow the us to concentrate on more profitable , white collar job . and even these low skilled worker benefit from have to pay less for their good . 
counterpoint : nafta's harmful effect on american industry outweigh it benefit . americans be not help by low price if they lose their job and have no money . furthermore , evidence show the american job lose through nafta be largely high wage manufacturing job , thereby exacerbate income inequality . 
point : trade liberalization have cause social upheaval that create great demand for genuine democracy within mexico1 . the election of 1994 be consider to be the first free election in the modern history of mexico2 . in 2000 , the first opposition president not a member of the institutional revolution party since 1929 be elected3 . many scholar credit the liberalized economic environment foster by nafta for this political development towards a genuine democracy4 . 
counterpoint : there be little reason to believe that nafta be a key agent in mexican political change . in the time after nafta be sign , mexico also experience an economic crisis link to a currency collapse1 . its president flee the country on corruption charge and drug relate corruption continue to plague the country . mexico have have both good and bad political and economic experience since the implementation of nafta , and it be impossible to say that nafta cause the freer election in 1994 and therefore have be overall beneficial for mexico . 
point : by expand their free trade region to the entire continent , canada , the us , and mexico have demonstrate the plausibility of great international cooperation . although nafta be not on the scale of the eu , it similarly demonstrate the ability of nation to work together for mutual benefit , thereby increase international cooperation . nafta help create a secure north american continent where none of the state need be worry about the other member in much the same way a the european union do in europe . competition and potentially war be prevent through great trade integration a be show by european integration since the second world war . 
counterpoint : if anything , nafta have harm international cooperation by damage the party involve . due to the continental free trade agreement , mexican farmer have lose their livelihood , american manufacturer have be lay off , environmental harm have increase , and the agreement have fail to create the job stimulus it promise . we can only hope that nafta be not a typical example of international cooperation , for such would not bode well for the international community .
