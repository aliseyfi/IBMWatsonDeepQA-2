point : a variety of international study have find that increase the cost of alcohol reduce it consumption , along with the health and social harm associate with it . 
counterpoint : those who wish to drink heavily for a cheap price will turn to alternative . many of them will probably decide to buy black market alcohol . russia be the example of a failed minimum price policy . when the price rise people start to brew their own alcohol1 . the statistical evidence for raise price lower drink consumption be a best mixed2 . 
point : it be the government's responsibility to promote the health and wellbeing of it citizen . taxpayers be force to pay for the cost of alcohol relate ill health and anti social behavior . this be a waste of money that be be spend on other government priority . this be an effective policy to deal with this issue . free market suffer from externality cost such a pollution that be create by only a few actor , but which everyone have to pay . so our whole society pay for the harm result from the ridiculously cheap alcohol associate with below cost marketing and aggressive promotion . families suffer terribly when a husband , mother or son be an alcoholic or violent drinker . residents suffer from the anti social behavior and crime associate with binge drinking . business lose million of productive day work each year ; accord to the institute of alcoholic studies , each day around 200 , 000 british worker turn up to work hung over from the night before . high proportion of hung over worker report problem such a lack of concentration and the inability to work at normal pace . in 2001 there be an attributable 1 . 2 billion pound attribute to the loss in economy in the uk , base only on alcohol attribute absence from work 1 . all of this impact the society , by lose overall economic wealth through loss of productivity and have to pour money to alcoholic health treatment . if these individual in society do not want to stop with their activity , they should at least give back financially . in the state of washington , we see that the state's beer , soda and bottle water tax give the state 122 million in revenue in 2009 , help to close a 2 . 8 billion deficit . california could raise around 1 . 4 billion a year with a marijuana tax 2 . 
counterpoint : the government be supposedly protect the vulnerable with this policy . yet they should consider the individual who be consider vulnerable : alcoholic and young people . 
point : this measure will be good for public house and bar license premise , which have be struggle in recent year in comparison to supermarket and discount retailer off license that can sell alcohol much more cheaply . this be because they do not have the same overhead and can take advantage of economy of scale . pubs often sell alcohol at rate that would be high than any minimum price . clubs and pub which offer happy hour and other irresponsible drink deal would be the only one affect by this proposal1 . 
counterpoint : this argument be hypothetical but do not seem plausible . pubs provide a specific atmosphere and service . yet they be not compete well with alternative source of alcohol . that suggest that their service be desire infrequently or in some case not at all . raising price be not likely to save such establishment , since any minimum price could not make alcohol from off license more expensive than a pub at most it could make them equally a costly . since individual be not willing to pay for the specific service of a pub , it's not clear why individual would not just continue to avoid them and pay more for off license alcohol .
