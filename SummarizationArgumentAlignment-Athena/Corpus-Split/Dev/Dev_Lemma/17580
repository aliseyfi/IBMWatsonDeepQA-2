point : integration be something that be already happen due to the existence of creoles . bryson 1991 state that , according to dr loreto todd of leeds university , the world have sixty one creole languages that be a mix of two different one , such a the many different pidgins speak around the world speak by up to 200 million people . creole language be the ultimate form of language integration , and most would argue that this isn't language death , and can in fact enhance the culture through the new language . 
counterpoint : creoles aren't an example of language integration . creoles be simply a natural shift in the language , and not necessarily a complete overhaul and integration , for example english itself become 'frenchified' after the norman conquest , but it be still far remove from the french language we know today . 
point : the world be become increasingly more and more globalised and a common language of communication be necessary to help this continue . countries be more interdependent than ever and with the advance that we have see in technology in the last few decade , communication be instantaneous . for u to be able to effectively communicate , especially within field such a international trade and economics , as well a diplomacy , a common working language be key . mcdonalds for example have almost thirty three thousand branch in almost every country in the world1 within such big global company communication be essential . not surprisingly these multi national company increasingly opt for english a their corporate language regardless of where the company originally come from , for example japanese base rakuten be to make english it company language from 20122 . 1 dean praetorius , subway passes mcdonald's to become the world's largest restaurant chain , the huffington post , 7th march 2011 , 1 2 ulara nakagawa , unconventional rakuten , the diplomat , 12th may 2011 2 
counterpoint : the world today demonstrate that globalisation can occur even without a global language . mcdonalds have obviously not be hinder by have to speak different language in different country . as a company that employ people on low wage and be base on a franchise system there be no need for employee to be able to speak a global language to be able to serve their local customer . meanwhile in international relation , speak a guest country's language be generally see a good manner ; even from tourist . 
point : the united nations already have universal education high up the priority list . the second millennium development goal be to achieve universal primary education and to 'ensure that , by 2015 , child everywhere , boy and girl alike , will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling' . universal schooling be the key to teach a global language . this do not mean that child will be force to learn a global language , but because of the utility of the language most will want to when they be give the opportunity . the global spread of english encourages non native speaker to learn a second language ; english . without english , a second language would only slightly increase the number of people you could communicate with . with english or , if it ever take off , esperanto ! there be a strong incentive to learn the single language that will dramatically improve your ability to communicate with others around the world . 
counterpoint : it will be difficult and impractical to make everyone learn the same language . picking just one language disadvantage those whose language be replace especially if they be unable or unwilling to use the new language . it would be extremely practically difficult and expensive to teach everyone the new language , especially when literacy level , even in their own language be very low in some country . those without good enough language skill may find it hard to get a job at all , thereby disadvantage those without access to good education , something that be see in country where knowledge of english be become essential , such a spain . 
point : poetry and other significant literary work could be translate into english so that everyone can enjoy them . this would be equally true of scientific and technical information as well a teach staff and institution . most popular classical work be translate into other language without loss of mean e . g . poem of robert burns from the original scots into english . and why would we purposely want to make it difficult for people to understand each other ? surely understanding each other be more important than learn about their culture but not be able to converse whatsoever . this would have immense benefit for science a researcher all over the world would be able to understand each other's work . 
counterpoint : translation be not always successful in preserve idea or literary construction mean cultural diversity may be lose . translating work into english could be see a another form of cultural genocide . this be particularly true of poetry the work of shakespeare for example , where local dialect and word sound be essential to the understanding of the piece . however many new work a global language would provide access to , true appreciation be best gain from study them in the language in which they be write . by reduce the use of other language we risk cut people off from historical document and literature in their old language , work which often carry emotional or religious significance . understanding of some language may be lose altogether if they be not spoken every day . 
point : translation be very expensive , but while there be no common language also necessary . all sort of document have to be translate into several language even within country , for example uk councils provide information on their activity in the major minority language within their area . with a global language this will be cheap and quick as well a reduce the potential for misunderstanding . the european union be the big example of this with all document need to be translate into every member state's language . the total bill for the eu in translation fee be 800 million in 2004 , that's 2 per citizen1 . 
counterpoint : not translate cause it own problem . meaning be give to word by their cultural context rather than a dictionary definition . this mean people from different culture may use the same word to mean different thing in different context , even when speak the same language . crucial cultural distinction maybe overlook if translation be no longer consider . it would also be much more expensive to create a new language , and to make everyone learn it e . g . esperanto , and international organization seem work perfectly fine with translating . misunderstanding from have different meaning from the same word would be as great a the translation cost .
