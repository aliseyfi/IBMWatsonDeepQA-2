point : under fptp , party representative can focus on the concern of 30 or so of citizen on whose vote they rely on for re election . this result in tribal politics . av , in force mps to gain 50 of vote , force them to consider those outside their core voter . 
counterpoint : av do little to empower voter a they must still choose between the main political party . each party choose a candidate who be then appoint to impose upon an area . voters who like the party but dislike the candidate face a difficult decision . 
point : the current fptp system be undemocratic ; currently a majority government can be create with a minority of the vote , because mps be elect with less than 50 of the vote , lend their decision little legitimacy . according to figure from the electoral reform society , 434 mps of 650 receive less than 50 per cent of the vote at the 2010 general election1 which mean the majority of their constituent do not vote for them . av ensure that elect representative have the support the majority of their candidate because they have to get more than 50 of the vote . this give a strong democratic mandate to those who be elect . 
counterpoint : the alternative vote often prevent the most popular candidate from win . in a race with several contender , one may be far more popular with the voter than any other , gain perhaps 40 of first preference vote while the next candidate might be 20 behind them . but quite often a less popular candidate be eliminate , their second and low preference vote don't go to the lead contender and the eventual winner end up be an inoffensive centrist who be few citizens' first choice . 1 
point : under the fptp electoral system , supporter of minority party either waste their vote to support their ideal , or decide which of the lead party they dislike lease and vote accordingly . research report by the british academy indicate that 15 of people vote for a party other than their most prefer in the 2005 general election . 1 this leave voter unhappy at have to vote for the less of two evil . this also perpetuate the tradition two party politics in the uk , a it make it hard for a third party to gain enough vote to break through nationally . under av there would be no technical reason for vote tactically for your most preferred candidate . 2 av allow voter to express their preference honestly , a their first preference vote can be a protest vote for a minority party ; when that be inevitably eliminate , their mainstream vote will still contribute to the result . av encourage positive voting . 
counterpoint : with av the old game of tactical voting be not put away , it just have new rule . 1 av do eliminate tactical voting a voter who wish to maximise the impact of their preference must second guess each other . they will have to rank all the party on their card in an order which prevent those party they dislike most from get elect . 
point : unlike other proportional representation system the alternative vote be easy to implement when change from first past the post . this be because av do not represent a very large change in term of how the voting system would work . av keep the same constituency so mps and candidate would be compete for the same vote they have always do . voters would remain in the same constituency so prevent any confusion that would be involve in a fully proportional system . the relative small change and therefore the ease to implement can be show by the relatively small change have the 2010 general election be fight under av . labour would have win ten few seat , the conservatives twenty three less and liberal democrats thirty two more . 1 
counterpoint : it be not change in the constituency that make av difficult to implement , it be the voter education that be necessary when change the system . more than a third of voter believe that av be hard to understand and if the voter do not understand the system the system will not work . 1 
point : nobody dispute the fact that extreme right and leave party should be allow representation if they can gain the support of a large enough section of the vote public . irrespective of their view , party must all be give an equal chance of representation . 'better' democracy must include extremism . however , av make it much less likely that extremist party will be elect , a they be unlikely to get the required 50 support , instead of the 25 30 they currently need if support for oppose party be split . 
counterpoint : baroness warsi , co chairman of the conservative party , give a speech on march 30th which sum up the no campaign s perspective on av . she say that under av , voter would be able to register a protest vote without consider the electoral implication and then transfer back to a mainstream party . this mean more people back fringe party because they feel they can .
