point : law abide state like the united states that have yet to ratify the icc should have nothing to fear if they behave lawfully . the prosecutor of the icc be only concerned with the most grave offence and it defy belief that the us would approve a strategy of genocide or systematic mass violation of human right that could attract the jurisdiction of the icc . further , the discretion of the prosecutor be not unchecked . the statute require that the approval of three judge sit in a pre trial chamber be obtain before an arrest warrant can be issue or proceeding initiate . moreover , there be no harm to the interest of the us in be subject to a mere preliminary investigation . in fact , it be preferable that spurious accusation be briefly examine and show to be baseless , than that these accusation be allow to raise doubt about the credibility of a state's action and the impartiality of the tribunal in question . the us acceptance of the jurisdiction of the prosecutor of the icty be evident ; the us troop form part of the kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo could equally be subject to investigation and prosecution by the icty . the us be prepare for it force to operate under the scrutiny of the icty since it reasonably do not expect it member to commit the very crimes they be deploy to prevent . 
counterpoint : the icc's ability to prosecute war criminal be both overstated and simplistic . it have no force of it own , and must rely on it member state to hand over criminal want for prosecution . this lead to case like that of serbia , where want war criminal like ratko mladic be believe to have be hide with the complicity of the regime until finally hand over in 2011 . the absence of a force or any coercive mean to bring suspect to trial also lead to situation like that in libya , whereby colonel gaddafi be want by the icc but the prosecution's case be germane if he manage his grip on power . furthermore , it rely on external funding to operate , and can only sustain case so long a financial support exist to see them through . 
point : the icc offer a multilateral mean by which international law can be bring to bear on the perpetrator of war crime . as amnesty international argue , 'the icc ensure that those who commit serious human right violation be hold accountable . justice help promote last peace , enable victim to rebuild their life and send a strong message that perpetrator of serious international crime will not go unpunished' . furthermore , and for the first time , the icc have the power to order a criminal to pay reparation to a victim who have suffer a a result of their crime . such reparation may include restitution , indemnification and rehabilitation . judges be able to order such reparation whether the victim have be able to apply for them or not . though reparation will often not be sufficient on their own for last peace , they be a step in the right direction and only make possible by the establishment of the icc . 
counterpoint : the icc do not offer last peace to victim , but can instead re open old wound . 'it be by no mean clear that 'justice' as define by the court and prosecutor be always consistent with the attainable political resolution of serious political and military disputes' argue john bolton . the icc deal with individual criminal and specific crime in a vacuum , it be unable to appreciate the , albeit paradoxical , notion that it may be in the best interest of the resolution of conflict for the perpetrator to go unpunished and victim to forego reparation . 'circumstances differ , and circumstance matter'1 the icc in offer last peace to victim of war crime be unable to weigh the circumstance in the manner of an ad hoc tribunal tailor to the specific conflict . 
point : upon sign the rome statute in 1996 , u . n . secretary general kofi annan state that 'the establishment of the court be still a gift of hope to future generation , and a giant step forward in the march towards universal human right and the rule of law'1 . such statement demonstrate the impact the court could potentially have , a a body that simultaneously cherish sovereignty and protect national court whilst offer a mean by which criminal in state unable or unwilling to prosecute will still be bring to justice . as the natural and permanent heir to the process start at nuremberg in the wake of world war ii2 , the icc ensure that the reach of law be now universal ; war criminal , either in national or international court , will be force to trial a a result of the principle of universal jurisdiction1 . the deterrent effect of such a court be obvious and a warning to those who felt they be operate in anarchic legal environment . 
counterpoint : the us hold a unique position in the fabric of the protection of international peace and security . whilst it might be appropriate for other states to consent to the jurisdiction of the icc , these states do not bear the responsibility and attendant risk behold to the 200 , 000 us troop in continuous forward deployment . the armed force of the us that have respond to three hundred per cent more contingency situation during the previous decade than during the whole of the cold war . it be clear that the world more than ever look to the us for it safety . furthermore , the military dominance of the us increase the likelihood of prosecution . when rogue regime be incapable of defeat the us by any military mean , they be likely to resort to 'asymmetric challenges' to their force . challenging the authority of the us in the icc will be more damaging to us interest and willingness to intervene than any conventional military opposition . the indispensable nation must therefore be permit to dispense with the icc .
