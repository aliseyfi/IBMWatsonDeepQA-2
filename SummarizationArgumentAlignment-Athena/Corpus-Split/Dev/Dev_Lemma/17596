point : the status quo deny the english their own distinctive political identity . the devolution settlement acknowledge that the political preference and cultural identity of the scottish , welsh and english people be sufficiently different to warrant the creation of separate scottish and welsh legislature . if political preference be the same between these nation , there would be no problem with have one central parliament . proponents of devolution must , therefore , believe that such difference exist . however , have do the scottish and welsh the service of allow them to elect representative of their political preference , the uk deny this right to the english , force them to continue to be subject to the political preference of the scottish and welsh , who can vote in westminster election . this process be clearly unfair , and generate an inequality within the uk . this be exemplify by the fact that in the 2005 general elections , a plurality of english vote be cast in favour of the conservative party , 35 . 7 compare to labour's 35 . 4 1 but a labour government be elect , partly on the back of the heavily labour dominate scottish and welsh vote . 1 election 2005 , 'results england' bbc news , 10 may 2005 1 , access 28 august 2011 
counterpoint : the devolution settlement be design with english dominance in mind . the reason why the scottish and welsh desire autonomy from westminster be against a historical backdrop of oppression by the english , and because of a remain fact that the english dominate proceeding at westminster . this be for three reason : 1 the location of the uk parliament in london , which mean that all mps be resident of england ; 2 the population of england compare to scotland and wales , guarantee it a substantial majority of seat ; and 3 the economic power of england within the uk , particularly that of london . the necessitated independent representative body for scotland and wales , whose political identity be suppress before devolution . post devolution , no such problem exists for england it remain the dominant nation within the uk parliament , and have little difficulty exert it influence over uk politics indeed it continue to exert more influence over scotland through sewell motion than the scottish parliament do . the statistic about the 2005 general election be a diversion , since labour would still have win a majority of seat in england , despite not have a plurality of vote owe to the first past the post electoral system . in addition to this , it be clear that the english themselves be relatively uninterested in devolution and the issue bring about by the west lothian question . 1 in the early 21st century the main preference of english constituency be for the status quo of government by the uk parliament in westminster . 2 
point : there be an issue with accountability under the status quo . around 20 of the mps elect to parliament be elect from constituency outside of england , and these mps all get to vote on issue which affect only england . most mps can be hold to account for their decision by their local constituent , who can lobby their mps by write to them , attend local surgery meeting with the mps or by switch their vote at the next election . such scrutiny and accountability take place under the assumption that when the mp vote , she do so in the interest of her constituent , and they may protest if she do not vote in their interest . however , for the 20 of parliament whose constituent be totally unaffected by the outcome of the vote , no accountability can be expect . no scottish or welsh constituent will write to their local mp , or change the way they vote , base on their mp's voting record on matter which cannot affect them . as such , a fifth of mps stay in their job without fear of public scrutiny , and know that the likelihood of their be re elect be divorce from their voting record in parliament . an english parliament would solve this problem , by create a situation in which all politician vote only on those issue that may affect their constituent . politicians , such a malcolm rifkind , have suggest that an english parliament , or in this case grand committee , would increase the accountability of mps thus make the system much fairer1 . 1 rifkind , malcolm , 'be fair , give devolution to england' , the times , nov . 4th 2007 4 , access 27th june 2011 
counterpoint : to say that the 'west lothian question' hinders accountability be to misunderstand how the electorate vote . general election be not , a the proposition case require , decide upon by the local electorate's satisfaction with their mp . they be , effectively , vote in along party line , with the electorate voting for the party they prefer , not the candidate . as a result , it be nonsense to believe that politician be hold to account by local lobbying effort , letter to mps and constituency surgery . they be hold to account by medium scrutiny , by the effect of the central government's policy on people's life , and by parliamentary committee and the opposition . the introduction of an english parliament would , in fact , reduce the quality of policy making and accountability by spread a scarce number of talented policy maker and politician over a great number of legislative body and parliamentary committee . it be good that the westminster parliament concentrate the most successful political operator in one organisation , which can develop good policy and effectively hold the government to account . good policy make for england by westminster can then be recommend to the scottish parliament , a procedure know a a sewell motion . 
point : an english parliament be require to overcome a democratic deficit . in the status quo , scottish and welsh mps get to vote on issue that do not affect their constituent , but may be pivotal in get through legislation that affect the english . this in fact happen with the vote on university top up fee : top up fee be implement in england despite a majority of english mps vote against introduce them . they be pass only because scottish mps vote with the government , even though the scottish parliament have already vote not to introduce them for scottish university . here we have a clear example of the representative of english citizen vote down a proposal , but the policy be implement on the english against their will because of the vote of outsider . this totally undermine the democratic principle of self rule and accord to paul kingsworth these policy be , therefore , flaw . the policy be not , in many case , representative of the public's wish in the geographical area they be to be implemented1 . democracy exist so that a population can decide for itself what law it live under the absence of an english parliament deny the english this right to decide for themselves , because sometimes the scots and welsh decide for them . 2 
counterpoint : the 'west lothian question' create no more problem than any other aspect of a system of representative democracy . it be simply a feature of democracy that large institution make decision which don't affect all of the population , and yet we have no problem with everyone get a say in those matter . parliament make policy on education and health , for example , despite some people not be affect by those decision . the fact that the scottish and welsh voter have an influence over english affair be no more undemocratic than some english people get to have a say on matter that will affect other english people . in order to make the claim that the english be deny a right to self rule because of the 'west lothian question' , one would have to claim that there be some special quality englishness that make english people qualify to make decision on behalf of one another , but disqualify the scots from make such decision . such a quality clearly do not exist a representative of berwick upon tweed be no more able to look after the interest of someone from cornwall than a representative of dumfries . some also believe that that an english parliament would cause further friction between conflict wish and policy and would , eventually , cause britain to act undemocratically . 1 
point : it be problematic that england , scotland and wales elect politician to the same legislature with differ mandate . a mandate be a commission give to a government and it policy or an elect representative and his policy through an electoral victory . the westminster parliament can only affect the scottish and welsh through foreign policy , therefore , scottish and welsh mps be elect by their constituent with a mandate to enact policy in area of foreign policy . meanwhile , english politician have a mandate to enact both foreign and domestic policy , since their electorate vote them in to carry out these function . this mean that one set of mps be not act under an electoral mandate when they vote in parliament and , consequently , their decision lack the legitimacy of english mps . separating the function of foreign and domestic policy into two separate parliament would make the mandate of elected politician clear , and enable all mps to vote with a consistent level of legitimacy1 . 
counterpoint : again , the proposition's case rest on anunrealistic view of what constitute a political mandate . the electorate do not elect politician with a specific set of policy in mind , but rather treat the general election a a referendum on the government . since the central government still control aspect of scottish and welsh life through macroeconomic and foreign policy decision and sewell motion , it be appropriate that scottish and welsh voter should have a say in who sit in that government . it be not the case that an english parliament would not affect the scottish and welsh at all economic movement and the free movement of people within the uk , overlap public body and administration , and the political and economic impact of england on the rest of the uk would all contribute to the effect of the english parliament on scotland and wales . 1 thus , an effective referendum on the government of england be one in which scotland and wales should have a say .
