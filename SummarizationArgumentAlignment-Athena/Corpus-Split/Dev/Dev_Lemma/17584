point : with the development of digital video recorders dvrs and more generally the internet people have come to no longer simply consume medium in a linear fashion , they take a more fragmented approach . in news consumption people no longer want to simply have one newspaper with a vast array of topic inside . they want to pick and choose which story and column they consume , people now prefer to pull the content they want rather than have it push on them . in a digital world the news consumer can become their own editor and no long need to rely entirely on old hierarchical structure . 
counterpoint : the positive side of a newspaper is the fact you have a vast array of topic , which you would not usually consume . it broaden the mind a you may often come across story you never usually take notice of . this open up a whole new world of interest , whereas if people be give the role of editor they would most likely simply choose to read what already interest them and their channel of perception will become narrower . in addition to this , newspaper be not necessarily linear . they do not have to be read in a linear fashion , people can choose which stories they wish to read and reject those they do not . newspapers be far more flexible than they be generally portray 1 . modern newspaper have adapt their design to increase their consumption by the public . 
point : in an interconnected global world whereby technology allow u within second to communicate across the globe in a variety of form the newspaper medium become obsolete . in the time it take to write , edit , print and distribute a newspaper the event be cover may very well have change , when we have the technology to overcome this problem it seem unlikely that newspaper will continue to exist because who want to read old news ? an example of newspaper not be able to adapt to change event can be see with the killing of osama bin laden on 2nd may 2011 , the story break too late for the morning newspaper in the uk to be able to change their page to include the story , it be then subsequently report a day late on the 3rd may . 1 
counterpoint : it be true that newspaper cannot adapt as quickly a other type of medium to break news event , however there be advantage to have slow news . reporting news event immediately a they happen often lead to speculation a the big picture be often unknown by the journalist , therefore have time to digest the give event can allow for more accurate and detailed reporting rather than broadcast fact which may not be immediately confirmable , a long time before publication then be likely to result in more accurate , less speculative information . for example many tv news outlet be report , when the first plane to hit the world trade center on the 11th september , that it be an unfortunate accident . it of course later emerge to be the work of terrorist . 
point : newspapers have no place in the modern medium landscape a they be not environmentally friendly , they be a waste of paper when there be many other my efficient way in which news can be disseminate . for example a single annual subscription to the new york times roughly generate 520lb of waste which equate to approximately 4 . 25 tree be cut down per reader per year 2 , when you take into account all the other publication that print throughout the world this equate to a lot of wastage of increasingly scarce natural resource which could be avoid . using digital tool to distribute news be more efficient a you only use resource when the content be actually require rather than the print medium method in which the product be print when it may not be necessarily purchase and consume . 
counterpoint : newspapers do still have a place in the modern medium landscape ; the environmental argument against them be flaw , for example the newsprint and newspaper industry environmental action group nnieag state that : recycled paper make up 77 . 4 of the raw material for uk newspaper in 2010 1 so the claim regard the amount of waste newspaper generate be not actually as high a be be suggest . 
point : in the internet age , newspapers be no longer financially profitable business . they be struggle to encourage investment and to survive in the long term . revenue be fall across the three main stream available to newspaper : sale , advertising and subscription . sales and subscription be drop a consumer move to the internet for information often the website of the newspaper themselves ! 1 advertising be not a profitable either , a increasingly advertiser look to pop up system on website and buy space on search engine . many newspaper have resort to cut cost fire staff , reduce the length of the paper and raise price . yet it do not seem likely that people will be willing to pay more for less . 
counterpoint : this argument overstate the situation . newspapers be less profitable than they be at their peak , but newspaper have be affect by other medium ever since the invention of the radio . much of the evidence the proposition have raise focus on the western world . according to the world association of newspapers , more newspaper be be publish than at any time previously . there be strong growth market in asia , eastern europe and south america . the middle east and africa also sustain strong market , though there be less growth 1 .
