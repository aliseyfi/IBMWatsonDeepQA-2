Point:The freedom of the press is protected in law throughout the world including United States where it is protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution. It is subject to defamation law but the balance is fine, moving to a more regulated system would be an attack on the ideal of a free press and all that it has achieved. The idea of a free press in a crucial lynch pin behind the concept of democracy because how can one make a truly informed decision if their information sources a forcibly limited; on the subject of press freedom Thomas Jefferson in a letter to Physician James Currie1 states that: "Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost." It is therefore important that the ability of the press to be truly free is not sacrificed as democracy and liberty would go with it.
Counterpoint:The line between the freedom of the press and the right to privacy is indeed fine, however the current balance is too far in favor of the news conglomerates than it is the individual. In the same letter, previous to the proposition quote from Thomas Jefferson, the president also states that: 'I deplore...the putrid state into which our newspapers have passed, and the malignity, the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those who write them…These ordures are rapidly depraving the public taste.”1 What this demonstrates is that while the freedom of the press is important it does not mean that it should necessarily be free from all law, left unregulated the press could, like people, become corrupted by the power the have over society. The freedom of the press idea should be upheld however this should not simply mean that it is above any governance.
Point:If the press were legally obliged to go in-front of a judge before publishing stories which may potentially contain material of a defaming nature the process of news gathering would be greatly damaged. While getting the balance between immediacy and privacy is important bringing in the judiciary to look over all written material before allowing it to be published is an entirely wrong move. As well as being a affront on freedom of speech it would also overload the courts with needless work, making the system of upholding laws inefficient and costly. Media lawyer Mark Stevens states that this idea "...would shear the media of the ability to report matters of public interest and thus look into corruption lurking in those dark corners the rich and powerful would rather were kept out of sight"1
Counterpoint:The amount of stories which the press would have to bring to the attention of the judiciary would be a relatively small percentage of the amount total amount of stories which the press publish, and not even all stories with defamation shades in them will necessarily go to court. All a new law would do would allow all people to have the "...the right to have an editor's decision to publish reviewed by a judge before irreparable damage can be done"1 While the freedom of the press is important so equally is the right to privacy; as the media have an unequal freedom of expression it is only right to ensure that their power is kept in check to ensure that other human rights are respected and maintained and not simply disregarded due to the economic might of communication conglomerates.
Point:The primary role of a free press in society is to act as watchdog and hold people, governments and companies to account for their actions, as a result news media organizations have a powerful role to play in society. Due to this there is, in all western nations, some kind of regulation of the media to ensure that false or libelous claims are not unduly made. The media, under current levels of regulation, have managed to continue on in its crucial role for democracy successfully. Take for example the 2009 leak of MPs expenses in the UK that were published extensively by the Telegraph Group. Further regulation in the case of that story, in the name of controlling potential defamation, may have hindered the story coming to light and such abuses of power would have gone unchecked and continued on as normal.1 While occasionally claims can be unfairly made and lead to defamation on the whole maintaining the current light levels of regulation will ensure that the media can remain efficiently effective in its important role of making people accountable for their actions.
Counterpoint:It is agreed that the primary role of a free press is to hold people to account and act as a watchdog, however this can still easily be done without the need of defamation. All extra laws would do would be to ensure that the ideal of many western nations that one is "innocent until proven guilty" actually remains in place. It is wrong to suggest that a story such as the 2009 expenses scandal would not have been published if new regulations were in practice because such a story with so many wide-reaching ramifications would always be allowed to be published regardless as to whether there may be a hint of defamation simply due to the high levels of public importance, new regulation would simply limit needless and entirely unfounded cases of defamation. It is also incorrect to state that current regulation is fit for purpose, take for example the current News of the World phone hacking scandal whereby numerous phones of celebrities, government ministers and victims of terrorism were illegally tapped, this is not a good display of regulation working. The problem in the UK in regards to regulation is that the press regulates itself; allowing organizations with such power to effectively regulate themselves and sometimes against their own immediate interest does not work.
