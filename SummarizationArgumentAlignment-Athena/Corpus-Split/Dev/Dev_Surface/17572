Point:In the United States, there are currently very different identification requirements for voting from state to state, meaning that people often lose their vote when they change their place of residence. All states could require a photo ID, or the country could adopt a national voter identification standard, based on the 2008 federal standards for American driving licenses (often called the "Real ID Card"). These actions would ensure against voter fraud and make it easier for people to maintain an active citizenship. In addition to cutting down on lost votes, this system would make the electoral process more legitimate in the eyes of the public, a factor that could itself raise voter turnout.
Counterpoint:If a country were to simply require IDs, it would discriminate against less-well-off people who are less likely to have ID, and with a national voting identification system, it would infringe upon its citizens' privacy. There are several objections to a national voting identification standard. In the United States, voting procedures are administered by the states, and the federal government should not interfere in their affairs. If uniformity were desirable, it would be better to scrap all voter identification laws, returning to the previous situation, in which you simply register to vote when you move and don't need special identification at the polling booth. Finally, a national identity card is in itself an invasion of privacy, leading the way to a police state and the dangers associated with poor data management on the part of the government, including identity theft. Especially in an age when all of this information would be stored on internet databases, the risk of hackers accessing a national identification system is too high.
Point:There is a long history of voter impersonation throughout the United States, where there have been varying levels of identification laws. In their book, Dirty Little Secrets: The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics, Larry Sabato and Glenn Simpson write, "For much of the last century and a good part of this century, elections in many states and localities became contests of the voting fraud capacities of various factions and parties."1 They go on to cite many cases of fraud throughout history, from New York City in 1844 to California in 1996. One recent example of voter fraud was in 2010 in the U.K., where identification is not required, when the Daily Mail published claims of a "massive postal-vote rigging," and a journalist for the Independent was allegedly beat while investigating fraud in eastern London2.Voter fraud not only interferes with individual elections, but also undermines voter confidence in representative government generally. Identification requirements are the most direct and effective way of combating election fraud. As such, states have a compelling interest in implementing these laws. Even in cases where evidence of voter fraud has not yet been proven, it can logically be assumed that an electoral system will have more integrity if voters are required to show identification. Regardless of actual cases of voter fraud, a system with identification laws will encourage higher voter turnout, because citizens will perceive the system as having more integrity. Voter fraud exists, but evidence of its occurrence in the specific place where voter identification requirements are being considered is not necessary in order to justify the new laws; voters should have to identify themselves no matter what.1 Rant World Blog.

Counterpoint:Voter fraud is a vastly exaggerated problem used in the United States as a smokescreen for a growing conservative strategy of disenfranchising poor and minority voters. If voter impersonation were such a grave problem, the government would prosecute violators. Although the Department of Justice poured unprecedented resources into voter fraud prevention under the Bush Administration, they did not prosecute a single offender, finding "no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections."1 Independent studies on voter fraud as well have found strikingly little evidence of it occurring in U.S. elections. A study by the Brennan Center for Justice, at the New York University School of Law, found that only 0.0009 of the votes in the 2004 elections in Washington were fraudulent2. In advance of Crawford v. Marion County, the Brennan Center filed an amicus brief saying that "impersonation fraud is an extremely unlikely and unsubstantiated occurrence that can be prevented without requiring a photo ID."3 This is an incredibly small number, and one not worthy of infringing on voting rights for.Even in very tight elections there is no evidence that voting fraud affects the outcome. This implies that in the United States, the true purpose behind these laws is to resurrect Jim Crow-era barriers to voting for poor and minority communities, who are more likely to vote Democrat.1 Lipton, Eric, and Ian Urbina.

Point:People are already required to produce valid identification for a whole range of activities that are less important than casting a vote, such as going to the gym or buying a drink. Why is voting the only activity where we make it easy to cheat the system? The claims that voter identification laws are discriminatory, or that they would discourage people from voting are silly because so many aspects of everyday life require photo identification, that this would not realistically discourage people from voting.
Counterpoint:It is false to imply that presenting a photo ID would be easy for everybody. Although voting is a very important process for the health of a democracy, it is not necessarily a priority for many citizens, and so even the smallest barriers can be damaging. The idea that everybody uses photo identification all of the time is not true, especially for less-well-off people. Not everybody takes air planes or has a gym membership or owns a car. Ultimately, it doesn't matter how easy other aspects of life are; what matters is the effect that voter identification laws would have on the electoral process.
Point:Studies have shown that nearly 100 countries around the world have photo identification requirements for voting,[1] so the USA would not be unique in asking its citizens to provide proof of their identity at the polling station. This also suggests that it is not too difficult to organise voting IDs, as democracies much poorer than the United States succeed in doing so. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who is currently Co-Chair of the Commission on Federal Election Reform, is a Democrat who supports voter identification laws. He points out, “Mexico and most poor democracies in the world have been able to register and give IDs to almost all their citizens.”[2] Indeed, it is bizarre to many election experts around the world that the United Kingdom and many parts of the United States do not require identification. Innocent Chukwuma, an election monitor who has observed elections in Nigeria and the UK said, of the UK system, “If you had this system in Nigeria, the outsiders would say the potential for abuse would be massive.”[3] Meanwhile voter identification has been a challenge worth meeting for most of the world. Even India—by far the largest democracy in the world—created in 2009 the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which will provide a national identity card to all Indians, which they can use at polling stations.[4] Countries around the world have set the standard by proving that voter identification laws are practical ways of improving the integrity of elections. Those countries that have not yet adopted the system should do so.
Counterpoint:Many of the countries that require voter identification cards are not full democracies, and those that are have automatic and permanent registration systems that provide the IDs for free, which is not the case in the United States. In these systems, IDs can become a political weapon, with supporters of opposition parties being denied votes through government manipulation of the registration system and biased checks at polling stations. It is also notable that such a comparable democracy as Great Britain does not have voter identification requirements. Thus the record for voter identification systems is mixed throughout the world, and the fact that these laws are popular internationally does not make them a good idea.
