Point:Current policies are obviously not working. Increased life expectancy and badly thought out pension provisions mean that an increasing number of old people fall into poverty. In a recent survey in the UK 57% of people interviewed were concerned that the pensions of their elderly relatives would not be sufficient to sustain them for the rest of their lives1. The elderly need to be provided for, and as the state is struggling, children must step forward and fill this void.
Counterpoint:People are already being expected to pay higher contributions towards their pensions, retire later and accept lower payouts, implying that children are legally responsible for their parents past adulthood would further suggest that the failure of the state pension scheme is somehow acceptable (The key points of pension changes can be viewed at 'Spending Review' BBC News).
Point:Rather than adopting a 'right now' attitude to government policies on taxes and spending, individuals would be more likely to think about the long-term consequences of government policy – knowing that their future is directly tied to the financial future of their children. This short term thinking has become a serious problem meaning there are big holes in pension funds and the government may not have enough to pay for elderly care in the future. For example Sir Derek Wanless has warned that the amount spent by government, individuals and organizations in Britain on caring for the sick and disabled elderly will increase from £10 billion a year to £20 billion a year by 2026.(‘cost of caring for the elderly set to double’, Templeton) Therefore voters would support financially sensible policies that avoid increasing deficits and national debt.
Counterpoint:There is no evidence to suggest that people would vote for more 'financially sensible policies' if they thought the provision of their care was tied up with their children's financial future. The decision to support decisions that may prove disadvantageous in the long run comes about with the sense of urgency in the current situation – something that would not be changed dramatically whether or not this law was introduced. If anything this law could encourage people to become neglectful in their own savings under the assumption that they will be ‘taken care of’ should things to go wrong. Personal debt would increase and the culture of ‘spend now, pay later’ would be reinforced.
Point:Everybody should have a responsibility to each other. The elderly, as a social group, have been largely neglected by society. By starting at grass roots, legalizing the responsibility of the young to look after the old, would benefit society in general and promote the respect of the elderly. Elderly people are equal citizens with equal rights, they deserve to have enough money for a secure and decent life in retirement with access to the health and social care that they need. Yet more and more old people are dying each year of malnutrition or freezing to death in their homes: over the last five years there has been an increase in winter deaths by 25,000 every year - this is unacceptable .1 Although commitments to the rights of older people do exist, for example the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, they are not legally binding, more needs to be done to ensure that the care of the elderly is adopted as a legal priority by governments2and by whole communities; this law would be the first step in that process.
Counterpoint:Legalizing the need to care for the elderly may have the opposite effect effect – it pits the young and old against one another, drawing legal distinctions and assuming the two’s interests are opposed. It could too easily breed scorn and resentment from the younger generation. Rather than having a moral obligation towards parents that one loves and who have provided for you, they will simply become a legal burden. This would ultimately damage the relationship between parent and child at a time when role-reversal makes the relationship strained anyway (See ‘Caring for Elderly Parents’, Laterlife and Savundranayagam, ‘A Dimensional Analysis’).
Point:This law would give parents a greater stake in their child's education and development. Rather than being concerned with saving for later life they will want to think about the future and long term prospects of their children. Similarly a child would be legally responsible for the well being of their parent past adulthood, encouraging children to think more carefully about the decisions they make in regards to care. The stark figures that between 2005 and 2009, 667 elderly people died from dehydration in care homes and 157 died of malnutrition1 suggest that children neglect their parents in terms of ensuring they are placed in adequate care. Passing a law would ensure that this no longer happens and family ties between generations would be strengthened.
Counterpoint:There are fundamental dangers in monetarising a relationship between child and parent. From young a child would be made to feel responsible for their parents as they are reduced to a mere investment. Furthermore this financial way of thinking may see a parent pushing their child down a path simply because it is financially rewarding. The neglect of the elderly in society is due to an increased distancing between generations and placing responsibility of the sick and aging onto the state – a social and cultural change that a law cannot simply undo 1.
Point:The law would legislated so that it is fair to all. When looking at cases the courts would inevitably make children pay in proportion to their means – so the rich have to pay more than the poor, but the state could also help those who are too poor to support their parents. The policy will therefore aid the poorest members of society. Parents who are not well off and will spend most of their income caring for their children will be ones most at risk of suffering from poverty in their old age. This law would ensure that these people are cared for adequately. Moreover, judicial oversight can be used to make sure the application of the law is fair, that a parent can’t make a claim if they have abandoned, neglected or abused their children, or if the children themselves are too poor to support the elderly parent.
Counterpoint:In practice this will never work, many parents would be unwilling to sue their own children for support, or in many cases even admit that they need the support. This policy will disproportionately hurt poor families and it will widen the social gap. While rich parents will be able to afford raising their children in comfort, giving them the best opportunities, while also saving money for their retirement, poor families will end up saddling their children with the duty to care for elderly parents, thus preventing them from accruing wealth, having more disposable income that they could invest or spending more money on their own children's education. This will trap wealth within rich families and will mean poor families will find it harder to break out of poverty.
