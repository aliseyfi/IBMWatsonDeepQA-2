Point:The ability to marry people who are already married presents us with the chance to take partners that have already proven themselves in society as responsible parents and providers - that is, to reduce the risk in marriage. It also means that one doesn't have to settle for those "left over"; you can marry the person you want, not just the person that's left. Very few countries have exactly the same number of males and females; in the UAE, there are 2.2 males per female, but in Estonia, there are only 0.84 males per female1. This means that monogamy restricts options significantly.1'Sex ratio', The CIA World Factbook, accessed June 2011 [1]
Counterpoint:The idea of taking an ‘established’ partner simply because of their status is anathema in the modern age – it implies that income determines suitability as partner, and suggests that the partner concerned will forever be dominant in the relationship. That logic would see CEOs with 10 wives and unemployed people with none - hardly supportive of the ‘everyone should be able to marry’ model this proposition argument supports. Furthermore, it is difficult to decipher statistics like these. Many people don’t want to marry. Certainly, not everyone wants to marry at once, which would be needed for statistics on total population to be of any use.
Point:More providers can make great contributions to the home. It makes the family unit more efficient, as more people can pursue careers and bring in money, but due to economies of scale, less additional money will be needed for each additional partner. For example, it is cheaper to cook in large quantities than if each person were cooking individually. Similarly, additional people in the house won’t need another kitchen or necessarily another bathroom, so therefore it’s cheaper to live in groups – particularly groups with multiple incomes. In addition, there is more likely to be a person staying at home, which saves on childcare. While it will not always be the case there are many ways in which living in groups can be more economical.
Counterpoint:Just because something is economically efficient, it isn't necessarily better. The idea that one of the best reasons for marrying an additional person is because it will cost less in the long run completely undermines the ideals of love that marriages are based on. Furthermore, in many societies where men can have multiple wives, it is actually expensive, as the man is expected to provide for everybody as well as pay dowries, so it is economically unsound1. If there are extra adult incomes, they must be shared amongst the extra adults, and often get soaked up in the high number of children polygamous relationships tend to produce.1 Isaac Sagala, 'Should Sudan discard expensive polygamy?', 25th May 2010 [2]
Point:Polygamy reduces the strains on family life and minimises the likelihood of breakdown and divorce. Polygamy reduces the desire for adultery by providing alternatives for sexual exploration within the family unit. Sibel Üresin suggests that people look for a lot of qualities in a spouse, and that it is unlikely that any one person can possess them all, which is why there is so much adultery in monogamous relationships.[1]
Counterpoint:Even if the marriages last longer this is likely to be based upon feeling subservient to their spouse (nearly always husband) and so feeling powerless and unable to get a divorce1. Adultery is based on a desire for the 'other', for something outside the known, outside the home. Polygamy does nothing to combat this; adultery still occurs in polygamous societies. Indeed, polygamy encourages adultery as it dilutes the idea of fidelity from being loyalty to one person, substituting the legitimacy of intercourse with many. In a study in Nigeria it was found that men with three or more wives were more likely to engage in extramarital sex2.1 Thom Brooks, The Problem of Polygamy, University of Newcastle, 2009 p.5 (accessed 14/06/11) [6]2 Ibid pp.5-6
Point:The idea that the individual can only truly love one person is artificial and false, a product of a particular time, place and culture. In fact, in a study on human societies worldwide, of 1231 societies noted, only 186 were entirely monogamous1. Polygamy is not about freedom to fornicate with anyone; it's about cementing relationships with individuals one wants to spend the rest of one's life with, just as in monogamous marriages.1 George P. Murdock, Ethnographic Atlas Codebook (recording the marital composition of societies 1960-1980) [7]
Counterpoint:Marriage is about devotion to another, the giving of oneself wholly to that person, granting love to them to the exclusion of all others. How could one have such a relationship with more than one person? It's not possible to devote yourself entirely to more than one person. Polygamy therefore necessarily involves the exploitation of at least one party - and the denigration of the relationship that exists between the others.
Point:The law should recognise freedom of choice. If somebody wants to marry more than one person, and all parties involved agree, then the state should not get involved. We have a right to privacy, and a right to non-interference in our family life. These are not absolute rights, but they are important: breach of them needs to be contemplated with extreme care and is not merited here. This is particularly important because some religious sects promote polygamy, so banning it also impinges on freedom of religion.
Counterpoint:In most cases, some of the partners involved in polygamy will not have true freedom of choice. Presumably, one of the partners will be proposing the addition of another person to the marriage; the first partner may well not truly desire this, but feel unable to refuse. This could particularly be a problem in religious groups that are happy for men to marry many women, but deny women the same freedom. Daphne Bramham studied a polygamous community in Canada and concluded: "Within that particular group, those women have absolutely no choice. They are separated from the mainstream community."1 Whilst a law that allowed polygamy might give a handful of people more freedom, it would actually deny it to many others.1 Daphne Bramham, The Secret Lives of Saints: Child Brides and Lost Boys in Canada's Polygamous Mormon Sect (Random House, 2008)
