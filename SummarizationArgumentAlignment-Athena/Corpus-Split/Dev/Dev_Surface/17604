Point:Apple has gone to greater lengths to make using their computers easy to use than PC makers have. Mac apps all have similar looks and interfaces. Juul Coolen explains that consistent interface design “made it possible for users to actually use most Mac-applications in a very same way, creating a seamless and comfortable experience in the end. Users are able to anticipate how the system behaves and what to expect from its applications”[1]. This has been corroborated by people who have tried both PCs and Macs. Popular Mechanics conducted a usability survey that incorporated a “panel of testers with a range of experience and preference that ran the gamut from expert users to…[one person who] had never actually turned on a computer”[2] and concluded that overall the Mac was easier to use.
Counterpoint:Most people are already accustomed to Windows, meaning whether Macs are more intuitive is superfluous as they already know how to operate a PC. “Windows…is already the OS of choice in over 90 percent of worldwide machines. Switching [to a Mac] isn’t just a matter of transferring files: it’s also about interface familiarity and availability of software.”[1] PCs are easier to use because people are already used to them.
Point:Tests of speed on Macs vs. PCs all conclude the same thing: Macs are faster. PC world tested this in 2007 and concluded: “The fastest Windows Vista notebook we’ve tested this year–or for that matter, ever–is a Mac”[1]. Popular Mechanics verified this, basing its test “both on a panel of users judging the computers on subjective points, as well as a series of benchmarking applications on both platforms. In both the laptop [5] and desktop showdowns, Apple’s computers were the winners," the magazine said.[2] Mac hardware is faster than PC hardware, and Mac applications run faster as well.
Counterpoint:In reality, “speed, stability and multi-tasking on a computer really depend on a number of factors, from how many programs (and what type) you have running to how much RAM you have installed – a souped up gaming or desktop-replacement PC may well (on paper and most likely speed tests) outperform a top-of-the-line Mac Pro, both processing-wise and price-wise”[1]. Speed is mostly a function of what one has running on the computer, and how good the computer is, not which company makes it. Because Macs are more expensive, you can add RAM to a PC to make it faster, while still paying less.
Point:The Forrester Research, a survey of 4,500 consumers, rated Apple an 80%, which is interpreted as good. However, “Gateway scored a 66; Hewlett-Packard, a 64; and Compaq (a brand owned by H.P.), a 63 — scores that Forrester considers “poor” rankings in the customer experience index. Dell got 58 percent, a “very poor” rating.”[1] Bruce Tempkin, the vice president of Forrester, commented that the PC industry had indeed scored very poorly, and that this ought to serve as a “wake-up call to Microsoft.”[2] This study corroborates a previous survey conducted by Consumer Reports, which asked for feedback from 4,500 laptop computer users and almost 5,600 desktop computer users after they had called in for tech support. Peter Cohen reported the results: “Consumer Reports rated customer satisfaction with tech support on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the most satisfied. Apple scored an 83 in the laptop survey and an 81 on the desktop side…Apple was the only manufacturer to top 80 in either category.” The highest-scoring competitors for laptops ranged from 48 to 66, and for desktops from 47 to 56.[3] By all measures and in all categories, Macs have far better customer support.
Counterpoint:While Apple may have pretty good service, their repairs are almost as costly as buying a new computer. The PC retailer PC Pro argues, “The standard Apple technical support offering is nothing short of scandalous. You could pay £13,500 for an absolute top-of-the-range Mac Pro or £399 for a Mac mini, and you're still lumbered with Apple's standard warranty, which comprises a pitiful 90-days, telephone support and just one year's return-to-base hardware warranty.”[1] Many PCs, by comparison come with longer warranties, making the cost of repairs much lower.
Point:Macs run into fewer problems when operating than PCs, because Macs are harder to target and most viruses target PCs. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, explains: “Mac is more secure, simply because it has less attacks targeting it…[hackers’] existing codebase and expertise is on Windows, so they keep creating more Windows attacks”[1]. Paul Vixie, founder of the Internet Systems Consortium, agrees, saying that Macs are more secure because the code base is small and more modern, and because there are fewer Mac users, so there is less in it for the “bad guys” who make the viruses.[2] Although it is true that both can get viruses, evidence shows that PCs do get them far more often.[3] Moreover, even if PCs aren’t getting viruses, it’s likely because they have to constantly have antivirus software running in the background, which slows them down.
Counterpoint:In reality, Vista and Windows 7 have “more extensive countermeasures against attacks and a codebase with presumably fewer security issues….Mac OS has fewer countermeasures and lots of easily exploitable bugs, but the market share is low, making it a less likely target” [1]. So, it may be true that there are more viruses targeted towards PCs, but PC makers have taken steps to combat this. Moreover, according to one expert, Graham Cluley, “it's not about the operating system that is being run on the computer, it's the fleshy human sitting in front of it”[2]. Whether or not your computer is attacked depends on what you do on it and how careful you are. Vincent Weafer, vice president of Symantec Security Response, agrees: “all technologies are subject to security vulnerabilities, including the Web browsers, common Web browser plug-ins and common applications that run on top of the operating systems. So in reality, consumers can fall victim to online threats regardless of the operating system they're using.”[3] So, although Mac users may be targeted less, both PC and Mac users are susceptible to viruses.
