Point:Poaching has been effectively eliminated in parts of Southern Africa through efficient game park management and the development of game tourism, which gives local peoples an incentive to protect wildlife as a long-term economic resource. In Kenya, tourism is the third largest contributor to their economy, and 70% of this is derived from wildlife, but it is still not enough1. The Director of the association in Kenya charged with elephant protection, the Lusaka Agreement Taskforce, has admitted mobilizing adequate resources to combat the illegal wildlife trade is a challenge2. For this approach to be sustained the parks must generate greater income; realistically, this can only be done through the sale of stockpiled ivory. Why should they not be able to profit from stockpiled ivory confiscated from poachers or dead elephants?
Counterpoint:Permitting the sale of stockpiled ivory only provides an incentive to clamp down on poachers once they have completed their poaching. As a result, little weight is given to the welfare of the elephant. States hoping to profit from the sales of stockpiles are in essence being encouraged to work in cohorts with poachers; poachers get the ivory, they then get 'caught' by the state who give them a cut of subsequent sales of the 'confiscated' ivory. An entire black market could evolve whereby both the state and poachers profit, with the elephant population the only loser.
Point:Ivory is expensive to store, and degrades over time. It costs Zimbabwe $13 million annually to secure its stockpile1. The Wildlife Authority in the country is now keen for the moratorium on the international sale of ivory to end in 2016 so that they can benefit from the stockpiling and recoup the costs of storage1. Zimbabwe is also believed to be close to the limit of its storage space1. It is therefore sensible to allow its sale in order to recoup these expenses and to do so on a permanent, controlled basis, rather than through one-off schemes such as the 1999 sale to Japan.
Counterpoint:Storage costs and depreciation are only problems if ivory is stored in the hope of eventual sale. Kenya's game conservancy burns the ivory it obtains from culls or confiscates from poachers, avoiding both of these problems and showing its commitment to ending all possibility of renewed trade1. If Zimbabwe is truly committed to the long-term viability of its elephant population, it would do similarly and burn its large, existing stockpile. Kenya has also advanced plans to send all confiscated ivory to a museum where the items can be displayed and income generated in a sustainable fashion2. Both solutions remove the costs incurred in stockpiling confiscated ivory.
Point:The elephant populations of southern African states are growing rapidly, placing a strain upon the resources of the national parks in which they live. This has necessitated culls with the result that government environment agencies have built up large stockpiles of ivory (also acquired from animals that died naturally), which they are currently unable to sell. Relaxing the CITES ban on trading ivory, subject to careful regulation, would bring much needed cash to the environmental programmes of these impoverished countries, helping them to safeguard the long-term survival of African elephants. The relaxation of the CITES ban in the late '90s was worth $5 million for Bostwana, Namibia and Zimbabwe; as regular income, such a figure would be invaluable for a struggling Central African economy.
Counterpoint:Although elephant populations in southern Africa are viable and increasing, this is not the case elsewhere in Africa, nor is it true of the wild Asian elephant populations of South Asia. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report that 'while some populations of elephants in Southern or Eastern Africa are stable or recovering, forest elephants in Central Africa are in grave danger from poaching, fuelled by demand for illegal ivory'1. In many of these areas, it is not a problem of large populations of elephants straining resources, but reductions in rainfall and warfare endangering already-small groups of elephants2. Lifting the ban would only encourage the use of these endangered animals and their prized ivory for short-term income.
Point:States that possess elephant populations that are currently growing would be eligible, under the new model, to sell their stockpiled ivory. There would be no limit on the amount of ivory sold, provided that the growth rate of the population remained positive. Therefore, the confiscated ivory from poachers and small-scale culls would be eligible to be sold on the international market. All sales would have to go through the environmental agencies of the states' concerned.
Counterpoint:Any model that lifts the absolute ban on the ivory trade will lead to unnecessary and extensive culling. DNA evidence from the most recent lifting of the ban in 2008 found that 'some tusks…originate from African countries not taking part in the CITES sales…suggesting that the commodity is being shipped across borders before being exported into Asia’ 1. Therefore, the intent of the proposed model to differentiate between those countries with sustainable populations and those without is short-sighted at best. Legalizing even a restricted ivory trade will make all elephants, however endangered their local populations, targets for poachers and governments alike.
Point:A trading ban does not choke off demand for the ivory, but instead raises the price to exorbitant levels, encouraging poaching. Demand since 1989 has been depressed by Japan's economic problems, from which it is now emerging, while in China ivory is associated with prosperity and is a status symbol; as the number of wealthy Chinese increases, so too is the demand and price of ivory. Poachers are only going to be further encouraged to disregard the trading ban, whatever the costs1. Legitimate, regulated sales would undercut the illegal market and drive the poachers out of business, ensuring elephant populations are protected and remain stable.
Counterpoint:The trading ban is the best option available to restrict the ivory trade and protect elephant populations. It will never be able to stop all trade in ivory, particularly because many of the African states from which the ivory is sold lack governments with a monopoly on force and uncorrupted officials. Nevertheless, the ban is more effective than its alternative.
