Point:Due to the rules around Olympic Football in regards to qualifying, which make it impossible for the United Kingdom to qualify, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for footballers of the UK to play Olympic Football.
Counterpoint:While the opportunity for a UK team to play in the Olympics is a unique occurrence due to how qualification is organized it is not in itself an adequate argument in favor of a UK team.
Point:One of the major barriers of the UK entering a team into the Olympics has been gaining the permission of FIFA, whose stance has traditionally been that the UK cannot play as separate nations in FIFA and UEFA football tournaments and then come together for the Olympics as one team, they must be either entirely together or entirely separate.
Counterpoint:It is one thing to get FIFA to grant permission for the creation of a one off UK football team, it is entirely another issue trying to get the separate national footballing bodies working together never-mind having to harmonize the political pressures from the devolved Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments who fear the bringing the footballing nations together could symbolically threaten their growth or even existence. It is a misnomer to suggest that just because FIFA has granted permission the barriers are lower than ever, with devolved governments gaining ever more power the situation has become more complicated than previous years. The Scottish would also state that the Act of Union analogy argument is flawed, many Scots believe that they were forced into the union against their will by the English and that this is the same situation with the creation of this unified UK Football team. While the removal of the FIFA barrier is useful to those who want a UK team it is arguably one of the easier practical problems to overcome in the creation of the team.
Point:The Olympic Creed states that "The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well."1
Counterpoint:While the Olympic Spirit is a noble one it is fundamentally too simplistic to say that by not entering a UK team the Olympic Creed is undermined. For the nations of the UK to sacrifice their footballing history which has a longer legacy than the modern Olympics whereby the football event is not even taken entirely seriously, is absurd. The Olympic Creed is simply a marketing invention by IOC (International Olympic Committee) in order to give the host nations, which spend millions on hosting them, a justification for doing so which stretches far beyond sport.
