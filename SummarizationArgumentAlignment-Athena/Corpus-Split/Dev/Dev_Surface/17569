Point:The normal curriculum can only go so far as to teach and educate students about academic theories. But students whose only experience of school or college is one of rigid academic study may not be able to apply what they have learned in practice.1 Extra curricular activities encourage a diverse range of skills and methods of learning that encompass the diverse needs of students. For example, schemes such as Young Enterprise allow students to experience of practical business skills and valuable communication and team work skills. If the extra-curriculum was given an equal footing in student life there will be an improvement in the student ability to grasp things as a whole, because students will have received a more rounded education.
Counterpoint:The academic curriculum is the priority of schools and must continue to be given more status in schools and colleges than the extra-curriculum. Students are meant to be receiving an education and gaining recognised qualifications which will help them to progress in their chosen career.1 And if extra-curricular activities distract students from focusing on their academic qualifications, then they could be actually harmful.
Point:Many children have talents in all sorts of different areas, and it is wrong to force them to specialise too early. 'Every child and young person is entitled to experience a broad general education'1 Even if a student does not aim to be a professional musician they should still have opportunity to learn an instrument. A career is not the only, or most the important, part of an adult's life – school needs to make sure they have interests and skills that will help them in their family and leisure lives too. Through equal balancing of academic and extra-curriculum, however, the students have the chance to exercise their rights, learn a diverse range of skills and the opportunity to be multi-talented.
Counterpoint:Students should also have the right to focus on the subjects or activities that they want or need to. If extra-curricular activities are so good, then students should have right to choose whether they wish to pursue them, rather than forcing them to give equal importance to something they do not wish to do. Through equalising the demands of academic and extra-curriculums there exists the possibility that a student may drop out because he or she may not be able to cope with the demands of both sets of activities.1 The right to an education is best exercised by giving students the choice to decide what field their lives would like to be based on, and about how to pursue these aims.
Point:Most extra-curricular activities are physically active, getting the student out from behind their desk and making them try new things. Physical activity is extremely important for general health whilst ensuring that students are exposed to practical tasks, not just what is taught in class.1 Sports clubs and teams give students the opportunity to do physical exercise in an enjoyable environment whilst activities such as the Duke of Edinburgh award teach skills such as map reading and organisation of a group. The outcome of giving the extra-curriculum the same status as the curriculum will therefore be well balanced individuals. Schools have a pastoral duty to consider the well-being of their pupils which includes physical health and practical abilities.
Counterpoint:It is not clear that extra-curricular activity needs to be formally recognised in order to fulfil this role. The importance is exercising, not whether it is assessed or not. Many extra-curricular activity are not physically demanding (such as debating) and so would be of little health use. Society needs to ensure that students are taught specialisms to an appropriate degree.1 Most modern careers require expert knowledge and skills, which can take years to acquire. The Prime Minister does not play soccer or tango in the House of the Commons, therefore they do not require such skills as part of their formal education.
Point:Boosting the place of the extra-curriculum in schools is one way of addressing a weakness in modern society, a lack of civil strength and community. Activities offered in schools are vital in providing opportunities to learn the diverse skills help to equip young people with the civic spirit, initiative and organising skills to set up their own clubs, teams and activity groups when they leave education. An article in The Guardian argues that 'The riots suggest that the education system must concern itself with a lot more than simple exam results'.1 A successful extra-curriculum often depends on building links between the school and the wider community, bringing local enthusiasts in to work with students, and sending students out to work on community projects, help in primary schools, perform for local audiences, etc. Thus, extra-curricular activities have wider social implications than the individual schools and pupils.
Counterpoint:Giving extra-curricular activities greater importance in education can be harmful to civil society as a whole. There are many clubs, teams and groups available for young people already in most areas e.g. Scouts, religious work, music, drama, sport, voluntary work in the community, etc. Only giving school-based activities credit can damage clubs and group beyond the walls of the schools. Often pursuits offered by schools end up replicating those already available in the wider community. For example, a school hockey team may deprive the local town’s hockey club of young players, while school adventure activities might weaken the community’s Scouting and Guiding groups. This would be a shame as a strong civil society is vital to a thriving democratic culture, but also because groups that involve people of all ages possess great social and educational value.
