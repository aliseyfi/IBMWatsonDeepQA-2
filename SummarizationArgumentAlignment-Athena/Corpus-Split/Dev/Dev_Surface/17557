Point:The uncertainty of employment in politics is well known to every aspiring and incumbent politician, and prompts a delicate balancing act between one’s dedication to the general public and posturing for future employment. Current salaries force politicians to look to the private sector to find additional work in order to offset what are often steps down, at least in monetary value, from their previous positions taken in order to become an elected representative. In Britain, Members of Parliament earn £65,000, a decent wage but nowhere near the salary many MPs would expect in the private sector[1]. Therefore, rather than forcing elected representatives to pander to interest groups to provide future security, it would be better to seek to counter the incentives offered by the private sector and for the state to offer to guarantee retired and defeated politicians a pension, or funding to update their professional skills to increase their employability. The financial security such packages would offer would also allow elected representatives to spend more time in government and with the public they purport to represent.
Counterpoint:The state cannot ever hope to provide sufficient incentives to appease the desire of elected representatives to make money, particularly whilst they are in office and in demand as employees. The reality of political careers is that individuals who have held office are rarely required to pander to a single group in order to secure themselves a position once they leave office, rather the opposite in fact as they are sought after to fill a variety of posts from academic heads in Universities to CEOs of private enterprise or ambassadors or advisors for private and non- governmental organisations.1 As such, the promise of a pension package or an update to their professional skills would be futile. Furthermore in many political systems representatives are already awarded pensions upon leaving politics and have little urgent need to secure additional employment; that does not however prevent their drive however to hold additional posts whilst in office and to seek additional employment once ousted.2 1http [2]://inteldaily.com/2010/05/prime-ministers-presidents/ [accessed 16/06/2011] [2]2Oireachtas [3] (Allowances To Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1992 s.7, s.13.

Point:Elected representatives should be working for the people and take only their interests into account. Politicians who also run their own companies, hold directorships or manage extensive share portfolios could stand to gain or lose substantially from individual pieces of legislation. This is likely to affect their vote and so distort the political process. At worst this can become outright corruption, as groups with vested interests pay elected representatives to lobby on their behalf, or reward them with lucrative directorships if they vote in certain ways.
Counterpoint:Individuals elected to public office have been deemed by their constituents to be of sufficient quality to represent them. They will typically already have undergone intense public scrutiny into their private interests and affairs. Therefore to be voted into office is not merely a stamp of approval for one's mandate, but for one's judgement and ability to adequately represent their constituent's objectives. The inference of the proposition that an individual deemed intelligent and articulate enough to represent his electorate could not determine right from wrong and separate personal from public interest is manifestly hyperbolic. It further ignores the realities of political life which demand that if the politician wishes to be re-elected he must act in a way that accurately represents the views of the majority of his constituents rather than a minority group who are powerless to ensure his re-election. As such, fears of politicians having a conflict of interest are overblown, their political careers depend on satisfying their constituents and to do so they cannot afford, politically, to prioritize their personal interests.
Point:The public has a right to demand that its elected representatives work full time on its behalf. Legislators or ministers with outside interests will inevitably have less time and energy to devote to affairs of state and may become pre-occupied with outside interests or indeed devote time better spent advocating on behalf of their constituents seeking to gain support for personal endeavours connected to their other sources of income. Elected representatives are invested, through their election, with a democratic mandate and an attendant duty to represent and lobby for the interests of the individuals who elected them. By dividing their time and their attention, between posts and failing to prioritise their representative duties they risk compromising their ability to adequately participate in the process of Government. Henry Clay once remarked that "Government is a trust, and the officers of the government are trustees. And both...are created for the benefit of the people." While the context in which Clay made his remarks has very much altered the fundamental message it delivers remains as relevant today as it was at the time of its utterance- a trustee may hold no position which jeopardises his duty to his beneficiaries, neither can public representatives be allowed to engage in activities which jeopardize their duties to the people.
Counterpoint:The public only has the right to demand only that elected representatives work effectively on their behalf. If a representative can do so effectively and have time spare to hold down an additional post, why should he not be entitled to do so? The majority of representative bodies sit only for limited hours per week and remain out of session for weeks or even months, allowing many representatives more than sufficient time to deal with affairs of state and their outside interests.1Furthermore, the role of a representative is multi-faceted, requiring a range of skills and a breadth of knowledge that must constantly be expanded upon. As such, outside interests often mean that a representative is more informed of issues in a particular area and can lead to important connections which may allow them to lobby for the interests of their constituents more effectively.1 Quinlan, R., 'Ministers not taxed by double-jobbing' [20th February 2011] [accessed 16/06/2011] [9]
