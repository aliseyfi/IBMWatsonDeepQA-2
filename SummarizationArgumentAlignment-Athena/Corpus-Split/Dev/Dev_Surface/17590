Point:Parenting classes would need to be compulsory for a number of reasons. Firstly - for all of the subjectivity regarding parenting – there are clearly some cases where bad parenting is responsible for some of the child’s failings. A morbidly obese 15 year old with a criminal record, no school qualifications and poor health has, almost certainly, been let down by his or her parents. However the state has no way of knowing in advance as to which parents will struggle in this manner – hence it is better if the classes are for everyone. Furthermore, it seems fair to assume that parents who are somehow socially excluded, wilfully ignorant or suffering some other acute difficulty in raising children, would probably be less likely to take the active step of attending voluntary classes in the first place. According to a report on UK Children’s services referral to get help tends to be self-referral by those who have less need whereas those with higher needs have to be referred by others before they will accept the help[1]Thus voluntary classes may actually be structurally biased to miss the cases in which they are most needed. A compulsory system is likely to offer far better outcomes across society
Counterpoint:Making classes compulsory may make them less effective and useful for those who actually want to be there. Much as happens in school those who do not wish to attend are disruptive and take up the teacher's time so reducing the amount of time the teacher has for those who wish to learn.
Point:The state has a strong moral, practical and financial interest in the raising of its future citizens. This is why most liberal democracies offer extensive and costly child support systems (including child-support payments, free nursery care, parental leave arrangements) to aid parents in raising young people who can be active and respectful members of society. Louise Casey, Government Respect Co-ordinator, argues that the best results come from preventative action: “I think we have got to do everything to make sure we are tackling not just anti-social behaviour today, but preventing the next generation of people growing up with signs of anti-social behaviour in the future.” 1 Compulsory parenting classes could be a means to ensure the cohesion and prosperity of its future generations by raising the standard of parenting they receive.
Counterpoint:Financial considerations alone do not give the state the right to interfere in the raising of children and do not provide sufficient motivation for imposing a model of parenting. State intervention should be motivated by the best interests of its citizens and paternalistic measures should be avoided when possible in all liberal democracies. In 2003 Lord Irvine criticised Blunkett’s plans for compulsory parenting classes as "an extreme example of the nanny state" and a violation of human rights.1 Moreover, even if the implementation of parenting classes were unobjectionable, one would need evidence supporting a positive correlation between attending parenting classes, good parenting, and fall in anti-social behaviour.
Point:Given that it may not be possible to use legal or monitoring systems to encourage parents to take better care of their children,making parenting classes compulsory would help prioritise the best interests of the child (inhttp://www.fivecounties.on.ca/documents/WorkingTogether.pdf [8] terms of health and future opportunities) without necessarily constraining the educational choices of parents.Parenting classes would help ensure that parents know what is regarded as good for their children and would promote the rights of young people to a decent upbringing, whilst only minimally impacting on parents.In 2006, the then Home Secretary John Reid argues that 'By tackling bad parenting we are tackling child disadvantage and social exclusion. For example, 90 per cent of repeating juvenile offenders have a history of behaviour problems as a child.'1
Counterpoint:It is not at all clear that parenting classes set up by the state and aimed at furthering the interest of the state would benefit children and promote their best interests.1Historically, the judgement and motivation of parents have been the best means to guarantee the interests of children. For the state to interfere with the parents’ knowledge of their child’s needs would be damaging, not beneficial, to the overall quality of parenting.2
Point:In our times, when contraception is widely available and affordable, reproduction should be an active and responsible choice on the part of individuals. Parenting classes would be instrumental in ensuring that people reflect upon their decision to have children and understand the implications of their choice.Moreover, if the ‘lifestyle choice’ of having children is supported by the state (through tax breaks, benefits and entitlements), then it would seem that the state is justified in applying some minimal conditions to people who wish to benefit from its support. So parenting classes would be a means for the state to safeguard its interest in having responsible citizens.1
Counterpoint:The offer of state support for families does not justify state interference in childrearing. There is a fundamental difference between creating marginal incentives for citizens to have children through such mechanisms as the taxation system, and outright coercion, such as the removal of benefits or other significant state support. The former allows for meaningful autonomous decision making on the part of a citizen, whilst the latter places them in a coercive situation where their freedom is inherently compromised. This removes independence and autonomy from the individual. 1 The state should have limited powers in making decisions about what constitutes good parenting.
Point:Currently, information about parenting is scarce, patchy and inconsistent. It would benefit all if up-to-date parenting information provided by medical staff, psychologists, nutritionists, educators and so on, were made accessible and standardised: all parents would receive the same basic and essential information. And information is always valuable and often appreciated by those who receive it. The charity Barnardo’s argues that those who attended their classes ‘were unanimously positive about the impact of courses and were clear that attending them provided them with new skills and confidence in their parenting ability.’ 1Parenting classes would provide up-to-date and standardized information useful to guide prospective parents’ behaviour and it would not amount to imposing one model of parenting on all.
Counterpoint:First, it is not clear that parenting classes would improve the standards of parenting – for one, not all children need identical parenting and it would be too difficult to customise classes or to respond to the individual needs of parents and children. It is narrow-minded to assume that basic standard information would be sufficient for parents to deal with the range of children’s individual needs.Second, the state is not justified in imposing one model of behaviour on prospective parents.Third, information that is relevant to good parenting (what is good for children) is subject to change and it would be difficult to ensure that the information provided in compulsory parenting classes were up-to-date.1
