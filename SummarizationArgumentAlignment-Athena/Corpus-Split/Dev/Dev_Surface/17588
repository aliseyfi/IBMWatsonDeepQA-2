Point:A variety of international studies have found that increasing the cost of alcohol reduces its consumption, along with the health and social harms associated with it.
Counterpoint:Those who wish to drink heavily for a cheap price will turn to alternatives. Many of them will probably decide to buy black market alcohol. Russia is the example of a failed "minimum price" policy. When the prices rose people started to brew their own alcohol1. The statistical evidence for raising prices lowering drinks consumption is a best mixed2.
Point:It is the government's responsibility to promote the health and wellbeing of its citizens. Taxpayers are forced to pay for the cost of alcohol related ill-health and anti-social behavior. This is a waste of money that be being spent on other government priorities. This is an effective policy to deal with this issue. Free markets suffer from externalities– costs (such as pollution) that are created by only a few actors, but which everyone has to pay. So our whole society pays for the harms resulting from the ridiculously cheap alcohol associated with below-cost marketing and aggressive promotions. Families suffer terribly when a husband, mother or son is an alcoholic or violent drinker. Residents suffer from the anti-social behavior and crime associated with binge-drinking. Business loses millions of productive days’ work each year; according to the Institute of Alcoholic Studies, each day around 200,000 British workers turn up to work hung over from the night before. High proportions of hung over workers report problems such as lack of concentration and the inability to work at normal pace. In 2001 there was an attributable 1.2 billion pounds attributed to the loss in economy (in the UK), based only on alcohol attributed absence from work 1. All of this impacts the society, by losing overall economic wealth (through loss of productivity) and having to pour money to alcoholics’ health treatments. If these individuals in society do not want to stop with their activities, they should at least give back financially. In the state of Washington, we see that the state's beer, soda and bottled water tax gave the state $122 million in revenue in 2009, helping to close a $2.8 billion deficit. California could raise around $1.4 billion a year with a marijuana tax 2.
Counterpoint:The government is supposedly protecting the vulnerable with this policy. Yet they should consider the individuals who are considered vulnerable: alcoholics and young people.
Point:This measure will be good for public houses and bars (licensed premises), which have been struggling in recent years in comparison to supermarkets and discount retailers (off-licenses) that can sell alcohol much more cheaply. This is because they do not have the same overheads and can take advantage of economies of scale. Pubs often sell alcohol at rates that would be higher than any minimum price. Clubs and pubs which offer happy hours and other irresponsible drinks deals would be the only ones affected by this proposal1.
Counterpoint:This argument is hypothetical but does not seem plausible. Pubs provide a specific atmosphere and service. Yet they are not competing well with alternative sources of alcohol. That suggests that their service is desired infrequently or in some cases not at all. Raising prices is not likely to save such establishments, since any minimum price could not make alcohol from off-licenses more expensive than a pub (at most it could make them equally as costly). Since individuals are not willing to pay for the specific services of a pub, it's not clear why individuals would not just continue to avoid them and pay more for off-license alcohol.
