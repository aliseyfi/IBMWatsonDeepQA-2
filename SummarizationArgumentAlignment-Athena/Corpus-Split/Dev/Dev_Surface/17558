Point:Just as the promise of EU membership was a strong incentive for post-communist countries to democratise and restructure their economies in the 1990s, the offer of a deeper partnership could spur many Eastern and Southern Mediterranean states to embrace liberal reforms. Concepts such as the rule of law, human rights, political accountability, transparent decision-making and open markets are not only necessary for fair access to the EU's enormous Single Market, they are desirable in their own right. Often they are already being campaigned for by citizens in many of the non-EU Mediterranean countries who do not enjoy their benefits at the moment, although many of their governments react repressively to such demands. As the most successful project ever to promote democracy, security and prosperity, the EU has a responsibility to find ways of extending these benefits to as many people as possible. Catherine Ashton, the foreign affairs chief of the EU has said they stand ready to help Egypt build a deep rooted democracy "I reiterated that no matter what happens in the next hours and days, the European Union stands ready to help build the deep democracy that will underpin stability for the people of Egypt"1. Only if Maghreb and Mashriq countries think the EU is serious about offering them a real economic and political partnership will their governments make positive moves to reform.
Counterpoint:The non-EU countries around the Mediterranean will react badly to any EU attempt to bully or bribe them into "westernising". All are on different paths to reform (e.g. the economic opening of Libya before the overthrow of Gaddafi and the very different political developments in countries such as Turkey, Morocco and Lebanon). Each should be allowed to develop at its own pace, appropriate to local levels of economic and cultural development. The EU should encourage and support such changes, but should not seek to impose them; after all, many non-EU Mediterranean countries have bad memories of European colonial rule. There is also a danger that promoting "democracy" and "economic openness" with a heavy-hand will damage existing bilateral relationships in important areas such as stopping people-trafficking across the Mediterranean, promoting security and stability in the Middle East, and combating the illegal drugs trade.
Point:The changes in the political world, which occurred and are occurring at present in some Mediterranean states show that now more than ever the EU has a partner on their southern flank. The democratization of these states will make them stronger and more stable, which will be of economic and political advantage to the EU. Surely, this process will not be easy, but some of these countries already do have the basis for it.Many middle eastern states already have institutions that are similar to the representative institutions that a stable democracy needs. Arab dictators have grown adept at holding elections, setting up parliaments, constitutional courts etc. as window dressing to show either to their people or to the outside world that they are reforming and are 'democratic'. No matter how undemocratic these regimes have been the simple existence of these institutions is useful when there is a revolution as they allow some continuity and the possibility of a transition to democracy. To take Egypt as an example. Even under Mubarak it had a parliament with the Majilis Al-Sha'ab (People's Assembly) as its lower house and Majilis Al-Shura (Shura Council) as its upper house. In both houses a majority of the members are directly elected1. Egypt held elections for its parliament as recently as November 2010, these elections had very poor turnout and blatant ballot rigging while the main opposition the Muslim Brotherhood have to stand as independents2.
Counterpoint:What these countries have now as an election and governance systems is not at all close to democracy. Even if people voted, this only means they know the pure technical way, but are not familiar with the principal. You need to have lived and be educated in the spirit of democracy in order to fully grasp its sense. The fake world that the suppressors in the Arabic country have created does not have anything to do with a real democratic system. The ruling party used to allow opposition candidates to run and then simply rig the elections. before adopting a new strategy of preventing the opposition from fielding any candidates at all and harassing those who did1.
Point:A Union for the Mediterranean is an ideal foreign policy tool for the European Union. It works just as the EU has worked for over 50 years: by creating a permanent, institutionalized dialogue, the EU can draw strategic partners into real cooperation, not just the more formal procedures of diplomacy. The end goal is to enhance the interdependence of the EU and the other Mediterranean countries so much, that they would effectively become a single economic unit where sovereignty is pooled to solve shared problems.
Counterpoint:The economic interdependence of the EU and other Mediterranean countries doesn't need much enhancing. Already, the EU is the biggest trading partner of the other Mediterranean countries. A Union can't do much more to increase that dependence. As to political cooperation and foreign policy: the EU itself was originally intended to be an economic union, not a political union. Giving the EU a foreign policy tool like a Union for the Mediterranean is a step closer towards a European super-state, and should therefore in and of itself be rejected.
Point:A Union for the Mediterranean is a necessary foreign policy tool for the EU: it's the best way of dispelling the notion of a 'clash of civilizations'. By drawing the Islamic countries around the Mediterranean into a permanent dialogue on specific policy issues and increasing contacts and cooperation, policy makers and opinion leaders will get to know each other better, and learn how to see each other as partners, not enemies. A Union for the Mediterranean will eventually lead to a shared sense of community and respect, as has happened with Turkey.
Counterpoint:Even if there is such a thing as a 'clash of civilizations', a Union for the Mediterranean does nothing to dispel it. The mutual fear and distrust between peoples stems from cultural and ideological differences, and those can't be changed by having the elite policy makers sit together regularly in a talking shop. Moreover, it is unclear why cultural differences should be changed: the Mediterranean Arab/Islamic culture and the European Judeo-Christian are perfectly capable of co-existing peacefully. Lastly: the Union for the Mediterranean does nothing for the hardest problem in the Mediterranean: the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Point:It is a great opportunity for the EU to create partners in the Mediterranean right now. The EU should offset the dilatoriness of its response to the pro-democratic demands with a decided and generous involvement (in terms of funds, but principally of political will) in favour of democratic transitions. To do so, it should abandon an approach that is focused, on the one hand, on the 'securitisation' of Euro-Mediterranean relations and, on the other, on the belief that commercial and economic liberalisation will solve all the problems and bring about democracy and good governance. Stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean can be best achieved with the support of 'strong states' instead of 'fierce states', as has been the case until now. Actively fostering good governance in Arab countries will necessarily translate into new opportunities for societies and economies on both shores of the Mediterranean. To do this, it is all the more necessary to resume the objectives and the 'Barcelona spirit' of 19951, since its diagnosis was accurate, although there was a lack of political will, the context was adverse and the means were not tailored to meet the ends.
Counterpoint:There is an opportunity for the EU as a global actor to get involved in the current situation in the Arabic world. However it is not the only global actor. There is also the United States, which also have big interests in these specific areas. Such close partnership to be achieved means negotiating with one more, rather hidden part â€“ the USA. Until now they have had very close relations to the leaders in these regions and it is likely for them to continue maintaining close relationships with these countries due to the economic interest. The EU can find itself in a difficult situation if it gets driven in games of intrigues and political schemes.
