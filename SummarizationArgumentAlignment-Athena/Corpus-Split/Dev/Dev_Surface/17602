Point:The massive commercialisation of the Games erodes the idea of taking part for its own sake: with so much sponsorship money at stake, winning at all costs is the inevitable aim. The rule of the sponsors seems more important than the sport: interrupting television coverage of the events to advertise is symptomatic of this, permitting McDonalds to sponsor a sports event is another. As is the auctioning off of 'virtually every aspect of the Games to the highest bidder.'1 Whilst a recent report indicates that sport is still at the centre of the Olympics, 'the volume of commercial messages drowns out any competing narratives apart from sports' (Multinational Monitor, 2008, p.8). The Olympic Dream is that competing narrative attempting to weave the values of friendship, respect and excellence into the home viewer.
Counterpoint:Commercialization ensures that the Olympic Games are still "the" Games in which to compete. It is an amateur event, so by definition they are taking part for its own sake. Furthermore, a few breaks in coverage is a small price to pay for 3.5bn people to be able to see the Games, and thus be inspired to play sports: that was the number of viewers estimated for the Atlanta Games. The sponsors do not really have significant control over the running of the Games: Coca Cola's calls for IOC Chief Samaranch to be replaced were not met; IBM had to end its sponsorship of the Games because the IOC was asking for more than they could pay. The IOC has the stronger hand, and a wide choice of sponsors. Without any sponsorship, many of the poorer countries that are able at present to send a team to the Olympics would be unable to do so. Sponsorship, even a little, is the key to starting to put all countries on an equal footing.
Point:The use of performance-enhancing drugs is sufficiently common in the Olympics to be a cause of concern. Not only do they reduce the victories of those who take them to meaninglessness but they cast aspersions over the efforts of all other athletes. As Simon Barnes noted in Beijing in 2008, “the world is full of people declaring that they don’t care who wins what at the Olympics, because ‘they’re all on something’” (Barnes, 2008). New drugs such as the growth hormone EPO are very difficult to detect, and the Olympic authorities are not doing enough to overcome the problem – stirring the negative public opinion. Though the IOC claims to be clamping down on the drug problem, there were still 26 cases of doping at Athens in 2004, and 20 cases in Beijing (Allen, 2011), such cases only indicate the athletes taking known substances, or substances that can be tested for. The Olympic motto of ‘faster, higher, stronger’ is fatally undermined if athletes’ achievements are the result not of physical and mental strain, but chemical concoction.
Counterpoint:Despite some well-publicized cases of doping in previous Olympic games, the drug-testing technology is now sufficiently advanced to deter most athletes. The evidence bears witness to this change as the proposition's statistics indicate. The IOC is coming down hard on those who take drugs: a two year ban for the first offence has been introduced. It also plans to make London 2012 the 'most tested games ever', with over 5,000 individual tests, or roughly one for every two athletes (Allen, 2011). As such, there is very little chance of a doping athlete going undetected.
Point:The IOC and many national Olympic committees lack integrity, and this kills the Games' spirit and pretensions to fair play. Officials working for the Salt Lake City 2002 bid are believed to have spent more than $1 million on 'gifts and favors' for IOC members in an effort to bribe their way to the victory.1 Furthermore, in response to a BBC programme in 2010 which highlighted the corruption of members of FIFA, football's governing body, the IOC was forced to open an investigation into three of its own members who held posts at both organizations.2 The inability of the IOC to stamp out the corruption of its own members, or otherwise alter its voting system, reflects poorly on its commitment to excellence and fairness. If the IOC is charged with ensuring the propagation of the Olympic Dream, it is setting a poor example.
Counterpoint:The IOC has worked long and hard to ensure that the corruption that marred the 2002 voting process will not happen again. The six members at the centre of the scandal were recommended for expulsion, three resigned of their own accord, whilst others were warned (Mackay & Chaudhary, 1999). As IOC President Dick Pound stated at the time, 'the conduct of certain IOC members was contrary to everything the Olympic movement has grown to represent. It dishonours all those who believe in the Olympic Dream.'1 As such, The IOC made clear that the behaviour of those members was at odds with the Olympic Dream, and reformed itself accordingly. This does not demonstrate that the Olympic Dream is dead, merely that work needs to be done to ensure it is always maintained. That work is being done.
Point:The modern Olympic athlete is no longer driven 'for the glory of sport', but by an appetite for excellence that can, and often does, override any notion of fair-play or respect. The sense of fraternity that Olympic athletes once had is becoming lost in the antagonistic rivalries between nations and individual athletes and the pressure not merely to compete, but to win. We should have some sympathy with athletes sometimes: very often, they are compelled to take drugs by their team's coach. The Chinese swimming team, for example, was beset at Atlanta by claims that they had adopted a systematic and untraceable doping regime to improve their athletes, with remarkable results.1 To overcome this, the IOC Conference in February 1999 recommended that coaches should take the Olympic Oath as well as athletes, however the document itself is so tarnished by the regularity with which it is ignored that it is fast becoming a farce. The Olympics therefore may still be a great event, with many great athletes but it no longer carries the associations with respect and fair-play that made its Dream so appealing to so many.
Counterpoint:The Olympics was always about the ability of athletes, with the support of their coaches, to go to extreme lengths to win. It is a competition. Nonetheless, modern athletes have not lost the fraternity that has marked previous Olympic Games, nor have the millions of tourists that flock to all corners of the world to view their countrymen compete. Events are rarely troubled by disputes between competitors, winners and runners-up are congratulated by all, regardless of their national allegiances, and there are few troubles reported by tourists.
Point:The Olympics have been hijacked so many times for political purposes that competition "for the glory of sport" cannot help but have been smothered. The Munich disaster in 1972 is the most shocking: nine Israeli athletes were taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists and eventually killed. Yet the Games were only suspended for 34 hours; it is as if those who play the Games were less important than the spectacle of the Games. When the USA boycotted the 1980 Moscow Games, they devalued still further the supremacy of sport for its own sake. In 2008, a number of state leaders decided to boycott the Beijing Opening Ceremony in protest of the Chinese crackdown in Tibet.1 In so doing, they essentially pull the focus of the event away from the athletes and sport and use it instead as a political tool. That is not the purpose of an event founded specifically to grant athletes the platform to shine.
Counterpoint:The Olympics can be overshadowed by external political issues, but it can never interfere with the sport that is it's hallmark. Chapter Five of the Olympic Charter states explicitly 'no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in the Olympic areas. Nevertheless, even when politics has been brought into the arena itself, notably in 1968 in Mexico City when two black American athletes gave the Black Power salute on the podium, it has been at the behest of the athletes themselves. This has ensured that the Olympics has maintained about the sport and the athletes, not the states they represent.
