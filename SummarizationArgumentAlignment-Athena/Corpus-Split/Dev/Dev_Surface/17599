Point:Children do not have the emotional maturity to be responsible in law for their actions. We all know that children cannot always make informed decisions. It is for this reason that children in many countries cannot vote or drink alcohol or consent to sex. Children have not had enough experience of life and do not yet have the same mental and emotional abilities as adults. They are often not aware of the consequences of their actions. Even where they know the difference between right and wrong, they often don't understand the difference between various levels of wrongdoing. It is therefore unfair to hold them criminally responsible for these actions. See for example the case of two boys (of 10 and 11) convicted of raping an 8 year old girl; there was a suggestion that they believed they were only playing a game, and did not understand the importance of what happened.11 BBC, "Two boys guilty of attempted rape charges in London", May 2010, [2]
Counterpoint:In short, some children do realise the difference between right and wrong. Where a majority of children at a certain age do understand that difference, it is right to prosecute them. Furthermore, ignorance of the law cannot be taken to be a defence as an adult; when someone has the capacity to understand that theft, violence etc. is wrong, how can it be right to allow them to go unpunished should they commit such an offence?
Point:We should address these circumstances rather than punishing them. Studies show that they are often vulnerable children who have grown up in poverty, been uncared for by their parents, moved house a lot, been abused, been victims or members of gang activity, and often skipped school. Rather than sending these children to young offender institutes, often harming their education and training them to be criminals, we should take other measures. As in Norway, for example, social authorities should take action to secure the child's development through counselling or time in a special care unit. Measures should depend of the child's circumstances, rather than how bad their crime was. This is more likely to reduce criminal behaviour in the future. In addition, there are issues about 'class' here. Rich children are less likely to be criminalised because their parents can deal better with the situation and pay for better lawyers.1 Council of Europe, "Youth Policy in Norway", 2004,(From Page 57) [3]
Counterpoint:While this may be true, some of the measures that may be ideal are, as suggested below, ones that require a finding of guilt. For example, it would be considered wrong to place a supervision order on someone who had not committed a crime; such an order would therefore not be available to rehabilitate a criminal.
Point:Given the serious consequences of being found guilty, it is important that people have a fair trial to find out whether they are guilty and to make sure any punishment is just. Children often struggle to understand the trial process which may be long, technical and stressful. Children are unlikely to have the concentration to follow the evidence properly and may not be able to give clear and consistent instructions to their lawyers. This can lead to great injustice if the child cannot adequately follow the trial because they do not understand, or are intimidated by, the strange setting and the language used. For example, in the Jamie Bulger case (see above), it was noted that throughout much of the three week trial the boys looked bewildered and bored, and that neither boy gave evidence.11 Wikipedia, "Murder of James Bulger" [7]
Counterpoint:There are measures that can be taken to limit the unfairness of the trial; lawyers can limit the formality of the atmosphere, evidential rules can be used to limit the importance of not testifying and using short sessions can ensure that children can participate. The difficulty of a trial is no excuse for not trying to do it to the best of the justice system's ability. Furthermore, the judge and the jury are capable of assessing the evidence, and ensuring the process is fair.
Point:Criminalising children harms their development and makes the situation worse. Being labelled as a criminal at a very young age is unlikely to lead to a better understanding of right and wrong. Instead, a child who does not understand the wrongfulness of what they have done may feel unjustly treated and feel bitter toward society. Or the child might simply accept the label of being criminal and resign themselves to it. Children who are labelled criminals are also likely to be treated worse by those around them, such as teachers or other parents, separating them from society. In addition, those sent to prison or young offender institutes are cut off from their friends and family and develop friendships with other criminals, possibly even sharing ideas about crimes. All of these reactions are likely to make the child's situation worse and increase the chance of future criminal behaviour.
Counterpoint:While this is true in some cases, there are other sentences aside from prison or young offender institutes (see Opposition Argument Three below). In particular, some supervision orders may in fact aid supervision, while labelling can be avoided by using more neutral language (as is used in UK Youth Courts). Rehabilitation can be harmed by not using some of the tools of justice.
