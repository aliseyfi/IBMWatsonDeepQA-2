Point:Under FPTP, party representatives can focus on the concerns of 30% or so of citizens on whose vote they rely on for re-election. This results in tribal politics. AV, in forcing MPs to gain 50% of votes, forces them to consider those outside their core voters.
Counterpoint:AV does little to empower voters as they must still choose between the main political parties. Each party chooses a candidate who is then appointed to/imposed upon an area. Voters who like the party but dislike the candidate face a difficult decision.
Point:The current FPTP system is undemocratic; currently a majority government can be created with a minority of the vote, because MPs are elected with less than 50% of the vote, lending their decisions little legitimacy. "According to figures from the Electoral Reform Society, 434 MPs [of 650] received less than 50 per cent of the vote" at the 2010 General Election1 which means the majority of their constituents did not vote for them. AV ensures that elected representatives have the support the majority of their candidates because they have to get more than 50% of the vote. This gives a stronger democratic mandate to those who are elected.
Counterpoint:The Alternative Vote often prevents the most popular candidate from winning. In a race with several contenders, one may be far more popular with the voters than any other, gaining perhaps 40% of first preference votes while the next candidate might be 20% behind them. But quite often as less popular candidates are eliminated, their second and lower-preference votes don't go to the leading contender and the eventual winner ends up being an inoffensive centrist who was few citizens' first choice.1
Point:Under the FPTP electoral system, supporters of minority parties either waste their vote to support their ideals, or decide which of the leading parties they dislike lease and vote accordingly. Research reported by the British Academy indicates that 15% of people voted for a party other than their most preferred in the 2005 general election.1 This leaves voters unhappy at having to vote for the lesser of two evils. This also perpetuates the tradition two-party politics in the UK, as it makes it hard for a third party to gain enough votes to break through nationally. "Under AV there would be no technical reason for voting tactically for your most preferred candidate."2 AV allows voters to express their preferences honestly, as their first preference vote can be a protest vote for a minority party; when that is inevitably eliminated, their mainstream vote will still contribute to the result. AV encourages positive voting.
Counterpoint:"With AV the old game of tactical voting is not put away, it just has new rules".1 AV does eliminate tactical voting as voters who wish to maximise the impact of their preferences must second-guess each other. They will have to rank all the parties on their card in an order which prevents those parties they dislike most from getting elected.
Point:Unlike other proportional representation systems the alternative vote is easy to implement when changing from first past the post. This is because AV does not represent a very large change in terms of how the voting system would work. AV keeps the same constituencies so MPs and candidates would be competing for the same votes they have always done. Voters would remain in the same constituency so preventing any confusion that would be involved in a fully proportional system. The relative small change and therefore the ease to implement can be shown by the relatively small changes had the 2010 general election been fought under AV. Labour would have won ten fewer seats, the Conservatives twenty three less and Liberal Democrats thirty two more.1
Counterpoint:It is not changes in the constituencies that makes AV difficult to implement, it is the voter education that is necessary when changing the system. More than a third of voters believe that AV is hard to understand and if the voters do not understand the system the system will not work.1
Point:Nobody disputes the fact that extreme right and left parties should be allowed representation if they can gain the support of a large enough section of the voting public. Irrespective of their views, parties must all be given an equal chance of representation. 'Better' democracy must include extremism. However, AV makes it much less likely that extremist parties will be elected, as they are unlikely to get the required 50% support, instead of the 25-30% they currently need if support for opposing parties is split.
Counterpoint:Baroness Warsi, co-Chairman of the Conservative party, gave a speech on March 30th which summed up the ‘No’ campaign’s perspective on AV. She said that “under AV, voters would be able to register a protest vote without considering the electoral implications – and then transfer back to a mainstream party.” This means “more people backing fringe parties because they feel they can”.
