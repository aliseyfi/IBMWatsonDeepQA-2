Point:In many religions and cultures the role of the mother is a sacred one. The bible, specifically in scriptures Timothy 5:14 and Titus 2: 4-5, focuses on women’s role as ‘keepers of the house’, who should bear children and raise them in the way of the lord. In Proverbs 31: 28-31 women as a whole are praised for the successful raising of children and home, and as such this role is valued more than a mother working. In the Quran, mothers are regarded highly (e.g. 17:23, 31:14, 46:15). The prophet Muhammad even stated that 'Paradise lies at the feet of your mother'. The Islamic Scholar Majmoo' Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawwi'ah explains that within the Quran ‘She [the mother] is to be given precedence over and above the father’. Yet for a mother to earn this regard, she must stay in the home above all else, and this involves not gaining employment outside the home when caring for children. Hindu scriptures similarly often state that one must worship his or her mother first (Vanparva313.60, Apastamba Dharmsutra i.10.28.9). Thus for many religions the role of mother is sacred. This means that the woman should be viewed as privileged and valued as a housemother, a god-given position that is not available to the father.
Counterpoint:Scripture is out of date when it comes to issues of women’s rights and responsibilities no matter how sacred they may consider the role of motherhood. Focusing on the traditional stereotyped role of mother as the primary care giver is extremely restrictive for women. It is such religious beliefs that have meant that social prejudice is so developed world wide that even when women are given the option of letting the fathers care for the children, they often feel that this is not really a possibility. This severely limits a woman’s freedom of opportunities, and is likely to restrict her future employment prospects. As both partners have created their child, it is only just that the care of the child is assumed to be shared unless other issues, such as finance, change this position.Regarding the importance of maternal breast-feeding, few mothers breastfeed for longer than the period allowed for paid maternity leave in many countries. This is therefore not an argument for their staying at home for longer than the period of leave.
Point:The BBC has previously recorded that in the UK childcare options are often unaffordable, and families with two working parents are often not much better off than families with one working parent (October 2003) 1. There is more recent evidence of this from Aviva’s Family Finances Report in 2011, which found ‘parents questioning whether they can both afford to work, due to the high cost of childcare 2. Workingmums.net reports a similar situation in the USA, and from anecdotal evidence, such as a number of blogs, it appears this situation is common worldwide. If this is the case, then maybe it is logical for mothers to save on childcare costs and give up their own work.
Counterpoint:Childcare teaches children to socialise at an early age, and some are state sponsored. Places such as nursery/playschool or any form of group child care actually teaches children social skills, such as how to share toys with other children, how to make friends and how to cope without their parents for a short time at least1, and this is a happy, informal and easy way for children to learn these skills. Kathy Sylvia disputes the research illustrated by Biddulph and claims that after the age of two, and in good nurseries, children are no more likely to become aggressive than those who were looked after by a fulltime housemother. She also claims that in the cases where aggression levels are higher, this is usually dispelled by the age of 11. She bases her findings on the Effective Provision of Pre-School Education project, 2004 (explained further in scrapbook).
Point:Mothers who stay at home benefit society as a whole. The money that they save on childcare can be spent in other areas such as pensions, healthcare, or environmental issues.
Counterpoint:Finally, why is it better for mothers to spend time outside the home volunteering rather than in paid work if we are concerned about the impact of separation from the mother on the child? Surely one is as harmful, or not, as the other? If mothers aren’t working and earning a living, where are they going to find the money for pensions, healthcare costs and environmental issues? Furthermore, if more women were working, then the state would have more funds from tax. Therefore the state would equally have more money to spend on these issues if more women worked than if women stayed at home to look after the children. If mothers work for a living, they can engage in society more directly through their job, and they can use the money that they earn to make a real difference in their community. The money that is earned by a working parent typically offsets the costs associated with childcare so leaving the children in a similarly well off situation1.
Point:Early childhood is the most influential period in a child’s development 1. It is in this period that a child learns which social rules are to be obeyed and how emotions, such as anger, are expressed. Also it is the period of time when ‘attachment’ begins (see ‘attachment theory’ authors such as Donald Winnicott or John Bowlby, also discussed in ‘scrapbook’ below), and many psychologists believe this attachment is essential to normal social and emotional development in the child 2. Therefore the more time the mother spends with the child at this time, the stronger this attachment will be. Mothers who stay at home can ensure their children get the best possible start in life. They can help the child learn how to appropriately express emotions, and create a loving bond. This bond will ensure that they know what their children are doing, how to make them happy, and when something is wrong.
Counterpoint:Attachment studies have actually shown that the best relationship occurs when the child accepts the fact that the mother will leave, but also knows she will return, and welcomes her when she does. If the mother never leaves the child there is no time for this belief to develop and the process of developing healthy behaviour concerning the mother's absence will be delayed.Furthermore, some of the studies referred to by the proposition, e.g., Bowlby were based on very limited or inappropriate evidence e.g., children wholly separated from their mothers in institutions.
