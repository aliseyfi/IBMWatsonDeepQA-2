Point:Integration is something that is already happening due to the existence of Creoles. Bryson (1991) states that, "According to Dr Loreto Todd of Leeds University, the world has sixty-one creoles (languages that are a mix of two different ones, such as the many different Pidgins spoken around the world) spoken by up to 200 million people." Creole languages are the ultimate form of language integration, and most would argue that this isn't language death, and can in fact enhance the culture through the new language.
Counterpoint:Creoles aren't an example of language integration.Creoles are simply a natural shift in the language, and not necessarily a complete overhaul and integration, for example English itself became 'Frenchified' after the Norman Conquest, but it is still far removed from the French language we know today.
Point:The world is becoming increasingly more and more globalised and a common language of communication is necessary to help this continue. Countries are more interdependent than ever and with the advances that we have seen in technology in the last few decades, communication is instantaneous. For us to be able to effectively communicate, especially within fields such as international trade and economics, as well as diplomacy, a common working language is key. McDonalds for example have almost thirty three thousand branches in almost every country in the world1 within such big global companies communication is essential. Not surprisingly these multi-national companies increasingly opt for English as their corporate language regardless of where the company originally comes from, for example Japanese based Rakuten is to make English its company language from 20122.1 Dean Praetorius, Subway Passes McDonald's To Become The World's Largest Restaurant Chain, The Huffington Post, 7th March 2011, [1]2 Ulara Nakagawa, Unconventional Rakuten, The-Diplomat, 12th May 2011 [2]
Counterpoint:The world today demonstrates that globalisation can occur even without a global language. McDonalds has obviously not been hindered by having to speak different languages in different countries. As a company that employs people on low wages and is based on a franchise system there is no need for employees to be able to speak a global language to be able to serve their local customers. Meanwhile in international relations, speaking a guest country's language is generally seen as good manners; even from tourists.
Point:The United Nations already has universal education high up the priority list. The second millennium development goal is to achieve universal primary education and to 'ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling'. Universal schooling is the key to teaching a global language. This does not mean that children will be forced to learn a global language, but because of the utility of the language most will want to when they are given the opportunity. The global spread of English encourages non-native speakers to learn a second language; English. Without English, a second language would only slightly increase the number of people you could communicate with. With English (or, if it ever takes off, Esperanto!) there is a stronger incentive to learn the single language that will dramatically improve your ability to communicate with others around the world.
Counterpoint:It will be difficult and impractical to make everyone learn the same language.Picking just one language disadvantages those whose languages are replaced especially if they are unable or unwilling to use the new language. It would be extremely practically difficult and expensive to teach everyone the new language, especially when literacy levels, even in their own language are very low in some countries. Those without good enough language skills may find it hard to get a job at all, thereby disadvantaging those without access to good education, something that is seen in countries where knowledge of English is becoming essential, such as Spain.
Point:Poetry and other significant literary works could be translated into English so that everyone can enjoy them. This would be equally true of scientific and technical information as well as teaching staff and institutions. Most popular classical works are translated into other languages without loss of meaning e.g. poems of Robert Burns from the original Scots into English. And why would we purposely want to make it difficult for people to understand each other? Surely understanding each other is more important than learning about their culture but not being able to converse whatsoever. This would have immense benefits for science as researchers all over the world would be able to understand each other's work.
Counterpoint:Translation is not always successful in preserving ideas or literary constructions meaning cultural diversity may be lost. Translating works into English could be seen as another form of cultural genocide. This is particularly true of poetry (the works of Shakespeare for example), where local dialects and word sounds are essential to the understanding of the piece. However many new works a global language would provide access to, true appreciation is best gained from studying them in the language in which they were written. By reducing the use of other languages we risk cutting people off from historical documents and literature in their old languages, works which often carry emotional or religious significance. Understanding of some languages may be lost altogether if they are not spoken every day.
Point:Translation is very expensive, but while there is no common language also necessary. All sorts of documents have to be translated into several languages even within countries, for example UK councils provide information on their activities in the major minority languages within their area. With a global language this will be cheaper and quicker as well as reducing the potential for misunderstanding. The European Union is the big example of this with all documents needing to be translated into every member state's language. The total bill for the EU in translation fees was €800 million in 2004, that's €2 per citizen1.
Counterpoint:Not translating causes its own problems.Meaning is given to words by their cultural context rather than a dictionary definition. This means people from different cultures may use the same word to mean different things in different contexts, even when speaking the same language. Crucial cultural distinctions maybe overlooked if translation is no longer considered. It would also be much more expensive to create a new language, and to make everyone learn it (e.g. Esperanto), and international organizations seem work perfectly fine with translating. Misunderstanding from having different meanings from the same words would be as great as the translation costs.
