Point:Although historically developed to finance wars, the estate tax is an important continuing source of revenue for the U.S. budget. If its repeal was made permanent from 2010, then more than $1 trillion would be lost to the federal government over ten years. And remember that when the 2001 Act for reducing and eventually repealing the estate tax was passed, the US federal budget was in surplus and government spending was under control. Since then a range of Republican tax cuts and spendthrift expenditure have sent the budget into heavy deficit, while the ongoing costs of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to be heavy. Given that the aging of the baby boomer generation poses huge costs for the USA in terms of health care, social security benefits, and a worsening dependency ratio, abolishing the estate tax is a luxury America cannot afford. Moreover, as Theodore Roosevelt pointed out in 1906, 'the man of great wealth owes a particular obligation to the state because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government'11 Results.

Counterpoint:Historically, estate taxes have only been enacted to raise money in times of war. These taxes were repealed soon after the war, therefore they are not important sources of revenue, they are merely emergency sources of revenue. The estate tax should have been repealed following the end of WWI. And if the objection is to wasteful government expenditure, then the only way to cut back the size of government is to reduce the amount it has to spend. Only by restricting the tax take can politicians be forced to cut unnecessary or wasteful programs. The estate tax is a good choice of revenue to cut, as it is not only unfair and economically-distorting, it is also associated with high compliance costs, requiring an expensive government bureaucracy and a whole death-tax planning industry to operate it. Furthermore, as economists like Martin Feldstein argue, 'when the incentive effects of the tax are taken into account, the net impact of the estate tax is probably to reduce overall tax revenue'1. This is because it merely induces wealthy individuals to make large charitable gifts to reduce the revenue loss caused by the estate tax1. Ultimately therefore, the estate tax as public policy is fatally flawed and undermines its very intention.1 Feldstein, M. (n.d.). Kill the Death Tax Now...

Point:The estate tax is a progressive tax that promotes economic equality by taxing the rich more than the poor. It acknowledges that luck, circumstance, and family contribute to wealth along with hard work, creativity, and sacrifice. Only about 2% of Americans, the very wealthiest, actually pay estate taxes because there is a high initial exemption level (rising to $3.5 million in 2009) below which nothing is paid. This means that even the very rich pay only a small percentage of the value of their entire estate - if you died in 2009 leaving an estate worth $5 million, only the $1.5 million above the threshold would actually pay any estate tax. Furthermore, the need to reduce economic inequality has never been greater; in the United States the gap between the earnings of the top fifth and the bottom fifth has jumped 50% since 19801. Therefore, the estate tax is vital in preventing the emergence of a 'hereditary upper class' that would institutionalise wealth and prevent its dispersal to those who work the hardest and deserve the greatest reward1.1 Mallaby, S.

Counterpoint:The Estate Tax does not encourage economic equality, for it unfairly targets those who pour more of their money into the growth of their businesses, creating jobs, new technologies whilst ignoring those who blow their wealth on holidays and luxury parties1. Specifically it targets family farms and family-owned businesses, often leading to their dissolution. This is because the tax is levied on the value of the farm estate, or the business as a whole, but these are not liquid assets (quickly convertible into cash). In order to pay the Treasury the death tax sum demanded, the land has to be broken up and much of it sold, or the business has to be sold (often below its true market value as it is a forced sale) to generate cash. As President Bush proclaimed in 2005, 'in order to make sure our farms stay within our farming families, we need to get rid of the death tax once and for all'. If fairness is the objective, there can be no fairer result than a son or daughter inheriting the land and business of his father.1 Mankiw, G. (2006, June 5). The Estate Tax Debate.

Point:The estate tax creates an incentive to leave money to charitable causes, as any sum left to a charity is exempt from the tax calculations. This allows rich individuals to exercise choices as to where their fortune goes after their death, rather than leaving it to the federal government to decide, but the whole of society still benefits. In this way the estate tax underpins the whole tradition of American philanthropy which does so much to enrich social, educational, cultural and environmental areas of national life. A study on the effect of the estate tax on charitable giving found that 'estate tax repeal would have significant deleterious effects on charitable bequests and giving during life'. In 2001, 301 decedents with gross estates in excess of $20 million gave $6.8 million to charity, accounting for 42% of all charitable bequests1.1 Bakija, J. M., & Gale, W. G. (2003, June 23).

Counterpoint:The only incentive the estate tax creates is to try and prevent money going into the state treasury. It distorts estate planning, as rich individuals seek to use accountants, lawyers and specialist consultants to avoid paying money unnecessarily to the federal government. This is not only expensive, it also results in productive assets (e.g. businesses) being run-down or liquidated so that money can be put into trusts, insurance policies, tax free investments, etc. in the hope of reducing liabilities. The result of this is that financial affairs become much more complicated and generally less productive in terms of future income growth.
Point:The estate tax prevents the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, avoiding a plutocracy (government by a wealthy ruling class). It allows the pursuit of the American dream by limiting the power of "old money." Repealing the estate tax would also widen the gap between the poor and the wealthy, and could fuel the kind of class envy that would really threaten the property-owning American capitalism that so favours the wealthy. In any case, do we really want to create a class of idle rich who have done nothing themselves to create wealth, but merely inherited it? Would it even be good for the inheritors if this happened? Much better for the government to use some of these windfalls to help give every American child a decent chance in life, for example through better funding for education, health, etc.The estate tax prevents the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, avoiding a plutocracy (government by a wealthy ruling class).

Counterpoint:It is the wealthy who drive the economy as a whole, therefore taxing the wealthy does not prevent concentration, rather it prevents the accumulation of wealth for all. There would be no wealth whatsoever without the hard work, savings and prudent investment of those who will be most targeted by the estate tax. The prospect of not being able to hand over your lifetime's work intact to your heirs creates a huge disincentive to work hard building up a family farm or business, and so is bad for the economy as a whole. And even if higher exemptions mean few farms or businesses are subject to the death tax today, who can predict how future values will rise? Many businessmen will avoid expanding their company in order to keep below the exemption threshold– and that means new jobs won’t be created and the government won’t benefit from increased corporate and income tax payments. Better to repeal the whole tax.
