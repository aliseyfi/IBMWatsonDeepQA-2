Point:It is a widely known fact that a large proportion of the money made from selling lottery tickets goes directly to good causes and schemes run by the government to help improve the lives of the people who buy the tickets in the first place. The National Lottery (UK) was initially founded on the principle of providing funding for the arts, sport and heritage with funding for projects that would not otherwise get off the ground, and in recent years there has been a drive by the government to return the distribution of lottery money to those causes1. According to the official National Lottery website, "Camelot already runs the most cost-efficient lottery in Europe - an achievement that has helped the UK National Lottery to generate over Â£26 billion for the Good Causes, and counting"2. This is an incredible sum of money, made possible by the fact that government endorsement allows for greater awareness of the competition meaning more players and more money going to charity. Were the lottery to be de-nationalised, there would be no guarantee of these essential donations - the lottery would simply become another form of gambling which profits the organisers above all else.
Counterpoint:They don't always give as much as they say they can. A BBC News article from 2001 highlights how changeable the positive aspects of the National Lottery in the UK can be1. Governmental involvement is also a drain on the possible resources that could be donated to good causes. There is no denying that the money donated is a good thing, but why should the government take a 12% cut of the profits2 on top of the running costs of the system. If the government was to be removed from the process whilst maintaining the legislation that ensures the donations to good causes then that 12% (which works out as a very large amount of money) could also go to the good causes. If people do indeed buy their tickets in the knowledge that a lot of their money is going to help people, they would surely rather it go to those causes rather than the government. The argument for lotteries based on their charitable successes are of course fundamentally flawed - the tickets are purchased with the aim to win the game, not to give to charity. If people were to donate the same amount of money directly to the causes they inadvertently benefit, they would have almost the same chance of winning millions whilst benefiting the charities and schemes even more.1 Talking Point.

Point:Governmental involvement is essential in ensuring that a large proportion of the money goes to help the public. For example, the London 2012 Olympics will receive around 2.2 billion pounds1, providing funding for buildings such as the main Olympic Stadium. Without the National Lottery then, the Olympic Games would have been much more expensive for the taxpayer, and the country would not be able to put on the spectacle it now plans to. This is just one example of how government regulation in lotteries can ensure that the profits raised go where they are needed - people are not paying any extra to help fund projects such as the Olympic Games, but by choosing to buy a lottery ticket the government ensures that some of that money goes to useful projects.1 National Lottery.

Counterpoint:That this is a voluntary purchase does not negate it as a tax. The Olympic Games do not benefit the vast majority of the people who buy lottery tickets. Robert K. Barney points out in The New York Times that the benefits are short term - "such an endeavor is fleeting and the monuments built for the spectacle in the form of stadiums and sporting venues shortly become little more than ghostly reminders of once glorious days"1. Andrew Zimbalist points out in the same article that, "Montreal's 1976 Olympics left the city with $2.7 billion of debt that it finally paid off in 2005" - there is no guarantee that the money spent from the lottery fund will in fact be economically beneficial to anyone. Governmental promotion and interference in lotteries can as such move money away from potentially more deserving causes to provide a temporary boost in popularity from the general public. Ultimately the question comes down to whether or not the money made has benefits beyond the moral issues involved in gambling. While there are positives to lottery funded projects, the distribution of these funds could never be truly fair, and they will continue to benefit a minority rather than the individuals that actually purchase tickets.1 New York Times.

Point:There is no getting round the fact that the amounts of money involved in most lottery systems are life changing. They are the one way in which those who are of average or low income to gain immense wealth and alter their quality of life for the better. There is good documentation of how much these people's lives are changed1 - governmental involvement in this activity has no negative impacts on the individuals playing the game - indeed their regulation means that the revenue generated goes to more deserving causes than would happen were the lotteries to be privately regulated.1 National Lottery. (n.d.). Where the money goes. Retrieved June 20, 2011, from The National Lottery: [5]
Counterpoint:Of all the people who do play the lottery, a tiny minority ever win a life-changing sum of money. The system encourages a culture in which people assume that they can gain the rewards of wealth and success without actually being successful, and of course in the vast majority of cases this is utterly misguided. Studies have also shown that people who are, or at least feel that they are less well-off are far more likely to play lotteries1 - they therefore create a culture of false hope among poorer people, and also encourage them to waste what little money they have on something that is of no use to them. Government promotion of such a socially selective form of tax is as such unacceptable.1 Levin, S. (2008, July 25). Poverty leads to playing lottery.

Point:If there exists a mechanism, like the national lottery, whereby a government can raise its revenue outside of having to directly tax its population, it is obligated to do so. Direct taxation is a burden on the population, reducing discretionary spending; therefore governments should constantly be seeking to placate its populations by reducing the proportion of state revenue that comes from direct taxation. A study by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries found that lottery sales raised $52.6 billion for states in 20051. If the state's obligation is to look after the general interest of its population, which lie in lower direct tax rates as a proportion of total revenue, such a lucrative revenue stream cannot be ignored at the expense of maintaining direct tax rates.
Counterpoint:Governments should not seek alternative revenue streams that permit a circumvention of the traditional, fairer direct tax methods. Direct taxation ensures, generally, that those able to pay proportionally more tax, do so. To reduce the proportion of government or state revenue that comes from such methods, in favour of a national lottery, means that those less able to pay are thereafter contributing a greater percentage of overall government revenue than they should be in an equitable system. Therefore, a national lottery does not serve anyone's interest but the states, for they can claim to be reducing direct tax on all tax bands, however in effect they are merely asking the less well-off to contribute proportionally more to the state coffers. Even if everyone spent the same on a lottery ticket each week, the fact that the majority of the population lie in the middle to lower tax brackets means that they thereafter are contributing more than they should be.
