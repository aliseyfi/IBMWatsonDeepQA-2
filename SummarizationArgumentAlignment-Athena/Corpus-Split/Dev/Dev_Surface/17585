Point:The foreign policy of the United States was first conceived as being one of strict isolationism. Since the time of George Washington, who warned against the risks of entangling alliances with foreign powers, American foreign policy has been based squarely in the principles of non-interventionism1. By pursuing this course the United States was able to avoid involvement in the ruinous wars of Europe that wracked that continent during the 18th and 19th centuries, sapping their strength and ultimately bringing about the downfalls of their far-flung empires. During those same years the United States was able to focus on its own growth, fighting only when its own vital interests were at stake, and pushed its borders from being just a small nation on the Eastern coast of the North American continent to the point whereby it was a continent-spanning giant1. It was only during World War One that the United States broke with its long tradition of non-entanglement with foreign powers, and its involvement in that conflict led it to be embroiled in the foreign intrigues and power games that made the 20th and early 21st centuries ones of almost constant American involvement in wars; wars that were always in far-flung locales in which the United States' vital interests did not truly lie. In order to escape the entanglements of the international system, the United States must seek to disengage itself and to pursue once again a policy of concern for its own interests without concern for the happenings of other states.
Counterpoint:What made the United States great was not specifically its isolationist philosophy, but its awareness of which philosophy is best suited to its place in international society. As such, pursuing an isolationist policy now will not make the United States strong just because it did so in the past. The international landscape has fundamentally changed since the birth of the United States, and even since the end of the World Wars. The increased interconnectedness of people between nations through politics and markets is unprecedented in history and cannot simply be ignored. By turning its back on the international system the United States only hampers its own development and success.
Point:Popular opinion in the United States has been shifting more and more toward preference for non-interventionist and isolationist foreign policy. People in the United States are tired of the costs of foreign adventures, in both lives and wealth, and have been clamoring as of late for a return to a more traditional foreign policy. This is amply demonstrated in the rise of the Tea Party movement and its success in the 2010 congressional election1. The Tea Party has been fighting for a less intrusive, smaller government, and demand that state spending be reined in and the massive deficit dealt with. There is no better way to accomplish this aim than reducing American involvement in foreign conflicts and in its large military presence around the world2. By pursuing a policy of non-interventionism, the United States will be able to bring its finances back in order by not spending so heavily on defense, while also allowing domestic production to increase through protectionism of domestic business.
Counterpoint:Current popular sentiment does not support isolationism. Average American citizens do not consider a total withdrawal from the international system a good idea. Even the most rabid supporters of the Tea Party movement do not support so drastic a move. The current political climate calls for rethinking how much the government should do for people and how much it should spend, not whether or not the United States should be involved in the international system.
Point:The United States has at its disposal the most powerful military in history, and is comparatively more powerful than any single state has been in history. Yet its forces are stretched thin across the globe and embroiled in ongoing conflicts in several regions, particularly its seemingly endless wars in the Middle East1. The cost of such military output and the number of soldiers stationed on over 800 military bases around the world is unsustainable. The United States must focus its defense policy on the protection of its own borders and its own people rather than getting involved with the problems of other states as it has done in recent years. Behaving as the world's police has served to provide many countries with the public good of international security, allowing them to scale back their own military spending and letting the United States pick up the slack. Yet its behavior has not earned it approbation, but rather the ire of many parts of the international community, as well as that of terrorist groups who see the United States as an imperialist oppressor. The growing economic cost of this international security provision, along with the domestic security threats created by it create the risk that the United States could collapse under the pressure, as so many powerful states have done in the past; just as Rome fell due to its stretching its resources too thin, so too might the United States2. By pursuing a policy of isolationism, the United States can spend less while providing superior security for its own citizens. Its technological and military superiority will not be affected by such a move, but will rather simply be more efficiently utilized. With a military dedicated to the protection of the United States and its narrow national interests, it can project power around the world without the huge costs of the current system.
Counterpoint:The United States is not suffering from imperial overstretch. If the costs of certain kinds of military activity are costly, it can always alter them. In fact, as time has progressed, its military has become more focused on drones and other less expensive tools of warfare. Withdrawing from the international system entirely will not save the United States from collapse, but will only destabilize the world order and cause it more danger.
Point:The United States has spent the last several decades trying to promote its ideals around the world by, among other things, offering support to fledgling democracies and democratic movements, staging humanitarian interventions to end tyranny and oppression, and offering extensive foreign aid packages to weaker economies struggling to develop. All of these activities have put the United States into a state of almost constant conflict. Its interventions in Korea, Vietnam, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and others have proven costly in both blood and treasure1. For all its efforts, the United States has gained little in terms of material benefits for its own people. Yet the first duty of a state is to its own people. By adopting a position of isolationism, the United States can place its focus on protecting its own people. Instead of getting caught up in entangling alliances that lead to unnecessary foreign wars, the United States can follow a path of peace and self-sufficiency that will allow its people to be free of the costs and horrors of war and international intrigue2. On the level of principle, it is the duty of the United States government to be isolationist, because only in that way can it fulfill its true duty which is to maintaining the safety of its people.
Counterpoint:The United States sole duty is not just to its own people. Rather, it has a duty as a member of the international community to contribute to the stability of global security and commerce. No country can truly isolate itself from the rest of the world, especially in the light of the inexorable movement of markets toward globalization. The United States has a role, as does every state in the international structure, which it must not abrogate.
Point:The United States has become economically dependent upon the productive capacities of other states, leaving it vulnerable to their influence and machinations. Its reliance upon China to produce much of its consumer goods and upon the Middle East for oil, have resulted in a major trade imbalance that is only growing. The trade deficit was $50.2billion in May 2011 with China alone making up $25 billion of this1. Eventually China, and, other net exporters to the United States will be able to pull its economic strings, and thus dominate it politically. For the United States to retain its political and economic autonomy, it must rein in its overactive spending as well as its borrowing from abroad. The only way to accomplish this is through a policy promoting domestic self-sufficiency by means of raising trade barriers with states and firms abroad. Through a regime of protective tariffs and forced trade balancing, the United States can expand domestic industries and rebuild those that have atrophied due to foreign competition. It is through such policies that it can restore itself to the position of a net exporter and escape the economic invasion of foreign powers2. The result of an isolationist policy for the economy will be a more self-sufficient nation with domestic industries capable of providing for the needs of its citizens, and one not dependent on any other state for vital commodities. The United States is particularly well suited to such an enterprise due to its immense size and wealth in resources and human capital. There is no need for such damaging economic relations as it has pursued, as allowing itself to be tied into the international economic system only exposes it to the machinations of unfriendly foreign powers and also makes it susceptible to contagion effects of economic crises in international markets. Clearly, the wise path is for America to protect its own economic interests through protectionism and isolationism.
Counterpoint:The United States has not been made vulnerable by its deep involvement in the international economic system. Rather, it has only been strengthened by the ability to enjoy the fruits of the comparative advantages that other states have in the production of certain goods and services. As the United States becomes more dependent on other countries, so too do they become more dependent on it.
