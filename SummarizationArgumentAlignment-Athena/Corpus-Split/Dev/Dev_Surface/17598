Point:Since Sputnik was launched in 1957, the space race has given rise to an infrastructure, particularly in the United States and Russia, which can be exploited for economies of scale. The cost of developing shuttles and training astronauts is far cheaper in Cape Carnarvon where the necessary equipment and skills lie to do so. Furthermore, the International Space Station costs upwards of $100 billion, however it serves as a terminal where shuttles can thereafter be pointed to any corner of the universe1. The potential therefore is to save costs by using the existence of the ISS as a stepping stone to elsewhere. To not use fifty years of space development and technology is to render all that investment meaningless.1 Kaku, M. (2009, July 16) The Cost of Space Exploration.

Counterpoint:If only it were true. The typical shuttle mission to the International Space Station costs $500-700 million. Private individuals, space tourists, have managed it for just $20 million a head1. Therefore, there is little in the argument that the existing space infrastructure is driving costs down. Furthermore, whilst the ISS has been justified as a terminal for the shuttles, the shuttles themselves have been justified as means to reach the space shuttle; a circular argument that offers little hope to the space explorer. Moreover, despite over fifty years of investment, NASA specifically has maintained a shuttle program at the expense of new materials, new fuels and innovative concepts1. As such, the technology has not advanced significantly since the original missions to the Moon between 1969 and 1972. The infrastructure, in this case, appears to have been more of a hindrance and intellectual barrier to development and cost-cutting than an aid.1 Kaku, M.

Point:The exploitation of space has directly changed our world. Satellites orbiting the Earth allow us to communicate instantaneously with people on different continents, and to broadcast to people all over the world. The Global Positioning System allows us to pinpoint our location anywhere in the world. Weather satellites save lives by giving advance warning of adverse conditions, and together with other scientific instruments in orbit they have helped us understand our own world better. Research into climate change, for example, would be almost impossible without the data provided by satellites.
Counterpoint:Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere.
Point:Space exploration is about more than the end, what is discovered or answered, it is also about the means, the process by which we are able to traverse the Universe. In 1969, the Moon landing acted as the catalyst for a whole generation of children's love for all things space and the proliferation of young men and women seeking to become astronauts. Though demand could not meet supply, many remained in the field and took up jobs in civil engineering, scientific research and medicine. Such intangible benefits to the fields of science and engineering, as John Logsdon argues, cannot so easily be calculated and contrasted with the concrete figures that symbolize the costs of space programs1.1Dubner, S.

Counterpoint:There are far cheaper, more effective methods of encouraging students towards careers in science and engineering than space exploration programs. India, not yet a flourishing space power, turns out 350,000 engineers a year whilst China, only a recent member of the manned space program club, produces 600,000 annually1. Space exploration cannot both claim to be responsible for the boom after the Moon landing and yet faultless when the numbers drop to mediocre levels, all whilst continuing to spend billions of state money.1 Engardio, P. (2005, December 27). Engineering: Is the U.S. Really Falling? Retrieved May 19, 2011, from Businessweek [5]
Point:Space exploration has also led to many indirect benefits. The challenge and difficulty of the space program, and its ability to draw on some of the finest minds, has brought about great leaps in technology. The need to reduce weight on rockets led to miniaturization, and so to the micro-chip and the modern computer. The need to produce safe but efficient power-sources for the Apollo missions led to the development of practical fuel-cells, which are now being explored as a possible future power-source for cleaner cars. The effects of zero-gravity on astronauts has substantially added to our knowledge of the workings of the human body, and the ageing process. We can never know exactly which benefits will emerge from the space program in future, but we do know that we will constantly meet new obstacles in pursuit of our goals, and in overcoming them will find new solutions to old problems.
Counterpoint:These spin-off advantages could come from any 'blue-sky' project - they are a result of the huge amounts of money and manpower devoted to the space program, giving people the resources they need to solve problems, rather than a result of the program itself. For example, many of the leaps forward in miniaturization were in fact the result of trying to build better nuclear missiles; this is not a good reason to continue building nuclear weapons. It would be far better to devote similar resources to projects with worthier goalsâ€“ for example cancer research, or research into renewable energy sources. These too could have many spin-off benefits, but would tackle real problems.
Point:Mankind must always struggle to expand its horizons. The desire to know what lies beyond current knowledge, the curiosity that constantly pushes at the boundaries of our understanding, is one of our noblest characteristics. The exploration of the universe is a high ideal - space truly is the final frontier. The instinct to explore is fundamentally human; already some of our most amazing achievements have taken place in space. No-one can deny the sense of wonder, world-wide, when for the first time a new man-made star rose in the sky, or when Neil Armstrong first stepped onto the moon and uttered his infamous words. Space exploration speaks to that part of us which rises above the everyday. The future question is not whether humans should be exploring space, but, as former NASA Director G. Scott Hubbard suggests, 'to be sure that they accomplish meaningful exploration.'11 Dubner, S. J. (2008, January 11). Is Space Exploration Worth the Cost? A Freakonomics Quorum.

Counterpoint:Space exploration expands the boundaries of travel, but it does not expand the boundaries of knowledge. Knowledge is defined as possessing a quality beyond information, a utility. Space exploration increases the amount of information we have, but has not yet provided knowledge that is applicable and useful. Neil Armstrong walking on the moon was a momentous moment for mankind, but that does alter the fact that there was little of practical value to Earth that resulted from their mission. The instinct to explore does not promise an inevitable expansion of the boundaries of knowledge.
