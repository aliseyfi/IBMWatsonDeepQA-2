Point:Criminals will do anything if it means they are better off as a result, including lying under oath. Firstly, as convicts these people have already proven themselves to have a faulty moral character. Secondly, defendants have an incentive to shift blame to reduce their own culpability. By incriminating another member of their group, informants are able to tell a story that is favourable to them, lessening their own moral culpability and reducing the cost they have to pay for committing a crime. In order to secure these benefits, cooperating witnesses have every incentive to fabricate evidence. James W. Haldin writes: “An offer of prosecutorial leniency enhances the natural tendency of an accomplice to lie by providing an incentive to offer testimony that is favorable to the prosecution…. the witness must satisfy the prosecutor in order to obtain the benefit of his bargain”[1]. Moreover, it is almost impossible to verify whether or not their information is accurate. Not only do accomplice witnesses have a motive to fabricate, they often have an ability to fabricate and to fabricate convincingly. They can manipulate their version of events without arousing much suspicion as they know all the details of the crime and which aspects of the enterprise are verifiable so where they can risk lying[2].
Counterpoint:Criminals have just as much chance of incriminating themselves with false testimony, which acts as a deterrent against providing faulty information. Accomplices are unaware of what other evidence there may be in the case, which may contradict false stories. This means that "[A]n accomplice who is unaware of the other evidence (or the lack thereof) has a selfish reason not to fabricate testimony. If the accomplice makes things up, his testimony could conflict with other evidence, and the trial judge, who usually will determine the accomplice's sentence, will see that he is a liar and treat him accordingly. Those arguments have proven effective, and defendants have been convicted of murder in federal court when the only evidence of their participation in the crime was the assertion of an accomplice"1. Moreover, accomplices have an incentive to "tell the truth and nothing but the truth" since they are sworn-in under-oath and lying under oath constitutes perjury which is punishable by a prison sentence. This would nullify any benefit to giving the testimony, as instead of receiving a less harsh sentence they would receive a harsher one, therefore providing a strong incentive to tell the truth.
Point:Testimony-based plea bargaining forces the defendant to make an agreement with the government which can be broken by the prosecutorial team at any time, leaving no check to ensure that basic rights are protected. Pamela Metzger argues "the government is to be the sole judge of whether the defendant has truthfully and completely cooperated. The decision as to whether the cooperation rises to the level of substantial assistance will be left to the sole discretion of the prosecutor's office. Often a cooperation agreement does not specify the extent of the departure the government will request. And, even if it did, that request would not be binding upon the sentencing court. Finally, if the defendant fails to perform under the terms of the agreement, the prosecutor's office retains the right to use the defendant's statements against him at a subsequent prosecution for false statements"1. Defendants that enter into plea agreements assume a massive risk insofar as their testimony can be deemed insubstantial at any point of time and then used to convict them in a later trial.
Counterpoint:If an agent consents to certain treatment, that treatment is justified. Desert stems from the choices we make rather than external factors, so consent is a sufficient condition for the justness of an action. Since plea-bargaining by definition involves an agreement from both sides, plea bargaining in exchange for testimony is just because both parties consent to it. Individuals involved in plea deals make informed decisions. There are safeguards including legal representation at every stage, even before a plea is registered, and guidance on sentencing to help to ensure that defendants make an informed and voluntary decision. Judges also have to ensure that the defendant is aware that a guilty plea will mean that he forfeits his right to a trial and that he knows the full range of penalties he faces upon conviction1.
Point:Most cases involving plea-bargaining for testimony are crimes of collusion; that is, prosecutors most often strike deals with members of organized crime groups in order to pin down the leader. As such, informants have incentives to lie in order to either improve their own standing in organized crime’s hierarchical structure or to weed out competition. R. Michael Cassidy confirms: “Because the government frequently pursues cooperation by lower echelon criminals against the higher-ups in an organization, some witnesses may view cooperation with the government in a criminal case as a means to reorder a previously hierarchical relationship…. the informant may be manipulating the system for personal or pecuniary gain, such as a desire to take over the joint criminal enterprise for himself or an ally after helping to put the confederate away”[1]. Even if the plea bargain gives accurate information the government should not be helping lower ranking members pursue their own ambitions by using the state.
Counterpoint:Testimony in organized crime trials can easily be verified. The law enforcement agencies simply have to be thorough in checking testimony. Even if the testimony is uncorroborated when it comes to the particular act the testimony should provide detailed context to allow the jury to determine how credible it is. The testimony is also unlikely to be standing on its own so there will be other areas of the testimony which can be corroborated by other evidence. For example the rules of the organization could help establish if the witness was in a position to know about the criminal act.1
Point:The practice of plea-bargaining for testimony assumes that the levels of culpability within a group are totally different. In other words, it assumes that some individuals have negligible levels of culpability and so can be bargained with while others are fully responsible and so deserve to be prosecuted to the fullest extent. But, this division is false because it ignores the collective nature of crimes of collusion. Solidarity in the mob and decision-making procedures in a corporation both change individual intentions by creating a group-based context for one’s intentions that is radically different from the context of personal experience outside of the group. As a result the actions cannot be fully explained by reference to the intentions of individual, isolated people. It therefore makes sense to talk, in a limited way, about the collective intent of social groups.[1] So, allowing testimony-based plea-bargaining disproportionately lays blame in the hands of the ringleaders of the organized crime group. Subordinates, by contrast, become witnesses for instead of enemies of the state and get off with extremely light sentences. However, just because individuals are in an authority position does not mean that they are the most responsible for that crime. Morally, there is no distinction between coming up with a crime and carrying it out. In fact, subordinates are often more dangerous because they have shown that they are willing to carry out heinous crimes. Therefore, giving subordinates more lenient sentencing disregards the collective nature of the crime and so de-links culpability and punishment.
Counterpoint:Firstly, using testimony from accomplices helps catch other guilty criminals and allows the state to administer retributive punishment on them. This is more important because with plea-bargaining there is proportional punishment for one criminal and lower punishment for another, whereas without it there is only proportional punishment for one criminal and no punishment for another. Obviously, some punishment for crime is better than no punishment, even if it isn't proportionally retributive. Second, plea-bargaining for testimony ensures that the guilty are caught and not the innocent. Without it, the state runs a greater risk of convicting innocents. Convicting innocents creates a massive retributive gap since innocents by definition did not do anything warranting punishment and thus are due no retribution. Third, reduced sentencing for those members who followed orders to do the organization's dirty-work is justified. Henchman of the organization merely follow orders and are thus not fully responsible for the actions they take due to their diminished decision-making, and this lower level of responsibility should be reflected in sentencing.
