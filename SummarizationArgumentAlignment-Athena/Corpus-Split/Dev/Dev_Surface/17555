Point:Mandatory sentencing laws prevent judges from taking into consideration aggravating and mitigating circumstances when imposing punishment. This is because by nature, fixed penalties must ignore whether mandatory sentences have “beneficial or deleterious effects on the victims and on the family and associates of the defendant” 1. At times, this results in greater injury to society than a more lenient alternative. Instead sentencing should be much more flexible to take into account all the different circumstances of a case and the nature of the crime.
Counterpoint:By enforcing a strict set of guidelines for sentencing, mandatory penalties ensure that the sympathies of an individual judge cannot impede the fair enforcement of the law by motivating him to impose an overly lenient punishment. These statutes “make decision-making more transparent and predictable...sentencing decisions lacked a coherent structure...in the past, judges’ sentencing decisions were not subjected to rules, and the lack of rules could result in unfair and unequal treatment of offenders” 1.
Point:By mandating extraordinarily long sentences, three strike laws contribute to the problem of overcrowding in prisons. While inmates who have received life sentences under such statutes are permanently removed from society, studies “show that overcrowded and poorly regulated prisons tend to have higher rates of rape andsexual violence” 1. Those inmates who have received lighter sentences are, furthermore, less likely to receive access to proper rehabilitative programs, to such an extent that “studies have demonstrated a correlation between overcrowding and increased recidivism.” 1
Counterpoint:Lengthy sentences for repeat offenders are credited with helping to reduce crime. Though mandatory minimum sentencing laws generally do result in those convicted spending more time behind bars, any contributing effect this trend would have on overcrowding in prisons is mitigated by the decrease in overall crime rates that such policies tend to produce. In particular, “California’s three strike legislation reduces felony arrests rates among the class of criminals with two strikes by 15-20% per year with some estimates as high as 30%... the two strike provision of the law deters on the order of... 12,712 crimes per year” 1.
Point:Three strikes laws mandate that courts impose upon offenders a lengthy minimum sentence upon conviction of a third offense. In California, the first two strikes must be considered serious or violent, but the mandatory minimum sentence of 25-years may be imposed upon conviction of any third felony offense. In Ewing v. California (2003), a four-time felon received the mandatory minimum sentence upon conviction of stealing three golf clubs with a combined total value of less than $1,200. Regardless of how severe a view one takes of recidivism, such a punishment is clearly excessive and grossly disproportionate to the current offense. Allowing mandatory minimum sentences to be applied in cases like this undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system.
Counterpoint:Recidivists should receive increasingly severe sentences in order to protect the general public It is not imprisonment that undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system, but the failure of the system to keep the public safe. Research has found that habitual adult offenders commit a large percentage of crimes, and that a majority of inmates who are released from prison are likely to reoffend within a short period of time 1. Three-strike laws protect citizens from incorrigible offenders by incorporating past behaviour into the sentencing equation.
