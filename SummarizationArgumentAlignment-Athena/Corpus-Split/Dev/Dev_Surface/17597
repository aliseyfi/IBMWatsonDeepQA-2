Point:Despite the fact that using a mobile (cell) phone is illegal in many countries, there are still places including a lot of US states1 in which it is completely legal to use a phone even to send text messages– indeed one in three (34%) texting teens ages 16-17 say they have texted while driving1. This has been identified as a serious problem among teenage drivers2 who are themselves more familiar with the technology and do not see driving as an environment in which it is inappropriate to divert one’s attention. Adding at least a year onto the legal driving age would bring maturity in all areas and an increased awareness of the dangers of driving whilst using mobile media and communication devices.
Counterpoint:Once again this is more a question of experience and individual adherence to good driving rather than a question of age. If young people are more likely to be using mobile phones even where it is legal, raising the age restrictions on driving would not solve the problem. Every year children are becoming more technologically adept, so it stands to reason that this would simply delay any potential problems rather than solve them. More resources could be put into the implementation of hands-free devices, as well as technology which would prevent people from using phones in the car at all1.
Point:Few countries think 16 and 17 year olds are grown up enough to vote1, drink alcohol2 or smoke3. Yet most allow them to get behind the wheel of a car4, even though it is a dangerous weapon in immature, careless or reckless hands. Society usually sees 18 as the age at which young people become adults. Shouldn't driving be one of the privileges ad responsibilities of adulthood?
Counterpoint:Allowing young people to drive right at the point at which they are also able to consume legal drugs like alcohol and nicotine is surely a step in the wrong direction. By allowing young people the responsibility to learn to drive without the temptation of performance inhibiting drugs you at least give them a chance to learn the real dangers and challenges of driving so that they will hopefully be able to make safer decisions while driving. Driving is also not comparable to drinking or smoking in that it requires a proficiency test, and those who drive have to adhere to strict laws. Young people are not simply 'let loose' in cars - they are taught how to use them properly and have to prove they are able to do so.
Point:Human life is precious and whilst driving remains one of the most dangerous things people do on a day to day basis1, we must do everything reasonable to prevent deaths. Raising the driving age will cut the number of accidents on the roads. In 2008 alone in the USA there were 6428 fatalities involving young drivers and passengers aged between 15 and 20. Raising the driving age by a year or more will greatly reduce these accidents and deaths.
Counterpoint:Young drivers do have more accidents, but that is because they are not very experienced, not simply because they are under 18. If we raise the driving age, it will be 18-19 year old new drivers having more accidents instead of 16-17 year olds. With this in mind, options like having a more rigorous driving test or imposing stricter rules on young people even after they have passed would do a better job of saving lives. Schemes like Pass Plus1 in the UK or Graduate Driver Licensing in the USA could be more widely implemented, and statistics for countries like Finland where the driving tests are far more advanced show the positive effects this could have3.
Point:In most countries there are strict rules that govern who is and is not allowed to drive. Practically speaking, the infrastructure is already there to enforce an increase in the age limit – one of the main aims of the Metropolitan Police in the UK is “Seizing uninsured and unlicensed vehicles”1 - the age limit for licensing has no effect on the Police's ability to enforce the law. Governments already restrict driving to make it safer through laws concerning alcohol use, insurance and the age limits already in place. Making the age limit higher would simply add to this campaign to make the roads a safer place.
Counterpoint:Governments already do a lot to restrict road use to make it safer. Unfortunately we live at a time in which financial resources for such ventures are very limited and the police forces around the world are often stretched to breaking point. For example, in the UK the police budget is being cut by a massive 20% which will undoubtedly have a significant impact on their ability to enforce the law . Bringing in a scheme to increase the legal driving age would not only be expensive in itself, it would also require an increase in the amount of policing on the roads which the police themselves simply cannot afford. It has even been suggested that we already need more officers to make the roads safer - asking the police to enforce a change like this would just make the situation worse.
