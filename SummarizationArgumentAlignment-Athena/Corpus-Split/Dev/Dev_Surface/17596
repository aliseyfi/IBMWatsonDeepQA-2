Point:The status quo denies the English their own distinctive political identity. The devolution settlement acknowledges that the political preferences and cultural identities of the Scottish, Welsh and English peoples are sufficiently different to warrant the creation of separate Scottish and Welsh legislatures. If political preferences were the same between these nations, there would be no problem with having one central Parliament. Proponents of devolution must, therefore, believe that such differences exist. However, having done the Scottish and Welsh the service of allowing them to elect representatives of their political preferences, the UK denies this right to the English, forcing them to continue to be subject to the political preferences of the Scottish and Welsh, who can vote in Westminster elections. This process is clearly unfair, and generates an inequality within the UK. This is exemplified by the fact that in the 2005 General Elections, a plurality of English votes were cast in favour of the Conservative Party,(35.7% compared to labour's 35.4%)1 but a Labour Government was elected, partly on the back of the heavily Labour-dominated Scottish and Welsh votes.1 Election 2005, 'Results England' BBC News, 10 May 2005 [1], accessed 28 August 2011
Counterpoint:The devolution settlement was designed with English dominance in mind. The reason why the Scottish and Welsh desired autonomy from Westminster was against a historical backdrop of oppression by the English, and because of a remaining fact that the English dominated proceedings at Westminster. This is for three reasons: 1) the location of the UK Parliament in London, which meant that all MPs were residents of England; 2) the population of England compared to Scotland and Wales, guaranteeing it a substantial majority of seats; and 3) the economic power of England within the UK, particularly that of London. The necessitated independent representative bodies for Scotland and Wales, whose political identities were suppressed before devolution. Post-devolution, no such problem exists for England– it remains the dominant nation within the UK Parliament, and has little difficulty exerting its influence over UK politics (indeed it continues to exert more influence over Scotland through Sewell motions than the Scottish Parliament does). The statistic about the 2005 General Election is a diversion, since Labour would still have won a majority of seats in England, despite not having a plurality of votes (owing to the first-past-the-post electoral system). In addition to this, it is clear that the English themselves are relatively uninterested in devolution and the issues brought about by the ‘West Lothian Question’.1 In the early 21st century the main preference of English constituencies was for the status quo of government by the UK Parliament in Westminster.2
Point:There is an issue with accountability under the status quo. Around 20% of the MPs elected to Parliament are elected from constituencies outside of England, and these MPs all get to vote on issues which affect only England. Most MPs can be held to account for their decisions by their local constituents, who can lobby their MPs by writing to them, attending local surgeries (meetings with the MPs) or by switching their vote at the next election. Such scrutiny and accountability takes place under the assumption that when the MP votes, she does so in the interests of her constituents, and they may protest if she does not vote in their interests. However, for the 20% of Parliament whose constituents are totally unaffected by the outcome of the vote, no accountability can be expected. No Scottish or Welsh constituents will write to their local MP, or change the way they vote, based on their MP's voting record on matters which cannot affect them. As such, a fifth of MPs stay in their jobs without fear of public scrutiny, and knowing that the likelihood of their being re-elected is divorced from their voting record in Parliament. An English Parliament would solve this problem, by creating a situation in which all politicians vote only on those issues that may affect their constituents. Politicians, such as Malcolm Rifkind, have suggested that an English Parliament, or in this case Grand Committee, would increase the accountability of MPs thus making the system much fairer1.1 Rifkind, Malcolm, 'Be fair, give devolution to England', The Times, Nov. 4th 2007 [4], accessed 27th June 2011
Counterpoint:To say that the 'West Lothian Question' hinders accountability is to misunderstand how the electorate votes. General elections are not, as the proposition case requires, decided upon by the local electorate's satisfaction with their MP. They are, effectively, voted in along party lines, with the electorate voting for the party they prefer, not the candidate. As a result, it is nonsense to believe that politicians are held to account by local lobbying efforts, letters to MPs and constituency surgeries. They are held to account by media scrutiny, by the effect of the central government's policies on people's lives, and by Parliamentary committees and the opposition.The introduction of an English Parliament would, in fact, reduce the quality of policy-making and accountability by spreading a scarce number of talented policy-makers and politicians over a greater number of legislative bodies and parliamentary committees. It is good that the Westminster Parliament concentrates the most successful political operators in one organisation, which can develop good policy and effectively hold the government to account. Good policies made for England by Westminster can then be recommended to the Scottish Parliament, a procedure known as a Sewell motion.
Point:An English Parliament is required to overcome a democratic deficit. In the status quo, Scottish and Welsh MPs get to vote on issues that do not affect their constituents, but may be pivotal in getting through legislation that affects the English. This in fact happened with the vote on university top-up fees: top-up fees were implemented in England despite a majority of English MPs voting against introducing them. They were passed only because Scottish MPs voted with the government, even though the Scottish Parliament had already voted not to introduce them for Scottish universities. Here we have a clear example of the representatives of English citizens voting down a proposal, but the policy being implemented on the English (against their will) because of the votes of outsiders. This totally undermines the democratic principle of self-rule and according to Paul Kingsworth these policies are, therefore, flawed. The policies were not, in many cases, representative of the public's wishes in the geographical area they were to be implemented1. Democracy exists so that a population can decide for itself what laws it lives under– the absence of an English Parliament denies the English this right to decide for themselves, because sometimes the Scots and Welsh decide for them.2
Counterpoint:The 'West Lothian Question' creates no more problems than any other aspect of a system of representative democracy. It is simply a feature of democracy that large institutions make decisions which don't affect all of the population, and yet we have no problem with everyone getting a say in those matters. Parliament makes policy on education and health, for example, despite some people not being affected by those decisions. The fact that the Scottish and Welsh voters have an influence over English affairs is no more undemocratic than some English people getting to have a say on matters that will affect other English people. In order to make the claim that the English are denied a right to self-rule because of the 'West Lothian Question', one would have to claim that there was some special quality – ‘Englishness’ – that made English people qualified to make decisions on behalf of one another, but disqualified the Scots from making such decisions. Such a quality clearly does not exist – a representative of Berwick-upon-Tweed is no more able to look after the interests of someone from Cornwall than a representative of Dumfries. Some also believe that that an English Parliament would cause further friction between conflicting wishes and policies and would, eventually, cause Britain to act undemocratically.1
Point:It is problematic that England, Scotland and Wales elect politicians to the same legislature with differing mandates. A mandate is a commission given to a government and its policies or an elected representative and his policies through an electoral victory. The Westminster Parliament can only affect the Scottish and Welsh through foreign policy, therefore, Scottish and Welsh MPs are elected by their constituents with a mandate to enact policy in areas of foreign policy. Meanwhile, English politicians have a mandate to enact both foreign and domestic policy, since their electorates vote them in to carry out these functions. This means that one set of MPs are not acting under an electoral mandate when they vote in Parliament and, consequently, their decisions lack the legitimacy of English MPs. Separating the functions of foreign and domestic policy into two separate parliaments would make the mandates of elected politicians clear, and enable all MPs to vote with a consistent level of legitimacy1.
Counterpoint:Again, the proposition's case rests on anunrealistic view of what constitutes a political mandate. The electorate do not elect politicians with a specific set of policies in mind, but rather treat the General Election as a referendum on the government. Since the central government still controls aspects of Scottish and Welsh life (through macroeconomic and foreign policy decisions and Sewell motions), it is appropriate that Scottish and Welsh voters should have a say in who sits in that government. It is not the case that an English Parliament would not affect the Scottish and Welsh at all – economic movement and the free movement of people within the UK, overlapping public bodies and administration, and the political and economic impact of England on the rest of the UK would all contribute to the effect of the English Parliament on Scotland and Wales.1 Thus, an effective referendum on the government of England is one in which Scotland and Wales should have a say.
