Point:The UK's integration with Europe depends on having a similar legal foundation. Every other EU member has formal superordinate legal documents, such as the French Constitution or German Basic Law. The only other European nation without a written constitution is San Marino, and its government's operations are only a fraction of the UK's size. It is important to enshrine clarity in our legal code in order to engage in intra-EU economic, social, and political relations, because it creates a common conception of the foundation of a state's laws.
Counterpoint:It is not, in actual fact, necessary to bring have a constitution similar to the rest of Europe in order to be an active member of the EU. The EU membership represents a diverse range of legal foundations1. Even were it a benefit to integration, it is not worth compromising the UK's political identity for a marginal improvement in access to Europe.1 OECD, "Constitutions of Central and Eastern European Countries and the Baltic States", Sigma Papers No.2 (1995) [3]
Point:A written constitution acts as a safeguard against extremists and politicians attempting to consolidate power. In the unlikely event that a political party gained power and attempted to impose radical and tyrannical change upon the citizenry, specific constitutional limits on the power of government, and specific protection for rights vital to democracy and government accountability, would provide a major obstacle. While there are certainly other avenues to establish despotism, a constitution would deprive any potential extremist of the ability to achieve it within the confines of the law. So for example the German constitution allows the German Federal Constitutional Court to declare parties unconstitutional and dissolve them1, this is in order to prevent the rise of extremists to power in the way Hitler managed it. It has twice declared parties unconstitutional; these were the Socialist Reich Party and the Communist Party of Germany both in 19512.1 Paul Franz, 'Unconstitutional and Outlawed Political Parties: A German-American Comparison', Boston College International and Comparative Law Review, 5 51 (1982) p.51 [4]2"Government Commits to Seeking a Ban of the Extreme Right-Wing National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD)", 1 German Law Journal (2000), [5]
Counterpoint:The chances of a tyrant seizing control of the country via election to the House of Commons are very minute indeed. If such a party was indeed popular enough to get elected, constitutional blocks would be of little stop to them. When Hitler came to power by election, he quickly dismantled the constitutional checks on his power, and did so easily because of his wide popular support. It is far wiser to rely on the will of the public to oppose such dictators than to depend on a constitution.
Point:Entrenching the respective rights of individuals and the government adds clarity to issues where the boundaries of the law are vague. Not every time that civil rights are eroded is it the result of the government overstepping what were previously thought to be the clear boundaries of the state’s power; sometimes there is a legitimate grey area regarding the meeting of two rights. For example, some people contest whether anti-social behavioral orders (ASBOs) – which bar individuals from certain activities or place1 – or CCTV cameras, are a legitimate use of the coercive power of the state. Under the status quo, there is no superordinate legal document to which an individual or the government can point when they dispute whether or not a law is legitimate. Thus, while popular opinion can prevent the government from brazen violations of citizens’ rights, more nuanced infringements persist with impunity. A constitution would subject controversial laws to judicial review, yielding a more precise ruling on their constitutionality. Regardless of which way the judiciary rules, it must be backed up by reasoned argument and interpretation of specific legal principles explicitly outlined in the constitution. It is crucial to have an independent metric by which we evaluate when the government reaches the limits of what it may justly legislate.
Counterpoint:A case-by-case approach to determining the validity of laws is better than adopting a one-size-fits-all method of saying, for instance, that privacy never trumps security. If a law's worth is disputed, those who disagree can appeal to principles rather than constitutional clauses when arguing its merits. The metric by which laws are evaluated in a democracy ought to be whether the populace accepts them as just. Furthermore, an explicit constitution does not get rid of such legal grey areas, as even the explicit US constitution is subject to constitution battles over its interpretation.
Point:The documents that currently make up the written component of the UK's informal constitution provide an accessible starting point. Such ancient texts and treaties as the Magna Carta would provide for a smooth transition from commonly-accepted legal principles to the formal entrenchment of those principles in the clauses of a constitution. While under the status quo all laws passed by parliament are considered of equal significance, there is an informal recognition by some jurists that certain laws, such as the Human Rights Act, enjoy a favored position within a hierarchy of laws1. A written constitution would simply help to formalize this de facto hierarchy.1 England and Wales High Court, 'Thoburn vs. Sunderland City Council' EWHC 195, (2002) [7]
Counterpoint:These documents, while an important source of historical legitimacy for current informal constitutional practices, do not represent anything approaching a comprehensive or modern understanding of the rights of citizens. Moreover, their role would in fact be diminished from their current status as an actual part of the collection of written and unwritten ideas that comprise our constitution, becoming instead mere historical documents.
Point:A formal constitution provides the separation of powers necessary to keep each part of the government in check. Clearly delineated oversight powers in an independent judiciary would halt Parliament's attempts to overstep its mandate, and provide a mechanism to redress flagrant violations of ethics by MPs. Such a check on the power of the Parliament would be a welcome change from the status quo of a government who may act with little accountability short of an election. Similarly, explicit and independent powers for the House of Lords and the House of Commons would codify a role to hold each other accountable. This would be similar to the way that the United States constitution works with its famous separation of powers and checks and balances with the exception that the executive would still be within the legislature rather than completely separate.
Counterpoint:A good political climate is one where government functions properly. In a representative democracy, decision-making is not intended to be majoritarian. Elected officials are in place to make decisions on behalf of constituents, as they continue to do with matters relating to the EU. As such, a referendum is a direct rebuke to their own power. Therefore MPs should not hold one, even if some constituents want it. It is not the job of government to neutralize radical voices, but to offer better alternatives while preserving freedom of expression. If parties want to resolve the Europe question, they should do so through established political channels.
