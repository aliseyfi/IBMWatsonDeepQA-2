Point:As Tony Blair’s former special adviser to foreign affairs Robert Cooper has argued, failed “pre-modern” states – those without a domestic monopoly on the use of force and stable state institutions – pose significant threats to international peace and security because they can provide a base for non-state actors (including terrorists) to plan and launch attacks without a hindrance. Invasion, or “defensive imperialism” (Afghanistan providing an example), may be the only effective response to this threat [1]. The instability in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, for example, made it impossible to rely on the Afghanistan government to pursue Al Qaeda. Furthermore, the Taliban effectively inferred Al Qaeda with governmental functions, including the projection of force abroad [2]. In cases such as this, interstate cooperation is ineffectual and armed action may be necessary. Even more alarming still is the possibility of “rogue states” cooperating with international terrorists, and allowing terrorist groups to acquire Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) or chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. Pre-emptive military action can protect against these threats [3]. Invasion can also act as a deterrent to other regimes thinking of supporting terrorism as it demonstrates to them that allowing attacks upon other countries will result in massive retaliation and the swift overthrow of the sponsoring regime.
Counterpoint:There is scant evidence to suggest that failed states provide the conditions for terrorism to prosper. While a few ‘failed states’ have provided a base for terrorists, the vast majority have not [1]. Moreover, in several key states that can be regarded as ‘failed’ or ‘failing’ and where terrorists operate – including Yemen and Pakistan – invasion has not been necessary. In these states the US and its allies have built relationships with the countries’ ruling regimes and have undertaken highly effective methods short of invasion – such as drone attacks and the raid on Bin Laden’s compound – which have significantly weakened terrorist networks. Finally, while terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda may have a desire to use unconventional weapons such as CBRNs, there is very little evidence or proof to suggest that they have the capability to execute successful attacks. Indeed, the use of unconventional weapons by terrorist groups is rare [2].
Point:Article 51 of the U.N. Charter upholds a state's right to use force in self-defense against states that harbor terrorists. Article 51 makes reference to a state's fundamental right to self-defense, and allows states to undertake certain measures in the event of an armed attack. Allies may also assist in "collective self-defense"1. In the case of Afghanistan, the United States and its allies made distinct references to Article 51 in justifying military action against the Taliban regime2. Therefore, invasion in response to terrorism can be legal under international law if, as in Afghanistan, it is initiated in self-defense and designed to deter future attacks.
Counterpoint:It is evident that war against states that purportedly harbor terrorists is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of Article 51 in anything other than very narrow and exceptional circumstances. Self-defense claims are only valid if an attack is imminent or ongoing. Terrorist attacks are often sporadic and the intelligence on future attacks is usually unspecific, and therefore waging a war in response to terrorism does not meet the criteria for self-defense. States such as Afghanistan that purportedly "harbor" terrorists can also not be regarded as "aggressors" and "perpetrators". This would require that states instrumentally use terrorist groups to attack other states, rather than simply "harboring" them and even having knowledge of their intent. Moreover, invasion can only be legal where armed force is the only available means of self-defense. In the case of terrorism, war is unlikely to be the 'last resort'. International police action and criminal prosecution of terrorists represent alternative and more effective options, but these were deliberately neglected when war was launched against Afghanistan1.
Point:Nation-building has been a central element of post-invasion planning for the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions, as well as possible future wars. In Afghanistan in particular, invasion coupled with subsequent nation building has been successful in constructing relatively stable political institutions and promoting economic development. In addition, efforts have been made to promote women's rights and tackle extremist ideology. While the military element of invasion can forcefully disrupt terrorist networks and deter future attacks, nation-building can complement invasion through effectively tackling many of the social roots of terrorism by building stable and legitimate political and economic institutions to facilitate democratic governance and economic growth. Humanitarian assistance and economic empowerment also offers people an alternative to joining terrorist groups1.
Counterpoint:Nation-building exercises are likely to fail, are far too costly, and do not reduce the threat from terrorism. Moreover, there is not an inherent threat of terrorism from weak states, and where one may be present, it can be tackled through existing institutional capacity without the need for invasion or nation-building. Arguments for nation-building also rest on very debatable assumptions – for example that the roots of terrorism lie in poverty and lack of education (which is contradicted by the relatively wealthy status of many Al Qaeda operatives), and false analogies to the Marshall Plan and European reconstruction after World War II [1]. In Afghanistan, nation-building has been a dismal failure, with high levels of corruption crippling the country’s political and economic institutions, and warlords controlling large swaths of the country while continuing many of the misogynistic and violent practices of their Taliban predecessors [2].
