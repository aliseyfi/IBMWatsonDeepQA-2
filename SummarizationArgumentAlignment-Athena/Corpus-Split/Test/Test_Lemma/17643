point : the sheer volume of advertising in our society be incredible . you cannot watch television , ride on a bus or even walk down the street without someone try to sell you something or inform you of something . recent research suggest people live in a city today see up to 5 , 000 advertisement a day1 . 50 of those survey say they think 'advertising today be out of control'1 . people shouldn't have to go about their life have their mind saturate with such a vast quantity of , in most case , redudant and profiteer information . they should be able to go about their daily life in peace without be force to watch , listen or view an advertisement . 
counterpoint : though there be a great many advertisement in everyday life , there be not so many that they can't simply be ignore . advertisements attempt to get you to buy a product , if you're not interested , then don't buy the product . for every person who find all the advertisement stressful , another person find them enjoyable and something to read or watch while they make their daily journey to work or school . out of control could mean simply that customer think business be spend too much on advertising . without proof that the number of advertisement be have a negative effect , the point be worthless . 
point : advertising lead to many people be overwhelm by the endless need to decide between compete demand on their attention this be know a the tyranny of choice or choice overload . recent research suggest that people be on average less happy than they be 30 year ago despite be good off and have much more choice of thing to spend their money on1 . the claim of advert crowd in on people , raise expectation about a product and lead to inevitable disappointment after it be buy . a recent advertisement for make up be ban in britain due to the company present it product a be more effective than it actually was2 . shoppers feel that a poor purchase be their fault for not choose more wisely , and regret not choose something else instead . some people be so overwhelmed that they cannot choose at all . 
counterpoint : people be unhappy because they can't have everything , not because they be give too much choice and find it stressful . in fact , advertisement play a crucial role in ensure that what money people have , they spend on the most appropriate product for themselves . if advertisement be not permit , people would waste money on an initial product when , give the choice , they clearly would go for another . 
point : people cannot just choose to ignore advertising , because advertiser use many underhand method to get their message across . posters have attention grabbing word , or provocative picture . some advert today be even be hide in what seem like piece or art or public information so people don't realise they be be market to . the introduction of digital screen allow business to alter their advertising to respond to specific event , make advertisement not only everywhere , but seemingly all knowing1 . by target people's unconscious thought advert be a form of brainwash that take away people's freedom to make choice . 
counterpoint : adverts which use very sly method like subliminal image image which be show so quickly the viewer doesn't consciously realise they saw them be already ban . the other form of advertising be just company be creative . there be no difference from supermarket be paint bright colour to make their food seem more appetising or even people wear make up to improve their image . people make unconscious judgement all the time , and we frequently try to influence these choice by the way we present ourselves . this isn't brainwashing , so neither be advertise . 
point : many advert do more than just advertising product . some try to make people feel inferior if they don't have the product , or if they have something which the product would change . perceptions of beauty and fashion in particular have be terribly distort . many young people have low self esteem , and lead unhealthy lifestyle because they feel they should be thin and more attractive like the model they see in advert . this lead to serious problem like eat disorder and self harm . research that prove this effect also conclude that 'the medium can boost self esteem happiness with one's self where it be provide example of a variety of body shape . however , it often tend to portray a limited small number of body shapes'1 . 
counterpoint : the medium and celebrity magazine do much more harm , by mock unattractive or overweight people , and glorify model who be often dangerously thin . adverts never criticise people that would be terrible for the company behind them . their aim be to understand and provide what people want , and so their advert only ever reflect what people think . if people's perception be wrong , then it not the advertisers' job to put them right , but politician , the medium and school . 
point : advertising give the impression , especially to child , that they can and should have everything they want . this make people too interested in material thing . people be become more selfish and obsess with their possession , and lose their value of patience , hard work , moderation and the importance of non material thing like family and friend . this harm their relationship and their personal development , which have serious effect for society a a whole . 
counterpoint : our society be build around the idea that company produce thing that people want , and this be what make u prosperous . if consumer suddenly stop want to buy so many product then what happen to the people whose job it be to make them ? the economy will suffer terribly . of course some people take materialism too far , but most people buy just what they need and then a little extra when they treat themselves . this be a much good situation than one in which people can only afford to buy the thing they need that would be a step backwards .
