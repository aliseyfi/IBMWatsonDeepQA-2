point : some culture place great importance on have at least one child of a particular gender . we can help realise this aim . we can prevent the trauma and stress of not have a child of a particular gender , which can have negative cultural connotation . if a state's population become seriously imbalanced , one might have to rethink : but give that most country , include all in the west , have balance population , and give that many family in most country will choose to have roughly a many of the other sex , this should not stop this proposal be put into effect in many country . even in china , the problem be largely due to the one child policy which have be relax in many area since the mid 1990s . over time , a scarcity of one gender will in any case produce new pressure to rebalance the population , for example the pay of dowry may change , and woman will achieve high status . 
counterpoint : this argument veil the likely result of the policy : reinforcement of already unhealthy cultural practice . selective abortion have mean that gender imbalance in china and india be already very , very high 914 girl for every 1 , 000 boy in india demonstrate the likely result of such policy in some country 1 . 
point : gender selection technology should be available , at whatever cost the market dictate , to those who can afford the process and wish to choose the sex of their child . there should be no other restriction on the couple wish to go through with the process , other than an assurance that the mother be physically able and willing . as it be not an essential procedure , the state should not be expect to subsidize either the process or the development of the technology . nevertheless , the private sector should be encourage to develop the technology and continue to provide the public with a path to maximise their own happiness . 
counterpoint : a medical procedure be not a product that should be exclude from those who cannot afford it . either it be beneficial enough to be subsidize by the state and therefore available to all , or it be the start of a slippery slope towards designer baby and therefore should not be available to anyone . furthermore , the investment and expertise require to develop such technology be resource that should be utilize for cause that be far more important , under fund and under develop than gender selection . to allow the private sector to provide such a gender selection service would not only encourage further investment in a unnecessary technology but tempt medical professional away from their government fund research with the promise of more money . 
point : people should have freedom of choice . why shouldn t would be parent be able to do this , give that no harm be do to others by their decision ? article 16 1 of the universal declaration of human rights state that : men and woman of full age have the right to marry and to find a family and this right should be understood to cover the right to make decision over how that family should be form 1 . when a family have a large number of boy or girl , why should they be deprive of the opportunity to have a child of a different gender if the technology exist ? as the director of the fertility institute note , these be grow up people express their reproductive choice they be really happy when they get what they want 2 . 
counterpoint : freedom of choice be an important principle generally , but it should not be grant at the expense of unconditional love for one s child . the pre selection of gender be a threat to the core value of parenthood that be usually express by the commitment to unconditional love , accord to a georgetown professor 1 . children should not be love because of who they be , not because they be exactly what we want of them . as harvard professor michael sandel note , consider the father who want a boy in hope of have a a son the athlete he have never be . suppose the son isn t interested in sport what sort of expectation will burden a child who have design with certain purpose in mind ? 1 . for that reason , parent should not be permit freedom of choice in this regard , but encourage to love their child equally , regardless of gender . 
point : some parent be carrier of know sex specific disease . it be obviously in the child's interest that they don't have such a condition . determining it gender can ensure that . many family have predisposition towards certain common condition that be more likely in one gender in another , and these can be avoid too . nearly all neurodevelopmental disease be either more common in one gender or more severe among one gender . arthritis , heart disease and even lung cancer also seem to be influence by a person's gender . males disproportionately suffer from x chromosome problem because their body have no copy to fall back on 1 these range in nature from baldness and colour blindness to muscular dystrophy and haemophilia . women be disproportionately affect by disease of the immune system 2 . genetic modification be not the only technology available . the microsort technique use a 'sperm sifting' machine to detect the minute difference between y and double x chromosome carry sperm : no genetic harm result from it use . over 1200 baby have be bear use the technology 3 . 
counterpoint : sex specific , generic disease be only avoid a majority of the time , the process be not near 100 accurate and therefore the medical benefit cannot be use without consider of the medical cost . pre implantation genetic diagnosis involve the development of embryo outside the womb , which be then test for gender . one or two of the desire gender be then implant in the womb . those that be not of the desired gender , or be surplus to requirement be destroy typically , over a dozen embryo be use to select a single one to be implant . a human life have be create with the express purpose of be destroy . this be another form of abortion only the conception be deliberate . ultimately , it will be these technology and not microsort that be use , since whilst the latter have a 93 accuracy rate if a girl be desire itself a low result than genetic diagnosis , it accuracy fall to 82 for boy , and the vast majority of selection will inevitably be for male 1 . thus , give that they be so keen to have a child of a particular gender and so unwilling to risk have one of the other gender , parent will not risk use microsort . even if they do choose it , whilst there have not be overt problem thus far , scientific expert like lord winston express the fear that the process damage sperm , make genetic mutation much more likely . both technique be therefore to be condemn .
