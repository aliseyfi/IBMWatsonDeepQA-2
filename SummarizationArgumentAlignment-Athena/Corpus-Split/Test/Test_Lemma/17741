point : providing condom to student in public education program will reduce the incidence of underage pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmit disease . if one accept the premise that condom be an effective mean of prevention , it stand to reason that their distribution could have a significant impact . 
counterpoint : condom use by children be not a sure fire way of prevent the harm proposition have outline . condoms can be ineffective , lead to the spread of stis and teenage pregnancy . 
point : many young girl feel pressure into sex before they be ready . this pressure be from various source ; friend , boyfriend and the melange of mixed message and highly sexualised role model communicate to them by the medium . 3 girls grow be encourage to be sexual being and may feel they have no control over their own body . 
counterpoint : girls who feel pressure into sex will feel even more so if give condom to them by their teacher . children see teacher a figure of authority , and can easily take the message that have sex so young be a good thing , cause the problem that proposition want to prevent . 
point : as highlight earlier , condom distribution can counter harm such a stis and teenage pregnancy . it also can provide an educational benefit . by provide teenager with frank , straightforward information about both sex and condom young people will be much more likely to understand when they be ready to have sex . they will also be much more confident in reject unwanted advance and avoid reckless or risky sexual encounter . 
counterpoint : education about sex simply promote it a something pleasurable and risk free , without fully communicate it potential to cause harm . giving child condom far promotes sex without full consideration for it harm . children may get poor information about sex , but give child condom only exacerbate the problem . condom distribution tell child that sex be something that should be do , obscure the serious message at the heart of sex education . this make attempt to cut through the cacophony of noise in popular culture that pressure child into sex more difficult .
