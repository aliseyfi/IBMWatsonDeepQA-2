point : when destroy the flag of the united states it be the value of the united states that be under attack . since the birth of the nation the flag of the united states , the eponymous star spangled banner , have be fly proudly in all part of the country . it have become an endemic fixture in american culture and have come to be see by people all over the united states , and the world , a a representation of the spirit and identity of nation . it appear on every seal of public office , be fly outside every public building and a flag shape pin be wear upon the breast of virtually every public figure . the flag have be imbue with a special significance by the citizen of the united states , and be view almost universally with extensive reverence1 . it have come to be see a emblematic of all the value and virtue of american society . in a way it be the physical sublimation of those value ; at least that be how it be often treat . for this reason , to destroy the flag be to destroy the value they represent , and thus the flag must be protect in order to protect the value of the nation the flag represent . 
counterpoint : the value of the united states be what should be protect , not the flag . one of those value be the upholding of freedom of speech and expression . the right to express one view and opinion must be hold inviolable to an extent . while there be a case for defamation and hate speech law because they have a very real and direct impact on people , the flag be only important insofar a people ascribe mean to it . it be foolish to make illegal a view contrary to the mainstream that may not value the flag so highly . 
point : freedom of speech and expression be an important right , which be why it be list first in the bill of rights ; it be central to a fair and free democracy . however , it have limit . some form of speech be contrary to the value of democracy , namely when they infringe upon or violate the ability of others to enact their own right and freedom . this be why such thing a incitement to hatred , other violence promote speech , as well a defamation and perjury be legislate against ; they be expression that infringe the right of others , by cause fear and increase risk of harm in case of hate speech , and by harm reputation and the effective administration of justice in term of defamation and perjury respectively . rights stop where harm to others begin . in the case of flag burning , a the dissent opinion of justice william rehnquist on the issue say , the act be an extremely visceral one , and be often perceive a a direct attack on the core value of america itself , which many consider to be representative of those value , lead to feeling of anger and violation1 . it be an infringement of these offend people's right when flag be allow to be burn . 
counterpoint : unlike hate speech or defamation , when some burn a flag no one be actually hurt . some people may feel their sensibility offend by such act , but make people feel uncomfortable should not be illegal . the act of flag burning be in itself neutral . the direction of the message the act be mean to convey be what must be consider , not the act itself . prohibiting flag burning be in this sense pointless . furthermore , it should be within someone's right to challenge the value of the nation and to destroy the symbol of those value a evidence of their disagreement . if people cannot challenge those value then society be not free at all . 
point : it be highly questionable whether burn a flag can be consider a speech or expressive act at all . it seem to offer up no new concept or true opinion to the marketplace of idea . nothing be genuinely express by the act that could not be do through word or other , less fiery mean . the act of flag burning do nothing to help the advancement or elucidation of truth , which be why people have the right to freedom of expression in the first place . rather , it cloud the issue supposedly be further by the act . it welcome the rhetoric of un americanism , whereby critic and commentator question the protestors' general patriotism , not the validity of their underlying cause , which can eventually lead to the same criticism of their cause itself . anger cloud the discussion , with people view the cause in term of unpatriotic people support the cause , and thus call for patriot to oppose it . examples of this problem can be see clearly in the various protest during the vietnam war in which misguide protestors burn flag to show their opposition to the war and killing of innocent . the response to these protest , however , be accusation of lack of patriotism on the part of those involve and give a powerful rhetorical tool to the political group still support the fight1 . furthermore , when anger and rhetoric cloud all discussion of an issue , it can lead to unmeasured , even violent response from authority and concerned citizen . flag burning be thus counterproductive a a tool of protest , since it stop the message be propagate and pollute the forum of discourse from be able to search for answer reasonably . 
counterpoint : it be exactly because of the visceral response it cause that flag burning be such an effective tool of protest . it draw medium and public attention , thus give the protestors the chance to speak to a wide audience than they might ever have be able to have they use other method . while there might be some rhetorical backlash , it be not enough to make it not worthwhile . in the case of violent response , the ability to exercise a right should never be infringe by the potential for a violent response to it exercise . people's right should be well protect in that case , not restrict . 
point : all national poll conduct in the united states have show a majority popular support for ban flag burning1 . state and federal law , pass by democratically elect representative , have for decade pass popularly support law aim at protect the flag from desecration . the supreme court , however , have strike down these law a be contrary to the right to free speech , by a narrow 5 4 vote2 . yet popular support for such law have not diminish . this have lead to attempt to pass a flag desecration amendment to the constitution , which would then necessarily have to be accept by the court . in 2006 , the house of representatives pass such an amendment by the requisite supermajority , and it die in the senate by only a single vote3 . clearly , the vast majority of citizen and legislator actively support legislation to protect the flag . law should reflect the will of the people and prevent the desecration of the nation's most sacred symbol . failing to do so give precedence to the right of a small minority to perform an act that do not hold any major sway over their life over the democratic right of the democratic public . 
counterpoint : popular support be not reason enough to deny people their constitutionally protect right . the framer of the constitution be wary of popular opinion , have a justifiable fear that the majority might try to circumscribe the right of the minority . this be why there be so many check and balance within the constitution and be exactly why the supreme court have defend citizens' right to expression irrespective of the will of the legislature or of the majority of people to enforce their view upon a minority . popular opinion should not concern fundamental right .
