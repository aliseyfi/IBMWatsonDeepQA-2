point : advertising aim at child brings negative social consequence , a much of it be for food and drink that be very unhealthy with james rouse1 state that in the us over 10 billion be spend annually advertise fast food towards child . encouraging gullible child to consume so much fatty , sugary and salty food be unethical because it create obese , unhealthy youngster , with bad eat habit that will be with them for life . society also have to pay a high price in term of the extra medical care such child will eventually require , so the government have a direct interest in prevent advertisement which contribute to this problem . 
counterpoint : children naturally like food that be rich in fat , protein and sugar ; they give them the energy they need to play energetically and grow healthily . it be true that eat only such food be bad for people , but this be a problem of bad parent rather than the fault of advertising . to suggest that the eating habit , good or bad , stay with child throughout the rest of their life be ridiculous , when child become adult they will for good or for bad make their own decision . also if advertising to child be ban then government would not be able to use this mean of promote healthy eating , road safety , hygiene , and other socially useful message . 
point : advertising specifically to child be unethical because they have little or no money of their own and have to persuade their parent to buy the product for them . rather than advertise directly to parent , company use a nag and whine campaign that lead to hostility between parent and child . they rely on pester power to make adult spend money they don't have on thing they don't want to buy , and which their child may well only play with for a few hour for example . advertising which present product to child a must have be also socially divisive , make child whose parent cannot afford them appear inferior , and create feeling of frustration and inadequacy , as well a lead family into debt . 1 
counterpoint : advertising have no magical power to create unnatural desire for material possession , children who persistently nag be simply badly bring up . poor parenting and undisciplined child cannot be solve by ban advertising , a child have many influence upon them which can stimulate their desire for toy , particularly their friend . it be also untrue that child have no spending power of their own ; many child receive pocket money , and teenager be often able to earn a little themselves . natasha smith1 estimate that the average annual amount of pocket money child age 12 18 be give in the uk be 1 , 028 , which equate to 19 . 77 a week . 
point : there be a good precedent for ban advertising aim at child in the restriction place in most country upon advertising tobacco and alcohol . it also take a stand against increasingly exploitative marketing campaign that ruthlessly target child . in the usa marketing company be already offer school free television in exchange for their student be force to watch a certain amount of programming and advertisement each day , and sell marketing data on those child . it be time that childhood be protect from such commercialization . such a ban would be limited such a be only prevent advertising aim at child rather than an outright attempt to stop child from see advert . companies could therefore still advertise their children's product if they aim their advert at the parent rather than the child . alternatively the ban could be prevent advertising at time when child be most likely to be watch the television a have happen in sweden . 1 
counterpoint : even limit ban be unlikely to be effective and would set a bad precedent which be likely to result in ever more restriction upon the freedom of expression . children watch many programme that adult also enjoy , and some adult be also particularly suggestible ; should we then extend this ban to all television advertising . and why stop at television when child be also expose to radio , cinema , the internet and billboard in the street a well ? perhaps company should also be ban from sponsor entertainment and sport event for child , and prevent from provide free branded resource for school . on the other hand , any restriction will be impossible to enforce a television be increasingly broadcast by satellite across national border and cannot easily be control nor can the internet . 
point : advertising towards child cannot be consider ethical a child have not yet fully develop their mental cognition . they lack the complete toolset to view advertising critically and advertiser take advantage of this , disregard any negative effect it may have on child and society more generally . 
counterpoint : advertisers be subject to strict regulation to ensure that child be not take advantage at time when they be still develop mental skill set . however child live in a commercialized world and should not be entirely shield from it a without be subject to some advertising child will never be able to learn fully how to critically engage with advertising . advertisers recognize that they must be careful in advertising to child so many go above and beyond the standard regulation to ensure that any advertising towards child they do be socially responsible with many company sign up to self regulation code such a the aana code for advertising marketing communications to children . 1
