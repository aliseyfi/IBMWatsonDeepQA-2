point : a pupil be unable to give or withhold their consent to participate in school prayer . this be because the school environment do not facilitate the free exercise of consent . it mandate attendance , it be deliver in an inherently instructional facility , and it subject be immature , have underdeveloped faculty of resistance and consent , and be subject to the pressure of their peer . the supreme court in santa fe independent school district v . doe recognise the significance of social influence upon pupil exert by colleague and staff , and that in any school environment , a prayer will be see a an approve action by the school which be unconstitutional 1 . a pupil do not opt into the practice of prayer the practice typically take place in the context of an assembly at which attendance be compulsory . the consent of the pupil to the prayer be therefore not seek but merely presume . 
counterpoint : the provision of formal prayer do not invalidate the consent of the child concern . should a child or parent of guardian object to the practice of prayer , the child be entitle to refrain from participation . pupils consistently exercise their consent in their education , from the curricular and extra curricular option choose , to the dress worn , to the food eaten . no one ought to defend a school curriculum or staff member that be consider to manipulate the consent of the child concern . however , there be nothing inherent in the school environment that impair the consent of a child to prayer . a child might of course feel a small and perhaps significant degree of social isolation from not participate in the prayer . nevertheless , this sentiment be the necessary price of 
point : religious discrimination be completely unacceptable and should certainly not be condone or even facilitate by a school . yet , in order to be meaningful , a prayer must also be discriminatory between different religious belief . the imprecation of one deity a oppose to another or several others , the choice of language and the supplication seek be distinctive to each faith . the incorporation of any or all such address into a single prayer at best confuses it meaning , and at bad render it meaningless 1 . where the practical precatory choice be between discrimination and equivocation no school prayer should be permit . 
counterpoint : non denominational prayer preserve an equilibrium between different faith by be non specific it allow the individual to impose their own belief on what be be say . it can even offer a valuable moment of reflection for the atheist . moreover , the prohibition of school prayer do in fact amount to religious discrimination . the practice simply prefer the atheist , who do not adhere to formal religious worship , to the follower of any religious faith . 
point : the court in pierce v . society of sisters and wisconsin v . yoder recognise that the liberty of parent and guardian to direct the upbringing of child under their control extend to the religious faith that be impart to the child 1 . the proper purpose of school be not indoctrination . should religion be consider a valuable part of a balanced curriculum , it ought to be teach in a broad and critical context in the classroom . a formal prayer instills obedience to a faith that the child might neither understand nor accept and to which the parent or guardian might properly object . the practice do not stimulate discussion or debate and therefore have no place in school . 
counterpoint : the guidance of parent or guardian be wholly compatible with the formal school prayer . first , the primary caregiver of the child can simply direct the child not to attend the prayer , in the alternative or in addition to request the school not to permit the child to participate in this activity . second , the proposition argument tend heavily towards the hysterical . an american public high school do not typically embrace the jesuit aphorism of take a child and building a believer for life 1 . a brief prayer , perhaps even convey a nondenominational message , be exceedingly unlikely to confuse a child or damage the teaching of the parent or guardian . third , a school necessarily and properly stand in loco parentis of it pupil . it be entirely proper that , in the absence of expression to the contrary on behalf of the parent or guardian , the school should make the deliberately paternalistic choice to hold a school prayer for the pupil . fourth , if a court or legislator could ever be so presumptuous a to tender a definition of the purpose of schooling , it should reasonably include the spiritual development of it subject . a moment of prayer or reflection be consequently a valuable and not supererogatory element of the curriculum . 
point : if regulation be to change and prayer allow base upon the expressed desire of student and parent , it would be almost impossible to ensure that each individual be receive what they or their parent would consider the proper exposure to faith or religion . not only would it be logistically difficult and disruptive to allow student not to attend public prayer , it would also be very difficult to ensure that this be be do . only by ensure that it be not allow can this problem be solve that way those who do want to pray be of course still able to do so and those who do not want to be a part of it or whose parent don't wish them to be involve may not be force into do so . evidence for this can actually be see from an attempt to ensure that school carry out prayer in wales where it be a legal obligation . the school standards and framework act 1998 set out that every pupil shall on each school day take part in an act of collective worship . 1 a bbc survey show in fact that less than half of the school inspect carry out this obligation 2 and equally if school in america be permit to conduct prayer , the level of continuity and the monitoring of whether or not the right of the child under the constitution be be breach would be an impossible task . 
counterpoint : it would surely be no less of a task than check to see that prayer be not carry out at all . if they be allow , individual would be able to make their own choice a to participate and there would be no need for the government to get involved and waste money over the issue . if anything this simply show that a blanket policy in either direction be unsustainable , and that allow individual state and school district to make their own decision be the best way to ensure that people get what they want from their time at school .
