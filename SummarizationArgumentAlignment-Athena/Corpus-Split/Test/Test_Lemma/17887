point : tourism vastly increase income within a particular state or region , not only through direct spending by tourist , but also a a result of increase in tax revenue and the growth of local market for food , service and luxury good . tourism provide a boost to the amount of capital available in an area that purely local spending cannot achieve , even if assist by government subsidy or tax break for domestic business . 
counterpoint : even if the tourist trade be use a a launch pad for an economy seek diversity and stability , it must still consent to spend an extended period of time completely dependent on the fund of tourist and tour operator . this constitute a significant risk . there be no guarantee that a particular state or region will remain a popular tourist destination . further , tourist lead economy be highly vulnerable to the effect of natural disaster , political and humanitarian disaster such a war and pandemic and financial fluctuation . 
point : forming close tie with resource extraction firm and manufacturer be a popular development strategy for many poor state , but it offer significant disadvantage in comparison to tourism . not only do resource extraction , by it very nature , require state to consent to it territory sustain pervasive and long term environmental damage , it also tend to incentivise infrastructure project that be only of use to the resource extraction industry . roads can ferry medical supply to community a easily a they ferry tourist . an oil pipeline will only ever be useful for transport oil . 
counterpoint : while the resolution may suggest that income from tourism will serve to adjust the inequality in bargain power between the poor residence of tourist destination and wealthy tour firm , an area s identity a a tourist destination often inhibit development . the purchase of land by tour company may expropriate exist occupant who hold land subject to poorly defined right or customary principle that be not recognise in court of law . the repurposing of land to serve the tourist trade often exclude the possibility of economic diversification land occupy by a hotel cannot also be use a farmland . the construction of port inhibit the development of marine life across a wide area of surround coast line . governments may be reluctant to intervene to address economic inequality of this type , for fear that seize a firm s asset might prompt capital flight or costly legal challenge . 
point : managed properly , tourism and the conservation of wildlife habitat and area of archaeological significance need not be mutually exclusive activity . indeed , recent trend in ecotourism have demonstrate that tourists themselves can be co opt to monitor and survey the environment that they be visit . the fee pay by tourist to gain access to heritage location such a pompeii , the valley of king and machu pichu can be funnel into restoration and preservation scheme on those site . 
counterpoint : the damage that tourists cause be not limit to archaeological site and local ecosystem . the presence of tourist can also destabilise and perturb the routine and tradition of an area s community . within develop state , tourist can cause significant disruption and damage to the pattern of ordinary life . religious , artistic , medical and agricultural knowledge be consider to be an important resource by a wide range of aboriginal and forth world community . what tourists may assume to be innocent query can constitute an attempt to acquire carefully taught skill and practice , bound closely to a group s identity and history .
