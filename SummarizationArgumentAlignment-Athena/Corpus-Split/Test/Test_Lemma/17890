point : wikipedia exist to provide free , open and easy access to information and knowledge . its goal be to distribute a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet in their own language , and to an astonishing degree it be succeed . 1 it already have over 3 . 5 million article in english alone . 2 this be more than ten time those of encyclopaedia britannica , it near print rival . traditionally , reference work be very expensive , which mean previously that knowledge be restrict to the wealthy , or those with access to well funded public library . wikipedia liberate that knowledge and provide volume of online information to anyone with access to a computer , or even a smartphone , and the internet . its impact be only restrain by the reach of internet provider and the desire of people to learn . users do not need to be able to afford particular print object but can access content of wikipedia from any location with internet connectivity . 
counterpoint : wikipedia do not provide free , open access to knowledge , for it only apply to those who already have access to both a computer and internet access . furthermore , since very few computer retailer or internet service provider be willing to provide their service free of charge , to declare wikipedia free be disingenuous ; there be substantial charge before wikipedia can be utilize . moreover while wikipedia may provide free open access to knowledge this be mostly for those who speak english . those who need this resource be those who speak much small language but a yet wikipedia be not a good resource in these language . the punjabi wikipedia only have 3 , 000 article 1 despite it be a language with more than sixty million speaker . 2 . lastly , whilst wikipedia have advantage over traditional print encyclopaedia , tangible object have the advantage of never go offline and therefore be able to provide their information constantly . 
point : the process of collaboration require to create and maintain an up to date , factual source of information encourages democratic practice and principle . wikipedia seek to achieve it democratic goal of the spread of free , open material by democratic mean . as an open source project it rely upon the collaboration of ten of thousand of people who constantly add , check and edit article . disagreements and dispute be send up the line to moderator , who oversee the editing process . this socialisation of expertise a david weinberger put it 1 ensure that error and omission be rapidly identify and correct and that the site be constantly and accurately updated . no traditional encyclopaedia can match this scrutiny . indeed , wikipedia have the potential to be the great effort in collaborative knowledge gather the world have ever know , and it may well be the great effort in voluntary collaboration of any kind . 2 not only do such democratic process encourage democracy more generally , but they be an effective mean to create a user friendly product , a illustrate by open source software such a firefox and linux . 
counterpoint : collaboration in edit do not encourage democratic principle , but merely privilege the loud voice , or in this case , the most regular user . as such , create knowledge by consensus be inherently flaw . a fact be not true simply because lot of people think so . traditional encyclopaedia be write and edit by academic and professional expert , whose reputation be put on the line by the article they produce . they have the credential and expertise that give them the authority to write without require widespread communal feedback . however , anyone can write a wikipedia article , regardless of how much or how little knowledge he or she have of the subject . worse yet , because contributor be effectively anonymous , it be impossible to assess the quality of an article on an unfamiliar topic by assess the credential of those who have produce it . collaboration , therefore , become a barrier to the provision of reliable , accurate and up to date information . 
point : wikipedia pool information that previously be spread far and wide in cyberspace into one readily accessible location . enquiries will not and should not end at wikipedia , but it provide accessible background information as well a link to additional research and publication on a topic and be , therefore , an obvious start point . 1 nobody at wikipedia have claim that it be a definitive account of human knowledge or a replacement for in depth research . but it give a quick guide to an unknown subject and point the enquirer on to more specialist source . it be use to good effect by student , teacher , journalist and even judge , among many others show it be a valued reference source . experienced user can quickly assess the quality of an article from it write quality and the thoroughness of it reference , so they need not accept it content out of hand . nothing on the internet should ever be accept uncritically , but wikipedia have earn it reputation a a valuable start resource . 
counterpoint : wikipedia be a common starting point for enquiry , but not because it be excellent ; it have become a standard source of reference because it be free and easy to access . wikipedia , through it popularity , be often the first search result find when use public search engine like google , which draw user to it information regardless of the reliability that other source may offer . many of it user be student , with too little experience to ascertain the quality of an article but anxious to find the quick and ostensibly most efficient path to the information they require . overdependence on wikipedia mean that student in particular never develop proper research skill and increasingly accept that an approximately right answer be good enough . 1 , 2 middlebury college s history department even ban student from cite wikipedia in paper , 3 and wikipedia founder jimmy wales himself have assert that change to wikipedia be necessary to make it a suitable resource for college student . 4 , 5 
point : a key principle for wikipedia be to present information as neutrally a possible . this have lead to wikipedia be ban in china , after jimmy wales refuse to censor article to make the site acceptable to the chinese government . 1 wikipedia , thus , epitomize the principle that all should have access to the necessary information require not just to live , but also enjoy and cherish our life . as such , wikipedia be not threaten by variant and rival that also seek to promote freedom of knowledge because it view them a partner to a mutual goal , not rival . its founder , jimmy wales , readily acknowledge it will eventually be supersede by another way of share knowledge on a mass level . 2 
counterpoint : no organisation can succeed in be completely neutral and unbiased a be show by the number of complaint the bbc , which be oblige to be impartial in political matter , 1 get about bias on issue range from politics , 2 3 to israel , 4 5 to climate change . 6 similarly wikipedia can be criticise for it inbuilt bias , intolerant of dissent view . even wikipedians themselves acknowledge that it topic coverage be slant . 7 religious conservative object to the secular liberal approach it editor consistently take and have find that their attempt to add balance to entry be swiftly reject . this bias even extend to the censorship of fact which raise question about the theory of evolution . some conservative be so worried about the widespread use of wikipedia to promote a liberal agenda in education that they have set up conservapedia a a rival source of information . 8 
point : through the process by which it article be construct , wikipedia support notion of revision , collaboration , and authority that many academic value and help to make visible the knowledge making process . 1 with it discussion and history page , wikipedia illustrate the peer review process academic writing go through as well a the iterative , recursive nature of public writing . thus , it can disabuse student of the notion that good writing happens in isolation in one sitting . therefore , wikipedia can be an excellent teaching tool . 2 3 
counterpoint : wikipedia may document the process of creation of encyclopaedia article , but it do not illustrate the kind of research write we should be teach student . academic peer review be limit to expert reader . while expert reader can participate in wikipedia , their voice be often drown out by the less knowledgeable mass . moreover , wikipedia discourage appropriate source use and citation practice . not only do student frequently plagiarize from wikipedia , 1 but they also plagiarize in contribute to it . 2
