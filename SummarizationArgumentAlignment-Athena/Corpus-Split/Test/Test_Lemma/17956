point : parenting effectively prevents people from pursue their own interest and fulfil their own goal . the child become the center and the only valid part of parent life . by have kid , people turn from free individual into servant . they often have to abandon their career in order to take care of the offspring . women s career be most heavily affected , a woman usually end up be the major childcare provider . furthermore , people with child have much less time for socialize result in lose friend . couples relationship be also bind to deteriorate a mother and father become more interested in a baby than in themselves . it have also be prove that couple with kid engage in sexual activity far less often than those who be childless . all of these reason contribute to general dissatisfaction of parent who feel they have lose their own life . as the evidence for that we can quote daniel gilbert , who hold a chair in psychology at harvard . based on his research finding , he report that childless marriage be far happy . such a view be support also by madelyn cain , a teacher at the university of southern california , who say statistics show childless couple be happy . their life be self direct , they have a good chance of intimacy , and they do not have the stress , financial and emotional , of parenthood . 
counterpoint : having child be one of the most fulfilling and reward experience in life . when people become parent obviously they experience a major change in their life . however , change doesn t mean a change for bad . raising child be not easy , but it bring about a feeling of fulfillment . for many people , have child be the main purpose in their life . kids enable parent to rediscover the world around them . additionally , parent feel empower a they can shape another human be to a previously inexperienced extent . relationships with kid seem to be the deep , most enduring one . these be the very reason why people become so upset when they cannot have child . the development of treatment such a in vitro fertilization prove how much we want to have baby . there be also substantial evidence support the claim that have child have a constructive rather than destructive influence on parent . dr . luis angeles from the university of glasgow in the uk have just publish in the journal of happiness studies , claim that the research he have conduct suggests that have child improve married peoples' life satisfaction , make them happy . a recent newsweek poll also find that child add to general level of parent happiness . fifty percent of surveyed americans say that add new child to the family tend to increase their happiness level . only one in six 16 percent say that add new child have a negative effect on the parents' happiness . the evidence that have child have a devastating effect be mix at best and in many case outright wrong . 
point : the level of emotional involvement in bring the child up be immense . parents pour all their soul into child , who , in turn , often leave them disenchant and exhaust . parents also have to share their child s problem , fear and trauma , so that the amount of grief that parent take on themselves double or even triple , depend on how troublesome the child be . not only that , but those who have offspring also become more vulnerable . they worry about their kid from the moment they be bear until the day they themselves die . parents to worry about list be endless : from child s nutrition to summer camp , from accident to social acceptance , from choose a school to move out . having raise child , parent become emotional wreck . all parent agree that it be emotionally drain and stressful , in 1975 , advice columnist ann landers ask her reader , if you have it to do over again , would you have child ? seventy percent of respondent say no . 
counterpoint : having child enrich parent emotionally . the experience of parent trigger deep and genuine emotion , which parent would not experience otherwise . attachment , caring , compassion , understanding , moral outrage , joy , and wonder be all inevitably a part of parenting . many parent claim that they have never love anybody as much a their child . thus , have child actually enlarge both the spectrum and the intensity of emotional experience for parent . worrying for kid be a natural consequence of praise them so much . the more valuable something be , the more attention we pay to it . the fact that parent worry about their child that much be only a further evidence of how much child s contribution mean to parent . 
point : for majority of people child be the big expenditure they ever undertake . the united states department of agriculture report in 2008 that the average annual expense associate with raise a child can be as high a 22 , 960 . if we assume that a child will live with their parent until the age of 18 and add average cost of send a child for 4 year to college , we arrive at the conclusion that bring up a child in a developed country cost around 500 , 000 . this money can be far well spent , for instance , on enhance the standard of education or health care , subsidise economic initiative in develop country , invest in green technology , etc . 
counterpoint : any money spend on child be well use . is there a good way to invest money than to use them to support future generation ? the more we spend on child s health care , the more productive our society will be ; the more we spend on their education , the wise our society will be ; the more we spend on their cultural awareness , the more conscious of art our society will be . there be no good use of money than spend them on our kid . 
point : four out of every five child will be bear to family whose member survive on less than 10 a day . around one third of child in develop country be estimate to be underweight or stunt . research suggest that even in the usa , 20 of child live in poverty . and such an extreme plight of the child be only the beginning . even if a child be bear into a relatively well off family , there be endless devastating situation he have to face during his life : war , death of family member , chronic illness , divorce , crime , and social exclusion . the list can go on and on forever . having child be the equivalent of force innocent people , against their will , to experience the misery of life . thus , it be inhumane . 
counterpoint : there be no good present for somebody than to give him a life . our life be not just about money . there be so many valuable emotion , situation , experience that have nothing to do with wealth level , for example fall in love or simply be enchant by the world s beauty . even if the child be bear to an impoverish family that doesn t mean he win t be able to rise out of the poverty . there be numerous sponsored programme that encourage social mobility in both developing and developed country . however , we need to accept this simple truth that life be not a sequence of only joyful event , and sometimes we have to experience a difficult situation to be able to appreciate all the good out there . additionally , positive experience in life usually outweigh those negative , that s why a vast majority of u would never change our life for not be bear . therefore , give a child a life be more than morally right . 
point : the more people consume in the world , the great the environmental damage . an average american produce 52 ton of garbage by the age of 75 . however , produce extra litter and pollution be not the only hazard that every child pose to the planet . increasing world s population also place incredible stress on earth s resource . it be estimate , for instance , that by 2025 three billion people will live in water scarce country . by reduce the number of human being we will manage to avoid numerous overpopulation crisis and reverse the damage do to the environment . 
counterpoint : not have child be not a good way to combat environmental problem . the real answer to environmental issue be develop clean technology and promote ecological awareness . if we start to produce energy from renewable resource , switch to electrical transportation , recycle waste etc . we win t need to reduce population in order to sustain the environment . furthermore , a high population living in a more eco friendly manner would be less harmful than the current level of population with it lifestyle . 
point : social and economic inequality between men and woman stem primarily from the fact that woman be the child bearer , and mother overwhelmingly spend more time on childrearing task than do their male spouse . not surprisingly then , many employer still discriminate against woman when recruit to work . they view female a those responsible for parent and thus not reliable , devote or loyal a employee . even when there be little or no discrimination in recruitment woman often hit a glass ceiling due to break their career in order to have child , in the uk a recent report by the chartered management institute find it would take until 2109 to close the pay gap . on a social level , not have child will mean more gender equality a there will be no ground for justify an unequal labour division . 
counterpoint : there be good way of eliminate gender inequality . first of all , inequality between sex be far more complex of an issue than the proposition would like u to believe . there be many reason why gender inequality prevail in the society . they be ground in different physical , psychological and social feature of male and female . moreover , they date back to prehistoric time when men and woman occupy themselves with different task and have different responsibility . it be too simplistic to say that by not have child gender inequality will be eradicate . furthermore , there be other more effective and less damaging way of head towards equality between sex , such a education , affirmative action and social policy encourage men to participate in childcare on equal basis with woman .
