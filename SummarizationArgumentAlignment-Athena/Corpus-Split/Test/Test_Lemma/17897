point : as new member be accept and the schengen area expand , it become more and more difficult to police . for example , once terrorist have gain access to the area , they be free to move within almost the entirety of europe . the same applies for trafficker of people , drug and arm . this be the rationale behind the blocking of romania and bulgaria from enter the zone at the same time a they enter the eu 1 ; they fail to curb organise crime before their accession and if they be join access route would be open to the whole of europe . 
counterpoint : the expand schengen area do not make it more difficult to police due to the lack of border control . anyone attempt to enter the schengen area will be check at least once , this be exactly the same a anyone enter an individual country . americans do not consider themselves less safe because they do not have border post between maryland and virginia . the key therefore be not to dissolve schengen but to ensure that all country border police be of equally high quality and that they share information a be be do through the schengen information system sis 1 and europol . 
point : the borderless nature of the schengen area make it increasingly difficult to track and detain illegal immigrant . it be often easy for illegal immigrant to enter through country such a italy or greece and , a be fear when bulgaria and romania eventually join , eastern european country and then continue on to country like france and germany 1 . for example , italian prime minister berlusconi's decision to grant temporary residence permit to more than 20 , 000 tunisian migrant flee the violent uprising in april , be make in the knowledge that many of the migrant would end up travel to france , the former colonial ruler where many of the migrant have relative 2 . france accuse italy of abuse the schengen agreement . 
counterpoint : through the sis the schengen area have be able to streamline immigration and asylum policy , thus make it easy to manage immigrant in a consistent manner across europe 1 . however , country be not wholly dependent on external border for security and immigration check , and so immigrant approach from external country can still be catch by individual country within the schengen area . police be allow to conduct random identity check throughout the territory of any particular member state : travel advice for schengen country warn that while there be no longer any land border check , you should not to attempt to cross land border without a valid travel document because it be likely that random identity check will be make in area surround the border 2 . 
point : the schengen area , adopt by some country in europe but not others , will create a difference of interest which will irrevocably divide the eu over time . the fact that not all the eu member be part of the schengen agreement mean that the eu be divide in two area : one in which the free movement of people be achieve and one in which it be not . this threaten to create two different way of approach the question of justice and security within the eu : one that be manage through the sis system and europol , and one that be manage through the traditional justice and home affair legislation within the union framework itself . this could turn out to be a particularly divisive force within a union that be already falter have fail to sign a common constitution and settle for a water down treaty instead . 
counterpoint : while the eu be indeed a union , it be also a union of state with recognize right to shape their own security and justice affair . unlike the continental member of the eu , britain and ireland have traditionally look at border not a source of conflict but rather a natural mechanism of defence , because of their position a island . the schengen agreement have allow them to also collaborate within the sis and europol , thus complement the traditional framework of the union , of which , ultimately , the schengen agreement be a part 1 . this mean that britain and ireland be as include a they wish to be . the split in the schengen agreement will not result in any new difference of interest between britain and ireland and the rest of the eu . 
point : the schengen agreement have open internal border within europe , but externally the opposite be true . thus , while citizen of the belonging country enjoy complete freedom of movement , citizen of non member country find that it be more difficult to receive entry visa to enter the schengen area . as the schengen area continue to expand , it enforce more and more restriction on country that lie outside it border , turn border that have historically be open into real fortress and thus significantly affect the political and economic relation between long term ally . for example , the eastern border of east european states that already enjoy some schengen privilege be harden in order to be allow fully into schengen a the exist member need to agree that they be implement border control satisfactorily . 1 the result be that they be cut their inhabitant off from neighbour such a ukraine , belarus and russia in order to give them good access to western europe . former member of yugoslavia that before schengen be implement could travel to all the member of the ec such a macedonia have have travel restriction impose and this burden have be increase a more of their neighbour , such a slovenia , join the zone or make free travel arrangement with it such a serbia and croatia . 2 
counterpoint : while have to get a europe wide visa can be a problem for the country that newly border the schengen there be also benefit . the schengen agreement often favour those who apply for schengen visa since once a visa be grant , they can easily travel throughout all the country that have sign the agreement . this process not only save money but it also allow for more freedom of movement for those who enter the schengen area under a visa regime . countries be free to choose whether they want to become part of the schengen regime or not , and be thus make a rational and informed decision on whether the schengen agreement serve them good than maintain open border with traditional ally that be not part of the schengen area . 
point : since the schengen agreement be first design and implement the world have move on and become a much more dangerous place . the war on terror have already bring bombing to a number of european city , and this change circumstance make schengen a luxury the eu can no longer afford . september 11th have create a preoccupation with the security of the union s external border . 1 even before september 11th 2001 the drawback of open border in term of crime be obvious which be why paris controversially impose stricter check against drug flow into france from the more relaxed regime in the netherlands use a broad interpretation of the rule for temporary issue of public order . 2 since 9 11 there be a press need for stricter border control to catch international terrorist and prevent the movement of dangerous material which could be use in terror attack . 
counterpoint : scrapping the schengen agreement in the face of terrorism would be to give in to the terrorist . the agreement be part of the open , free society which the extremist be attack , with it aim of cooperation between different nationality and the development of a peaceful european identity . retreating behind national border would only encourage them in their attack , and would be ineffective in seek to prevent future violence . investigation of attack in madrid , london and paris have all reveal that the terrorist be legal resident , free to come and go regardless of border restriction . rather than dissolve schengen the solution to terrorism lie in good intelligence gathering and cooperation between state not likely to be encourage by a retreat behind national border , and by address the problem of alienation and poverty within our society which serve a breed ground for extremism .
