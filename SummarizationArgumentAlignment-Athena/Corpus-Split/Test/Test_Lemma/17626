point : hypermarkets and mall promote competition and so serve consumer well . because of their huge purchasing power and economy of scale , large retail chain with huge outlet such a wal mart , tescos and carrefour can offer product much more cheaply than small high street rival . the convenience and great enjoyment offer by out of town mall can also push urban shopping centre into improve their own provision for consumer . this can be see through improvement in the urban environment , good policing , cheap parking and more ease of access , and the provision of entertainment and special event e . g . farmer market , foreign market and street festival to draw shopper in from a wider area . the public have vote with their foot , in 2003 48 of everything buy in britain be buy in out of town stores1 . 
counterpoint : out of town retail development actually reduce effective competition because small urban outlet be not able to compete with them on price . in the united states for example , wal mart pay worker the bare minimum and import good produce for a lot cheap overseas1 . local store cannot compete . after a while the urban shopping centre will become hollow out , with most store shut and only a few niche retailer or store cater to poorer and less mobile social group remain . once this competition be remove , the out of town store can put up their own price , especially a mall and other out of town retail centre be actively plan to reduce direct competition within particular retail sector e . g . only one large food retailer , only one do it yourself store , only , only a few shoe shop , etc . . 
point : out of town centre bring development in their wake . as out of town centre be often build on aesthetically unappealing brownfield site , the injection of large investment by a retailer be a vote of confidence in the area and this have a knock on effect in the local economy . the out of town centre act a a magnet for further positive development locally . other amenity and housing will typically start to congregate near the shop and the centre create a boom for the local economy . this be not only true in the initial construction stage , it will also apply once it be up and running , a retail staff will typically be recruit fairly locally . in edinburgh , the multi million development of the out of town shopping centre in livingston be believe to have create more than 1500 job alone1 . 
counterpoint : out of town centre distort urban growth pattern . because they be not organic growth , out of town centre often warp local infrastructure provision . so , while for example they may have good access road build , there will be few amenity build at the same time , and subsequent residential development which follow in the path often grow too quickly to incorporate the sort of planned town infrastructure which develop in more traditional , carefully plan town centre environment . because out of town centre often do not clearly serve a particular residential area , they distort growth a it mean that , rather than respond to a residential area's need , the centre be build and attract residential development around it for convenience , regardless of whether this be the most appropriate planning approach for local community . 
point : out of town mall offer a good shopping experience . it be easy for shopper to visit an out of town retail development than an urban or town centre shop area . typically , out of town mall offer access road which be not crowd and plenty of free car parking . this be welcome by shopper and be in contrast to many city centre or high street shop area . it be also convenient for shopper to be able to make their purchase under one roof . in an out of town shopping centre , shopper be typically able to complete their purchase in one cover mall , and perhaps even in one giant store . this be less time consume and less stressful than the more traditional experience of need to visit multiple different shop . in addition , the interior of shopping centre be actively manage and so be typically clean , relatively safe and may offer their own entertainment e . g . skate rink , cinema , live music . this be typically less true of more traditional shopping area , where for example at night poor lighting may be off put to some shopper . as retail outlet in town continue to close , britain report grow demand for out of town shopping vacancies1 . 
counterpoint : out of town mall do not serve shopper interest well . it be time consume for shopper to visit out of town centre because of their distance from population centre and the tendency for their access road quickly to become clogged with traffic . this can eradicate any time save from the convenience of have shop or retail category cluster in a single geographical location . they also marginalise part of society . for example , people without access to car be effectively exclude from actively use them . this especially affect some social group , e . g . the poor and the elderly . ultimately , if out of town mall reduce their town centre shopping option , they will have less not more shopping choice .
