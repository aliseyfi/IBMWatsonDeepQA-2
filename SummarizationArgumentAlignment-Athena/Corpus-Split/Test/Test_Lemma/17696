point : prisoners be more likely to ease comfortably and peacefully back into civilian life if , whilst in prison , they retain link with the democratic process . enfranchisement confers not only self worth and meaning within a society , but can encourage research and engagement with contemporary issue . to deny this right be to force 'the disinherit to sit idly by while others elect his civil leader and while others choose the fiscal and governmental policy which will govern him and his family'1 . such an outcome conveys to prisoner that not only they commit a crime , but that they commit that crime because they be incapable of act in a manner fit for society . mistakes make by otherwise altogether rational , beneficial member of society should not be punish by prevent their say in how that society be run . 1 johnson parris , a . s . 2003 . felon disenfrachisement : the unconscionable social contract breached . virginia law review , 109 138 . 2 
counterpoint : prisoners care little about the politician and political process that put them in jail , therefore enfranchisement would do nothing to discourage them from re offending . these be citizen who have show that their mean to correct suppose wrong be not that political process or the rule of law , but crime . prison should be about deter criminal from re offend through take away their right , like freedom , and demonstrate to them the price pay if you act contrary to the interest of society at large . that would be effective a part of their rehabilitation . 
point : prisoners remain human being . we should respect their human right and should infringe upon their liberty as little a possible , except where it concern the protection of the public . denying prisoner the right to vote do not protect the public in any way and be therefore an unwarranted infringement upon the human right of prisoner . as the u . s . congress decree in 1993 , 'the right of citizen to vote be a fundamental right'1 . those right which be unalienable should not be lose when one be incarcerate . 1 u . s . congress . 2003 , may 20 . civil rights division . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from the united states department of justice : 3 
counterpoint : prisoners remain human being but the right to vote be not fundamental , for it be not grant to all ; only the trusted member of society be grant the right to vote ; minors , for example , be deem not responsible enough and therefore have to wait until they be a certain age for the right to vote . prisoners be deem similarly irresponsible and therefore strip of their right . as the u . s . supreme court order in 2000 , the law 'does not protect the right of all citizen to vote , but rather the right of all qualified citizen to vote'1 . prisoners disqualify themselves through their action ; if , a a british member of parliament put it , the court deem a prisoner unfit for normal society , how can it be sensible to give them a sayin how that society be run ? 2 
point : the refusal to grant prisoner the right to vote 'is not demonstrably justify in a free and democratic society'1 . such society pride themselves on the participation of all in the political process , regardless of wealth , class , gender or sexual orientation . the objective of such system , to ensure that all view be represent fairly and voter represent equally , do not stop at the gate of a prison . issues such a prison overcrowding and abuse by warder be not treat seriously a political issue , since those most directly affect cannot vote and the public generally have little interest in prisoners' well be . prisoners should also have the opportunity to influence the formation of policy on healthcare , education , the environment and all the other issue that affect the world into which almost all of them will someday be release . prisoners be not treat a civically dead when it benefit the state : they be liable for taxation on any earnings and saving that they have . there should be no taxation without representation . 1 ctv news . 2002 , november 1 . supreme court back prisoners' right to vote . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from ctv news : 6 
counterpoint : if prisoner refuse to act responsibly in a democratic system , why should their view and need be represent ? as regard the claim that since they pay tax , they deserve representation , in practice few prisoner earn enough to be liable for taxation . in any case , the right to vote do not follow from the obligation to pay tax . in many country , people start earn money and pay tax before they be old enough to vote particularly if they leave school as soon a they be allow to do so . this imply that the right to vote be give to those who can be expect to use it responsibly . those convict of serious enough crime to be imprison have show that they have no respect for society and , give the vote , would 'make a mockery of justice'1 . they therefore cannot be trust to vote responsibly in the interest of society ; many would probably simply vote for candidate promise light sentence for criminal . prisoners' interest be already represent by ngos and statutory prison inspection body , which ensure that they be not ill treat . they do not deserve any further representation . 1 bbc news . 2001 , march 21 . prisoners' vote right bid attack . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from bbc news : 5 
point : the right to vote be enshrine in the constitution or legislation of all democratic state and their collective part . governments , national and state , and their elect official be charge with pass the change to such document that would permit or deny the right to vote to specific group in society . in the united states , only two state , main and virginia , have law allow incarcerated felon to vote1 . in australia , a 2008 high court ruling pass the right to vote to all felon serve sentence of three year of less2 . both example prove the capacity of the state legislature to rule on the issue of the prisoner's right to vote . 1 gramlich , j . 2008 , september 23 groups push to expand ex felon voting . retrieved june 21 , 2011 from stateline : 7 2 maley , p . 2008 high court let prisoner vote . retrieved june 21 , 2011 from wall street journal : 8 
counterpoint : a legislative mechanism on it own be insufficient to determine whether prisoner be grant the right to vote in any specific environment ; a public and political will must also be present . when the european court of human rights rule that the british denial of prisoners' right to vote be a breach of the european convention on human rights , public outcry in britain , both among the general population and in parliament , prevent the passing of new legislation1 . in february of 2011 , the british parliament vote 234 to 22 in favor of maintain the ban , in direct repudiation of the european court's insistence that the law be changed2 . 1 press association 2010 , november 2 prisoners to get the right to vote . retrieved june 21 , 2011 from the guardian 9 2 stringer , d . 2011 , february 10 uk lawmakers vote to deny prisoners right to vote . retrieved june 21 , 2011 , from abc news : 10 
point : many people who commit serious crime be not send to prison because of their age , the effect upon their dependent or the likelihood that they will not re offend . others commit equivalent or less crime , without these special circumstance , may be imprison . even if it be ever right to deprive people of the vote a a punishment , this should not automatically be associate with imprisonment , but should be decide separately , a in france and germany . as the australian democrats argue , 'to deny the right to vote be to impose an additional penalty on top of that judged appropriate by the court'1 . 1 allison , l . 2006 , november 1 . voting rights of prisoners . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from australian democrats : 12 
counterpoint : the suppose arbitrary nature of disenfranchisement for prisoner be not an argument for let all , or indeed any , prisoner vote . the imposition of a prison sentence be a good general index of the seriousness of a crime , and those who have commit serious crime should suffer civic death . where people be exceptionally not imprison , they should be deprive of the right to vote for the period for which they would usually have be imprison . as david cameron have admit , 'it make me physically ill to contemplate give the vote to prisoner . they should lose some right include the right to vote'11 quinn , b . 2011 , april 12 . prisoners' vote right : government lose final appeal in european court . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from guardian : 13
