point : a graduate tax be the best way to increase access to high education without massively burden the government with an open end financial commitment . it be not a deterrent to the poorer student in the way fee and loan base scheme be and which simply appear to block access , yet it still deliver sufficient extra capital to fund the increase of student enter university . australia s introduction of a graduate tax have be successful enough to allow university place to grow rapidly follow it introduction with participation from both high and low income group increase by approximately one third . chapman , b . 1997 . therefore , a graduate tax remove the expensive barrier to entry that have previously keep out low income group , whilst not discourage the high income group from tertiary education . 
counterpoint : the prospect of life long higher tax status will in fact act a a deterrent to many weak student who doubt their ability to make a success of a university degree , or those from poor background with no family tradition of high education . introducing a graduate tax will simply come across a penalize those who want to go into high education rather than encourage it . the real key to improve access to high education lie in both good secondary education , a at present many potentially able student be fail by poor school and be unable to achieve the qualification need to go on to university and by provide more bursary for those from disadvantage background . 
point : a graduate tax would potentially give university more than they get from traditional funding , a a contribution would depend directly on a person s salary rather than just be a flat rate fare for service render over a short time . for example a person earn 40 , 000 would pay about 125 per month . shepard , j . 2009 that over 20 year could amount to 30 , 000 , more than enough to cover the cost of a university education in a way which be manageable . admittedly that sum be base on a person rise like a rocket but it still hint at the possibility of the tax and how it could bring in more money than simply university rise their fee . secondly , it would change a a person s salary rise or fall over a twenty year period , be more sustainable and increase the chance of the cost be recover . thirdly , rather than give a person a required fee to pay it would be give a person a chance to pay over a set time period , reduce the financial impact of the bill . 
counterpoint : the main problem with the proposition argument be the belief that a graduate will be earn 40 , 000 immediately after leave university , this be clearly not the case , particularly in the current economic climate , the average starting wage for a graduate be in 2009 23 , 500 with only one in ten exceed 36 , 000 . milkround , 2009 the argument do in part accept this weakness however what it do not point out be that many career which require a university degree may never pay great than 40 , 000 . what a graduate tax focus on be get a job after university , this be not always the reason that people wish to go to university , take for example a mature student who just want to self good themselves , could they still get access to education when the system would be build upon get young people into work ? university should not be commoditized , it should be consider sacred in it own right ; introduce a graduate tax turn university into a mean to get a career rather than be a place of pure education . 
point : a graduate tax would be fair for everyone in society . graduates earn considerably more than non graduate , on average over 100 , 000 more in a lifetime channel 4 news , 2010 . , experience low rate of unemployment and great job security , they therefore benefit hugely from high education . they should therefore be expect to pay for the privilege of have an education which have put them in that position rather than have the rest of society fund there degrees , go to university should be an honor and not a privilege . while have a degree be useful it be not necessary for get on with life , if someone want to go to university they should have that opportunity regardless of their background but they should be expect to contribute to that education which be why the graduate tax work a student of all social class can join university , not be load with debt and can contribute fiscally when viable . 
counterpoint : as high earner , graduate already pay a lot more on average in tax over their lifetime , while consume less in welfare payment , thus more than repay their debt to society . in addition , the whole of society gain from high education through increase economic growth and prosperity , and from the social mobility and integration that open access to university promotes . if the cost of high education be an investment in the country s future , it be appropriate for the government to fund it out of general taxation . in any case , the argument that an individual doesn t use a particular government service , so why should they pay for it , could apply elsewhere and undermine most aspect of government activity and the taxation that pay for it .
