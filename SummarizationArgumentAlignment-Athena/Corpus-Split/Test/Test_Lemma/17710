point : a tobin tax would reduce speculative trading and facilitate real trade and investment . as of 2010 , 3 . 98 trillion dollar change hand every day on global foreign exchange market . more than 80 of this trading be buy and sell money for profit s sake . 1 this speculation have play a crucial role in the current financial crisis , as well a those in the 1990s . in a crisis situation , currency trade swiftly increase and dealer often act a a herd and cause a rapid economic breakdown . a minimal tax would not hold back productive business transaction for trade and investment , but speculative transaction would be hit hard because the great the frequency of transaction , the high the tax charge . in addition , speculation in the international currency market have have a damaging effect , destabilise the economy of many country over the year e . g . britain 1947 1992 , asia in the economic crisis of the late 1990s , argentina since 2000 . by damp down volatility in the currency market while raise money for the un , the tax would be an ideal solution to problem like this . 
counterpoint : there be little evidence that a global tax would reduce market instability and it would certainly not stop speculative attack . however , even a small tax on each transaction could be sufficient to reduce liquidity in financial market and do exactly the opposite lead to an increase in instability . because the tax can t distinguish between speculative activity and dealing to finance trade , all market participant would be subject to the tax . as trade be welfare enhance , public welfare would be reduce to the extent that trade be reduce . the motivation of different trader in financial market be not well understood , and there be no way to target only destabilise trader . currency crisis be also a result of a series of factor , include lack of economic reform , level of debt , inflation and more not just currency speculation . therefore , a tobin tax could not correct structural problem , nor restore europe s ail economy to health , nor prevent speculative trading trigger by political crisis . 1 
point : most people see financial speculator a an unfortunate part of globalisation ; they make money by bet billion on future market change without any concern for the ordinary people who may be affect by the result economic instability . such speculator can easily afford such a small tax on their deal , and it presence may make them more efficient by force them to check that the position they take be really justify by economic condition . 
counterpoint : ordinary people may lose out if such a tax get in the way of the free working of global currency market . many currency deal be carry out by pension fund on whose profit ordinary people rely for their retirement income , or by company in which people may work or own share who wish to hedge their future liability to safeguard their financial position against shock . a tobin tax be of little use in the bad case speculation which usually hit the poor economy . in the emerge market world of extremely high currency risk , investor who expect a short term devaluation of as little a 3 or 4 would not be deter by a low tobin tax . indeed , give the scale of recent emerge market devaluation 50 in thailand and indonesia , 40 in brazil , the tax would be totally irrelevant . 
point : the tobin tax be an efficient and relatively painless way to raise billion of dollar per year that could easily be use to fund un aid effort . the revenue generate potential of the tax be tremendous . a recent study by the institute for development studies at sussex university have show that a 0 . 0005 global tax on foreign exchange trade alone could raise up to 26bn per year in aid . even if we take the small amount , this would match exist level of official aid . 1 the un and world bank estimate in 1997 that the cost of wipe out the bad form of poverty and provide basic environmental protection would be about 225 billion per year . for comparison , the total annual un budget be about 10 billion . given the current level of poverty in the world and the desperate situation that we have see emerge over and over again in the developing world e . g . the asian tsunami , or kashmiri earthquake , the need for increased fund for aid seem clear . 
counterpoint : while on paper , the tax sound like the ideal solution , world poverty and currency crisis be unlikely to be solve through such a simple idea . although lack of fund be often give a the main problem in address world poverty and humanitarian crisis , much writing on development now agree that the north south gap will not be narrow through a mere transfer of fund . these fund often make the receiving country dependent on outside funding , their economy centre on aid a oppose to industrialization and technological development . furthermore , too much money set aside for development aid be already lose ; kenya s finance ministry , for example , estimate that last november it lose 2bn , a third of it budget , to government corruption . 1 in light of this , we cannot assume that rich country which would collect most of the tax would be willing to allocate all this money to international institution . industrialised country may want to keep it for themselves .
