point : it be inaccurate to perceive marriage merely a an institution for child raising purpose . there be many married couple in society today who do not have child of their own , often by choice , and infertile couple , who cannot conceive child , be still permit to marry . they marry because marriage symbolize a long term commitment to one another , not a pledge to reproduce for the state or humanity a a whole . in any case , gay couple may adopt child in country where they be permit to do so , reveal society's view at large that homosexual couple can readily act a capable parent and provide love home environment . furthermore , the advance of medical science have also enable same sex couple to have child of their own through surrogate mother and sperm donor . it can no longer be say that homosexual couple should not be grant the right to marriage because , either , they cannot have child , or that they cannot raise child adequately . both claim be evidently false . 
counterpoint : marriage be most certainly about raise child and have always be regard a the predominant mean of create a conducive environment in which child can be bring up . as gay couple be unlikely to have child , there be no real necessity for the right to marry to be extend to them . it be true that many heterosexual marriage do not result in offspring , through choice or infertility , however the male female relationship preserve the general rule of marriage : only between those with the potential for procreation1 . 'children have a valid claim to be raise by their own biological parents' , to encourage otherwise be to undermine long held perception about the right way to bring up our youth . 2 
point : to allow gay couple to marry would enable them to take advantage of the various fiscal benefit accord to marry couple in general . as scott bidstrup argue , a gay couple together for 40 year can still be compel by law to testify or provide evidence against one another , something married spouse cannot be force to do 1 . such antiquated law take the discriminatory view that the love between homosexual be artificial and extend it to encompass legal benefit . as justice anthony kennedy note in a supreme court ruling , 'homosexuals be forbidden the safeguard that others enjoy or may seek without constraint'1 . a gay couple's inability to reproduce should not prevent them from obtain the benefit of marriage , benefit grant not to encourage or reward child birth but to recognize the bond between two love one . 
counterpoint : many of the fiscal benefit enjoy by married couple e . g . child support payment be not gear towards encourage marriage in itself , but to promote the existence of the conventional family and procreation . gay couple , unable to propagate society , should not be provide access to the benefit of marriage which be , implicitly , the state's reward for reproductive couple . 'collecting a dead spouse's social security , claim an extra tax exemption for a spouse , and have the right to be cover under a spouse's health insurance policy' be just a few of the benefit a state provide to marry couple 1 . the aforementioned benefit should not be applicable to couple who be unable to provide anything in return . 
point : the state be charge with the responsibility of both provide registrar to conduct marriage ceremony and authenticate marriage certificate . if gay marriage be to be legalize , all registrar could be thereafter force , by the state and their commitment to the law , to legally bind themselves to avoid discriminate between homosexual and heterosexual couple who ask for their service . all registrar who refuse to marry homosexual couple could be fire . there could be no difference in the process or the paperwork require for either a heterosexual or homosexual marriage . the dismissal of discriminate registrant would have a legal precedent in the charge bring upon hotel owner who refuse gay couple and adoption agency who refuse to deal with gay couple . 
counterpoint : states cannot ask registrar to conduct civil marriage between homosexual couple that violate their religious precept . how can a state that espouse multi culturalism and respect for the faith of it citizen thereafter declare it fair and impartial to ask a christian registrar to conduct a homosexual marriage ceremony , and thereafter fire them if they refuse ? that merely replace one discrimination with another . in the united kingdom in 2009 , a christian registrar be demote to a receptionist after refuse to preside over the civil marriage of gay couples1 . ms davies , the demoted registrar , say : britain be suppose to be a nation that respect freedom of conscience 1 . that freedom of conscience be not respect in a state that can fire anyone refuse to marry same sex couple . 
point : gay marriage have clear and tangible positive effect on society where it be permit . there be now ten country that allow gay marriage , with no obvious or noticeable detriment to society at large . as chris ott report from massachusetts , one of few us state to grant gay marriage right , predictably , the sky hasn t fall ensure equality doesn t mean there s less to go around for everyone else 1 . further to that , gay marriage encourage gay adoption , grant a home and a loving environment for an increase number of orphan or unwanted child worldwide . the evidence also suggest that gay parenting be at least as favourable a those in heterosexual family , erode fear that the adopted child will be bad with gay parent 2 . the economist thomas kostigen also argue gay marriage be a boost for the economy , wedding create revenue of all sort even if a marriage doesn t work out that help the economy too . divorces cost money 3 . finally , and most simply , society benefit from the net utility of their citizen , to allow and even encourage gay marriage ensure that those gay citizen wish to celebrate their love be able to do so , in an environment conducive to their mutual happiness . 
counterpoint : gay relationship do not contribute to the interest of the state in propagate society , therefore they should not be grant access to the legal and economic benefit of marriage . furthermore , a david blankenhorn argue , 'for healthy development , what a child need more than anything else be the mother and father who together make the child , who love the child and love each other'1 . in addition , susan shell believe that 'most , if not all , of the goal of the gay marriage movement can be satisfy in the absence of gay marriage'2 . the presence of civil partnership , potentially celebrate with the same festivity that surround wedding , could provide many of the same legal and fiscal benefit that gay couple currently do not have access to . 
point : one of the last bastion of discrimination against gay lie in the fact that gay couple in many country be at present not allow to marry . such discrimination should be eradicate by permit gay couple to marry a a mean of profess their love to each other . the contemporary view of society ought to change with the time ; as recently a 1967 , black and white in some americans could not marry , no one would defend such a law now 1 . gay marriage be possibly , a theodore olson , a former bush administration republican suggest , the last major civil right milestone yet to be surpass 2 . to permit heterosexual couple to profess their love through the bond of marriage , but deny that same right to homosexual couple ultimately devalue their love , a love that be no weak or less valid than that of straight couple . as new york state senator mark grisanti admit when vote in favour of a 2011 bill , i cannot deny a person the same right that i have with my wife 3 . it be clearly discriminatory and reflect an out dated view of homosexuality . 
counterpoint : it be not discriminatory , for marriage be an institution design for the union of men and woman alone . it be intrinsically about the value that govern the transmission of human life to the next generation 1 ; to deny gay couple the right to marry be merely , and obviously , to admit that they have no reproductive capacity . the public recognition that be so vital to the institution of marriage be for the purpose of institutionalize the procreative relationship in order to govern the transmission of human life that result 2 . so long a reproduction require a man and a woman , marriage will necessarily remain the domain of heterosexual couple to protect the reproductive human relationship that foster future generation .
