point : human being require downtime in the form of sleep and rest in order to maintain their peak functioning . long work hour cut into this rest and sleep time and therefore reduce their effectiveness a worker . a cap on the amount of work that people do per week allows for proper rest period . tired worker be prone to make mistake , one of the mistake they can make be to think they can skip necessary sleep with no ill effect . while some people may like to believe that they can train their body to not require a much sleep a they once do this belief be false 1 
counterpoint : while people do indeed need proper rest and downtime in order to perform to their maximum potential , exactly how much rest they need change from individual to individual . a one size fit all approach through legislation will necessarily mean that some people who could work quite comfortably with no ill effect will be prevent from do so . 
point : according to the cia world factbook , non industrialised country have an average of 30 unemployment and industrialised nation have somewhere between 4 12 unemployment1 . underemployment be consider to be even high , though precise figure be by their very nature impossible to acquire . by cap the working hour of those in employment , the unemployed stand an increased chance of enter the workforce . 
counterpoint : if those who be unemployed be the right people to be do those job , they already would be . employers want to maximise their bottom line and will hire the best worker they can find . forcing them to take on low skilled and less able employee reduces competitiveness and cause inefficiency . 
point : one of the most fundamental principle of economics be that of supply and demand . by artificially reduce the supply of hour then demand must increase for other labour , ceteris paribus . 
counterpoint : business will replace worker not with other worker , but with machine , especially in the age of robotics and other automated mass production methodology . businesses will replace the lost manpower not with more manpower , but with machine wherever possible . automation have eliminate some 10 million job , mostly in manufacturing between 1994 and 2004 1 
point : in the universal declaration of human rights in article 23 everyone have the right to work to just and favourable condition of work and article 24 everyone have the right to rest and leisure , include reasonable limitation of work hour and periodic holiday with pay 1 both relate to a fundamental freedom from be force to work too hard . working for too many hour per week can affect health , wellbeing and productivity over the medium to long term . in extremis , a we can see in the karoshi phenomenon in japan , people can work themselves to an early grave . 2 
counterpoint : workers already have protection from over work . they have the ability to say no and they also have the ability to find themselves other , less lengthy employment .
