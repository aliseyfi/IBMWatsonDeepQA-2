point : the main goal of an umpire be to make accurate call . umpires be mean to ensure that a player who be out be call out , for example , and that a foul ball be rule a foul ball . when an umpire make an incorrect call , he be fall short of fulfil his primary responsibility . as the official rule of major league baseball instruct umpire , the first requisite be to get decision correctly . . . . umpire dignity be important but never as important a be right official baseball rules , rule 9 . 05 . 1 
counterpoint : umpires have to balance several important consideration : ensure impartiality and the appearance of impartiality a well ; avoid unnecessary delay in the game ; ensure that all rule be follow ; and to behave in a manner that compels respect from all party . to argue that the umpire s job come down to accurate call be to oversimplify a very complicated role . as the official rule of major league baseball instruct umpire : when you enter a ball park your sole duty be to umpire a ball game a the representative of baseball . . . . keep the game move . a ball game be often help by energetic and earnest work of the umpire official baseball rules , rule 9 . 05 . 1 
point : umpires must make split second judgment , often from bad angle and with many element to watch simultaneously . mistakes will happen . even the official rule acknowledge this when it tell umpire , you no doubt be go to make mistake official baseball rules , rule 9 . 05 . 1 some call will have to be make from a significant distance away from where the umpire be locate a commonly cite justification of mlb s adoption of instant replay on boundary call . 2 fans hold umpire to an exceptionally high standard ; a former umpire nestor chylak put it , they expect an umpire to be perfect on opening day and to improve a the season go on . 3 but it be impossible for a human to attain perfection on his own , so we should provide him with the tool that will enable him to meet the exacting standard set out for him . 
counterpoint : everybody know umpire make mistake ; it happen often enough that fan and player all recognize it be part of the game . nobody expect umpire to be perfect , but everyone want umpire to strive for perfection . it s just like with player : everybody want their favourite player to strive to play perfectly , but nobody actually expect them to be perfect . thus , we can t sacrifice other element of the game discuss elsewhere in this debate on the altar of perfection . 
point : instant replay will lead fan , manager , and player to hold umpire in high regard . this will occur in two way . 
counterpoint : both the argument provide by the proposition be faulty . 
point : umpires be suppose to facilitate a smooth game . when they be the center of attention , it be usually because something have go wrong . legendary hall of fame umpire bill klem accurately state , the best umpired game be the game in which the fan cannot recall the umpire who work it . 1 the game be suppose to be decide by the feat of the player on the field , not the fallibility of the men in blue . instant replay will help make this happen . 
counterpoint : baseball be not just about the player . it s about manager , coach , fan , and umpire too . it be a rather narrow view to argue that baseball umpire should remain invisible . umpires play a central role in every game . they make signal that be mean to attract attention . when a crucial play occur in the bottom of the ninth inning , all eye be on the umpire to see what the outcome will be . bruce froemming , who break klem s record for most mlb game umpired , have this rejoinder to klem : one of the really wrong theory about officiating be that a good official be one you never notice . the umpire who make that statement be probably a real poor official who try to get his paycheck and hide behind his partner and stay out of trouble all his life . control of the ballgame be the difference between umpire that show up for the player and the manager . 1 rather than deny umpires central role , we should acknowledge it . 
point : there be time when umpire make incorrect call that determine the outcome of game or , bad , world series championships e . g . , don denkinger and the 1985 world series , mention above . these erroneous decision lead to the team that deserve to win actually lose , and vice versa . in short , the result of the game be illegitimate . this be especially unfortunate when fan invest hour to watch a game or hundred of hour watch an entire season , only to see the wrong outcome which could have be entirely avoidable if umpire be allow to review their decision . 
counterpoint : this debate be clearly highlight a difference in philosophy about the role of the umpire . proposition first say that umpire should not be a central part of the game see argument four . now proposition say that a game s outcome be illegitimate if it be decide by a poor call by an umpire . this be the wrong way of look at it . as long a the umpire try his best to make an accurate judgment , then his call be legitimate , a be anything that flow from it . legitimacy be not the same a accuracy . indeed , the umpire s call might be the sole source of legitimacy . proposition previously quote legendary umpire bill klem , but remember two of klem s other statement : gentlemen , he be out because i say he be out , and it ain t nothin till i call it . 1 there be no such thing a a legitimate outcome divorce from the context of an umpire s call .
