point : there be a perfectly reasonable case that the state should pay . the wealth now enjoy by the usa , for example , stem in part from the use of slave . its development wouldn't have be a fast , it gdp would not be so high , it would not have so much money if it weren't for slave . some of it should be pay back . if link can be establish to corporation , then those corporation should pay . pointing to the fact that individual alive today didn't keep slave be simplistic they have benefit from living in an enviromnent whose wealth be build on the back of slave . 
counterpoint : firstly , simply because current individual be benefit from the previous harm doesn t mean that they be responsible for them , they be just feel it aftermath . there be no link between the two they do not commit these atrocity , even if it have help the nation they live in . secondly , the proposition point out that identified corporation ought pay , but many individual and corporation benefit from slave ownership , and the wealth it generate have trickle down into investment , bank account and business fund today . but why should the state or corporation pay , when the primary benefit be to individual ? 
point : this money would be more symbolic and that symbolism could be the mean for begin the restoration of the fortune of a minority that have be long oppress . this isn t about victimhood or single out a particular minority for special charitable treatment this be money owe , and money people be entitle to . it be not the causing of a division , but rather the healing of a still open wound . that suppose symbol of freedom and liberty , the us capitol building be construct by slave . 1 african americans cannot truly feel part of the free society and democracy in which they live until this wrong be publicly admit and right . 
counterpoint : it be divisive to push an agenda that suggest that african americans be still so different that they can and should be single out . why encourage those that weren't bear at the time of slavery to see themselves a victim in a society that actually offer them huge opportunity ? we should be look beyond race . we should forgive and forget . this discussion drag u back to old problem , open old wound , and make racial division and tension more likely . 
point : slaves be entitle to compensation and , be decease , that money should go to their descendant . this principle doesn't cease to be true over time truth and justice don t have sell by date . the most important thing to establish be the principle of reparation be right . the how be less important . a reasonable approach would be to say that individual would have to establish a direct link between themselves and a slave many can . the fact that do so will be difficult do not mean that it should not happen . dwelling on the practical difficulty be no real opposition . practicalities come second : the focus should be on right this wrong . 
counterpoint : simply because one's ancestor be entitle to payment do not mean their descendant be due that money , similar to how if one's ancestor commit a crime one be not hold accountable . no wrong have be take against the descendant of the slave , only the slave themselves .
