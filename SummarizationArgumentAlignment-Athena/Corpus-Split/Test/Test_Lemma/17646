point : denying rogue state weapon be the most effective way of prevent them from pose a threat to other state or their own people . the un , rather than individual member state , should regulate the arm trade and , in particular , restrict arm sale to rogue state . all major arm export country claim they already regulate arm export tightly typically by a system of licensing in order to ensure that arm do not end up in undesirable hand . however , the united states , for example , be one of the principal supplier of arm to indonesia under suharto , provide training aircraft , radar equipment , spare part and machine gun . in contrast , the un can set up an international convention or treaty in order to prevent country sell arm to rogue state . as have be demonstrate by the kyoto protocol , the un can enforce a change in a national government's behaviour even if it have not sign up to the treaty itself . this would be an effective way to police arm trade , a the un security council would act a the authorize body . in this way , unlike national government , the un would provide the correct check and balance to regulate the arm trade in an impartial and legal way . a practical solution be forthcoming ; the arms trade treaty , initially put forward in 2003 by a group of nobel peace laureate , have be vote in favour by 153 member state and be currently be negotiate . 1 since the inauguration of barack obama , the new american administration be also now in favour of the treaty . 
counterpoint : it be extremely unfortunate when a state to which arm have be sell later become rogue and misuse those arm , but the proposition's proposal will do nothing to prevent it . the un be unable to place block on the export of small arm and , even if it do , such small scale policy will do nothing to stop war . the small , cheap weapon that the proposition talk about be usually make and sell illegally . attempts by national government be currently afoot to stamp out that trade . an additional order from the un would hardly make any difference . furthermore , when un member state vote for the arms trade treaty , the george bush administration vote against the proposal . as the us trade more arm than any other country , the treaty be worthless without american backing . although the obama government have express agreement with the treaty's aim , the national rifle association and the american people be still sceptical , a they view un intervention a an attempt to circumvent the second amendment in order to impose domestic gun regulation . 
point : the arm trade be a global problem which , by definition , cross national border and continental boundary . to soften it impact will require more than just the piecemeal action of isolated government . broad international co operation be necessary and a such the un be the ideal forum to pursue an end to arm sale to rogue nation . because of it global membership the un be the only forum which can bring together the required global coalition . furthermore , national government be notoriously bad at obey their own rule on the arm trade . in order to secure lucrative contract , national government regularly bend their rule to permit the export of arm to rogue state . russia and the ukraine , for example , be supply weapon include anti tank missile to iraq right up until the second gulf war . 1 since national government be unlikely to make end the arm trade to rogue nation a long term priority , un regulation be require . unlike any national government , the un be able to take the long view and end this appalling trade . practically , the un security council currently have the power to impose an arm embargo 
counterpoint : the proposition's view that the un be a truly global forum capable of marshal enough support to restrict arm sale to rogue state be at odds with reality . given that member state set the agenda for the un , the commitment to control the arm trade must ultimately come from within member state themselves . it cannot be successfully impose from above precisely because , a the proposition point out , national government do have a vested interest in maintain regulatory control over the arm trade . this matter since it be the member state that will have to enforce any restriction . the un itself have no mechanism for ensure that it rule be enforce . furthermore , be the un to try to restrict the arm trade and fail , this failure would damage the un by discredit it far . at a time when the un be attack for be incompetent follow it failure over the iraq war , the oil for food programme and the asian tsunami relief operation1 it would be foolhardy for it to undertake a project that be doom to failure . in practice , the un's ability to impose arm embargo have be use inconsistently . recently , for example , the un maintain that it be both legal , under un security council resolution 1973 , and illegal , under un security council resolution 1970 , to supply arm to libyan rebel in the arab spring . 2 
point : the arm trade be one of the principal source of poverty in the world , a state spend limited resource pay for arm rather than improve the welfare of their people . this problem be particularly severe with rogue state , which typically have more enemy both inside and outside their border and place less of a priority on welfare . in fact , the developing world spend about 20 billion a year on arm . 1 and of course the cost of conflict be much high . given that a fundamental part of the un's mission be to improve the life of ordinary people , it be right that it should make end the arm trade to rogue state a priority . 
counterpoint : campaigners may want to believe that the arm trade be a major cause of poverty in rogue state , but the reality be that arm sale to rogue state be highly limit at the moment , and the amount of money involve be small on the scale of a government's budget . the major cause of poverty be bad government and debt . the 20 billion spend on arm each year by develop country may seem a considerable sum but apart from the fact that only a fraction of this be spend by rogue state it be dwarf in comparison to the size of debt owe by develop country : 550 billion . 1 claiming that the arm trade cause poverty merely diverts attention from the real problem . 
point : rogue state , by definition , refuse to be bind by international norm and threaten the stability of their region or even the world a a whole . by and large , rogue state be less developed country lack the capability to produce sophisticated weapon or even basic arm in large number . trade with more developed nation be therefore their only route to acquire a significant military capacity . the trade in small arm , in particular , be generally regard a be a root cause of many of the conflict in africa , which have bring death and poverty to million . given that an ak47 can be buy for as little a 6 in some country , it be no surprise that the civil war in sudan last 21 year and cost almost 2 million life . 1 furthermore , a rogue nation may use arm against it own population . typically rogue state have poor human right record and be willing to commit atrocity against their own citizen . supplying them with arm give rogue state the tool to do the job . saddam hussein , for example , use soviet and western make arm in his slaughter of the kurds in 1991 . 2 similarly , us m16 machine gun be use to slaughter peaceful demonstrator in east timor in 1991 . 3 in light of this , it be vital that the un take a lead in stamp out arm sale to rogue nation 
counterpoint : many of the weapon which rogue state have use to threaten their neighbour or oppress their own people be sell to them before they be regard a rogue state . for example , the weapon which iraq use to invade kuwait and which be subsequently use against allied force and the kurds be sell to iraq before saddam hussein be consider a threat to international peace and security . looking back , that judgement be very wrong but it demonstrate that the proposition's proposal would have do nothing to prevent saddam get hold of arm . the fact be that very few arm be sell to rogue state at the moment . the federation of american scientists claim that eight state to which the us currently supply arm be trouble : brazil , columbia , india , indonesia , israel , pakistan , philippines , turkey . 1 none of those state be widely regard a rogue . furthermore , war be not cause by the existence of cheap arm . the african war that the proposition refers to be usually a result of ethnic division . even if the availability of sophisticated weapon be reduce , the war would still be fight , and just a brutally , with whatever arm be available .
