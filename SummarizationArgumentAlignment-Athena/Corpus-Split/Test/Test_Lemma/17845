point : more education provide the opportunity to acquire more skill and therefore more option . it have be show many time that those with more education find it easy to find work and that they be more likely to find that work satisfying . similarly , the level of education among the population can have a positive effect on the economy a a whole a they can be more efficient worker . the impact of extra year of education on earnings and economic productivity be also disproportionately heavy at the low end that be , two more year at school for a 16 year old will make a much great percentage difference to their late economic worth than two year of graduate work for a 22 year old . the uk have recently raise the school leave age to 18 for the same reason . 1 
counterpoint : this argument suggest that child whom britain's state school have fail to teach even to read and write should be compel to stay at those school for an extra two year . it will not suddenly bring new opportunity just because child be force to sit in a classroom for long . 
point : doing so increase the economic potential of the future workforce , and so will bring increased tax revenue in the long term to more than cover any initial cost . although some country would experience a more dramatic change than others , it be worth note that in many state a very large majority of young people voluntarily stay in education beyond the end of compulsory school e . g . france , germany and japan . in the uk 84 per cent of pupil in year 10 state that they have intention to stay on in further education . 1 if these country can already bear the extra cost without economic collapse , it should be possible for others to cope as well . 
counterpoint : the cost of extend the period of compulsory education be just too high . in many country the number of student in the last two year of formal schooling would at least double , require a huge investment in teacher , book , new school building , computer , etc . and this be just the direct cost there be also potentially enormous indirect loss to the state in term of the tax and pension contribution which it currently receive from young worker but would forego if the school leave age be raise . 
point : ensuring everyone get educate for the same amount of time at school should promote equality . currently early school leaving be link with other indicator of socio economic disadvantage , such a low income job or high unemployment . more importantly parent who leave school young and a a consequence have low grade occupation be more likely to have child who leave school early only 60 of those child stay in education past 16 1 . forcing all child to stay in school longer could break this cycle of disadvantage . 2 
counterpoint : unfortunately equality in the job market be unlikely to emerge simply because everyone now stay in school for the same amount of time . as note above , not everyone will get the same out of school for be there the same time . those who achieve the best exam result will still be the most employable , especially if they go into tertiary education before find a job .
