point : even if all subject must show practical economic utility , the study of classics be still justifiable . translation of latin and ancient greek teach concentration , attention to detail and logical thought . debates about the interpretation of classical literature develop the ability to think critically and to construct reasoned argument . familiarity with classical literature improve the ability to write clearly , concisely and eloquently . these be all skill value by employer ; people who have study classics have reach the top of politics , commerce , diplomacy and law . 1 
counterpoint : all these skill can be learn through the study of other subject , include one s own language and other foreign language . these subject also have practical utility in themselves , unlike latin and ancient greek . the prominence of people who have study classics in position of power be a result of their social background or inherent intellectual ability , not a classical education . most people who have study classics attend either private school imply that they come from a privileged background or school intend for the academically gift . 
point : classics be useful for understand the etymology the study of the origin and development of word of english word . italian , french , spanish , portuguese and romanian the romance language be derive from latin : knowledge of latin vocabulary greatly ease the learning of these language . 1 much modern language teaching emphasise conversational skill rather than grammatical rule ; classical language teaching be usually base upon grammar , rather than conversation . 2 pupils therefore develop a clear understanding of how languages work by study classical language ; this can be apply to the study of both their own language and modern foreign language . 
counterpoint : the study of etymology be of purely academic interest . it be more efficient to learn what word mean than to spend time learn a whole new language in order to be able to work out what word be likely to mean . it be also more efficient to learn modern foreign language directly , rather than to learn latin and or ancient greek first . once one have learn one foreign language , it be comparatively easy to learn another , since one have develop the technique for learn vocabulary and grammatical structure . the similarity between the romance language mean that one can just a easily use knowledge of italian to learn spanish a one can use knowledge of latin to learn either of these language . pupils should learn grammar when study both their own language and modern foreign language . it be absurd to suggest that they need to learn a dead language in order to do so . 
point : learning classical language give pleasure to many who study them , since they be satisfy intellectual challenge . a substantial proportion of those who be give the opportunity to study latin and or ancient greek at school continue this study at university . societies should not be obsess with balance sheet and vocational skill , but should seek to provide cultural enrichment to their citizen . it be wrong that the opportunity for such cultural enrichment through classical language if often only available to those whose parent can afford private education . 
counterpoint : while many people may gain intellectual pleasure from study the classic , many others may find it difficult and unpleasant . it seem unfair then , that such a subject should be study in school where it will most likely be examine upon , add extra stress to student . people be able to research and study classic in their own time and it should not be impose upon them in school . 
point : the influence of classical text upon subsequent writing and think make knowledge of latin and ancient greek necessary for many area of intellectual enquiry . european literature bristle with classical allusion : the work of dante , shakespeare , milton , goethe and countless others cannot be fully appreciate without close familiarity with the canon of classical writing . 1 since latin be the language of academic discussion until the eighteenth century , it be of great importance for the study of history and theology . the teaching of classical language at school enables people to pursue study in these area in late life . 
counterpoint : the small number of people who undertake advanced literary or historical work can learn classical language at university or in late life if they be necessary for their study . it be unnecessary for the vast majority of the population to read dead language .
