point : a strong , effective and impartial united nations standing army would deny powerful military state the right to bully and blackmail rival into submission with the threat of military force . a un army would be able to balance that threat with their own willingness to come to the aid of state under military duress . the united states , unwilling to risk a protracted conflict against a respect , well train multi national force would have to fall back . to use an example , american military intervention in vietnam , against the wish of the majority of the population , could have be prevent have a u . n . stand army exist to respond to the wish of the vietnamese people and stand against the united states intervention . the existence of such a military rival would therefore force the united states to increase it investment in it state department and diplomatic solution to political crisis . ultimately , peace would be more effectively maintain . 
counterpoint : a un standing army would not solve 'the problem of american military hegemony' , even if there be such a problem . it be perhaps unlikely that the us would fund such an army . nor would other major military spender like the united kingdom be likely to since they already send troop to nato , possibly in the near future to an eu army , and have it own army it would be significantly overstretch . this united nations could not raise sufficient fund to create such a force . to establish military parity with the us would require a large nuclear arsenal and an enormous military infrastructure . states will not ever finance such a force at the expense of build up their own force . the army would have to be willing to be pitch against the interest of the us or other permanent member of the security council , yet any u . n . stand army would require the blessing of that security council , where those member have a veto . therefore make this not possible , a only the unsc can be responsible for security . american military hegemony will not be challenge by a force that be under it own direction . 
point : changes in modern warfare dictate the need for an impartial , rapidly deploy , multi national force . modern warfare be no longer the trench battle of battalion align to a flag , it be increasingly police action design to prevent the resort to warfare in the first place or enforce ceasefires once they have begin . as such , the impartiality of a un standing army would be highly valuable , offer both party in the conflict a neutral peacemaker and peacekeeper . contrast this to the perceived difference in attitude between troop from britain , the us , russia and france to war side in the balkans . it would be free of accusation of meddling and self interest that accompany the participation of troop from neighbour state in un intervention for example , nigeria in west african mission . a un standing army could overcome local civilian suspicion , free from the threat of propaganda from those oppose to it and free from the restraint of state power on those troop involve . 
counterpoint : impartiality be not define by the constitution of the force , but the decision making process which determine their use . a un standing army would not alter the injustice of the un security council and it veto system , which institutionalize self interest in the decision of the body . as the recent proposal for an independent un force indicate , the force could move swiftly to avert catastrophe but only specifically after un authorization 1 . therefore whilst a un standing army would ostensibly be neutral , the us for which it would be deploy would still have the same , underlie self interested motif on the part of the un security council . the problem be therefore not resolve , but push far up the line . 
point : a un standing army would be more effective than the variety of troop staff mission under the current system . at present most un operation be supply by develop nation who hope to make a profit from the payment they receive for their service , but who be under equipped and badly train . forces from the major power be provide sparingly and only after substantial public pressure or when there exist an incentive for their use . a un standing army would be well prepare , both in regard to training and equipment , and it soldier would have great motivation a they would have make a choice to enlist , rather than be conscript force by their own state to fight someone else s war . a single un force would also have good command and control than in current situation , when different national force and their commander often fail to work effectively together in the field for cultural and linguistic reason . successful force such a the french foreign legion , the indian army and the roman army show that issue of language and culture need not be problem in combat situation . they can be overcome through a strong professional ethos and a commitment to a mutual cause , value that can only be expect to develop if troop prepare , train and fight together . 
counterpoint : a un standing army would still have the same drawback a the current model . differences in language , culture , etc . will seriously mar operational effectiveness , especially in combat situation , irrespective of whether they have be train together . in the heat of the battle , troop that have grow up in different culture , speak different language will understandably fall back upon what they know . cultural instinct cannot be retaught or unlearn in a military barrack ; they will prove an obstacle to operational effectiveness . in addition , in a truly multinational force there will always be a great many individual soldier who could be suspect of take side in a particular conflict e . g . muslims or orthodox christians in the balkan conflict ; be such soldier to be pull out from a particular mission , thereby perhaps weaken the whole force ? a un army might also end up be very poorly equip , for if the advanced military power start to see the un a a potential rival or adversary , they will refuse to provide it with quality arm and armour . in that case , the un stand army become both another rival in the global balance of power and may drive opposition to the institution itself and it long fight to garner respect .
