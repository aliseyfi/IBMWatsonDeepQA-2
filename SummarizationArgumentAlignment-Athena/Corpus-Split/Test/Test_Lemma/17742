point : states cannot expect to be hold responsible for the action of their fellow state where suspect be render to . the c . i . a . have a policy in practice where it obtain diplomatic assurance that torture will not be use . under customary international law , the u . s . a . be oblige to act in good faith . so , when america be give diplomatic assurance by another government , it would be a diplomatic blunder and ill advise not to trust that guarantee . also , imagine the consequence if it be one day prove that the c . i . a . render a person , know they would be torture : not only would the person involve lose their job , but also the reputation of the c . i . a . would be severely damage . that s why the c . i . a . have an incentive to make sure that these assurance be believable and do their due diligence . if thereafter torture occur , the state responsible for render the suspect be understandably innocent of any blame . 
counterpoint : states must do more than simply garner diplomatic assurance , a promise that be not worth the paper be write on . how , for example , do the u . s . government know the difference between the harsh interrogation method and torture of the state accept the suspect , and on what ground do it base it belief that it be more likely than not that torture win t take place ? the work of the c . i . a . , by it nature , be secretive . so , even if the c . i . a . do research and obtain agreement , the general public can never check whether these agreement hold any water . since the c . i . a . be be hold responsible to fight terrorism , they might even have an incentive to bend the rule a bit as long a they can later show result to the public . 
point : extraordinary rendition save life . it be use to bring people who be know or believe to be terrorist , to justice . these suspect be often stateless or hide in place where ordinary process of law do not work extraordinary rendition be then the only possible way of track them down , get the necessary information from them , and bring them to justice . they carry information which could save thousand of life the u . s . a . would be foolish not to try and get that out of them . an example of this be ramzi youssef , who mastermind the 1993 bombing of the world trade center and plot to blow up airline over the pacific ocean . after a rendition to the u . s . a . , he be convict and now serve a life sentence . 1 without rendition , who know how many people he would have kill or how long he would have escape the justice that he deserve . 
counterpoint : extraordinary rendition harm civilians more than it protect them . for every example of an effective rendition , one have to ask : be it worth it ? because for every terrorist successfully catch and convict after rendition , there may be many more mistake . on top of that consider the loss of reputation that the practice of extraordinary rendition have cause the u . s . a . to suffer amongst it chief ally . in 2007 the e . u . adopt a report condemn this particular u . s . policy , and this be follow by a massive public outcry . 1 such american tactic simply play into the hand of terrorist who seek to stir hatred against america and divide it from it ally . and finally : do the pretext of a terrorist threat really justify take away a person s basic human right to due process ? especially a many expert believe that torture be an ineffective method of acquire reliable intelligence in any case . 
point : certain state have make reservation to the general treaty which permit rendition under specific circumstance . for example , when ratify the convention against torture cat in 1994 , the u . s . a . make the reservation that it can render person to country when they believe that it be more likely than not that a person win t be torture so , under the u . s . interpretation of cat , the u . s . a . can render person to country that practice torture , as long a the u . s . a have reason to believe that it will not torture in this specific case . 1 this be a reasonable , and legal , mean to circumvent the convention . 
counterpoint : extraordinary rendition be never acceptable . the geneva conventions of 1949 state that individual or mass forcible transfer , as well a deportation of protected person from occupied territory to the territory of the occupy power or to that of any other country , be prohibit , regardless of their motive . 1 there be no room in international humanitarian law , which cover arm conflict , for the forced transfer of protected person . furthermore , whilst the us relies on the deniability of it rendition program , the fact that the most common destination include egypt , syria and jordan ensure that such claim can be dismiss a mere obfuscation . 2 
point : extraordinary rendition permit the transferring of suspected enemy combatant from one place to another without the bureaucratic and legal difficulty of establish their legal position . contemporary warfare , most notably suspected terrorist in the war on terror , be not cover by the dictate of international humanitarian law , require extraordinary rendition to move the suspect from battlefield to place of interrogation and then back to their country of residence . as condoleezza rice argue in some situation a terrorist suspect can be extradite accord to traditional judicial procedure . but there have long be many other case where , for some reason , the local government cannot detain or prosecute a suspect , and traditional extradition be not a good option . 1 without extraordinary rendition , the process or extradition would take much long and suspect case would remain tied up in military tribunal or civilian court for indefinite amount of time , sometimes rendition be the only practical option . 
counterpoint : the legal ambiguity of enemy combatant be a problem , but it be not one solve by the circumvention of international law . states must either grant current geneva convention dictate to enemy combatant , and disregard the awkward fit , or advocate for the evolution of international law to ensure combatant be grant their requisite right . the circumvention enshrine in the practise of extraordinary rendition serve merely to convey that ignore international law be acceptable , inadvertently justify the illegal action of enemy combatant who also flagrantly violate geneva convention protocol . to provide such a propaganda tool for enemy combatant be most certainly not necessary in contemporary warfare ; it will only strengthen it barbarity and the ignorance of restraint build up to limit warfare .
