point : it be unconstitutional to require individual to buy private insurance , and penalize them for not do so that be , penalize their non act , their omission to purchase insurance . as david b . rivkin jr . and lee a . casey argue : can congress require every american to buy health insurance ? in short , no . the constitution assign only limited , enumerated power to congress and none , include the power to regulate interstate commerce or to impose tax , would support a federal mandate require anyone who be otherwise without health insurance to buy it . 1 
counterpoint : the federal government mandate positive activity all the time , and this be why several court have also uphold the constitutionality of the individual mandate . 7 
point : many attorney general have fight constitutionality of mandate . since the passage of the legislation in march of 2010 , many state government , governor , and attorney general have press forward with lawsuit centre on the idea that the individual mandate in the legislation be unconstitutional . 7 underlying these legal challenge be a debate about the basis of the national congress s lawmaking power . in order for law pass by congress to be consider legitimate and enforceable , those law must be base on a power confer on congress by the constitution . on those area of law and public life where the constitution be silent , legislative power rest not in the hand of congress , but rather be reserve to the states respectively , or to the people . 9 
counterpoint : a refusal to purchase healthcare insurance can have an effect on interstate commerce , because in shrink the risk pool of insured the premium would incrementally rise . in 2007 , healthcare expenditure amount to 2 . 2 trillion , or 7 , 421 a person , and account for 16 . 2 of the gross domestic product . these statistic leave no doubt that regulate health insurance be synonymous with regulate interstate commerce . 10 
point : the vertical separation of power , under which the federal government posse limit and enumerate power , while the states wield general power include the right to operate their own police force , be a key part of america's constitutional architecture . far from be an 18th century affectation , these structural limitation on government power be design to protect individual liberty . in the framers' view , limit the ability of the federal government to exercise authority be core to ensure that no single government entity would grow too powerful . this be because , under the supremacy clause , any constitutionally compliant federal legislation trump exercise of individual state s power . therefore , an infinitely capacious commerce clause which would be produce if the mandating of healthcare be to be allow would rob states of any remain authority . 8 
counterpoint : the healthcare insurance can be unprecedented but still be constitutional a erwin chemerinsky argue : anything that have never be do before be literally unprecedented , which mean it lack any precedent . so the question be , will the supreme court want to authorize this new extension of congressional power in light of the fact that it violate the first principle it affirm in lopez and morrison ? or , to the contrary , will it want to take the opportunity reaffirm that these principle still apply , notwithstanding raich , in a case with no further implication beyond the statute in question ? 10
