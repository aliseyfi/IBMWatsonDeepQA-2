point : the usa be by far the world s big economy and it should do more to pay it share of the global fund s fund need . 
counterpoint : the global fund be an obligation that the whole world should be meet , not just the united states . in august 2011 the economist issue a report explain that the real gdp in most rich economy be still below it level at the end of 2007 . in contrast , emerge economy india , china , brazil output have jump by almost 20 over the same period . the rich world s woe have clearly hasten the shift in global economic power towards the emerge market . actually the emerge economy account for 46 of world retail sale , 52 of all purchase of motor vehicle and 82 of mobile phone subscription . almost a quarter of the fortune global 500 firm come from emerge market ; in 1995 it be only 4 . 1 as the economic power shift to country other than the us it be also logical that other country should increase their funding for such foreign aid program far more . china , brazil , india be the one that have the resource to increase funding due to the economic growth . the us be , give their current economic status , do more than enough to help support the global fund . why should america , have be in economic decline , contribute more than the emerge country ? the pressure of give more should be put on those country rather than the us . 
point : america be see by many people over the world a an influential country that pave the way in international policy . an increase in funding will also have therefore a major effect on other donor country . with the increased funding of the usa , there will also be a great demand to invest more from other country . 
counterpoint : why should other country be incentivized in the future to give more if the usa , the big contributor , be go to be do more ? this will simply encourage other country to think that the us will contribute the necessary funding . the us have already do enough to be a good role model for other country when it come to support the global fund . an increase in support therefore will not have the wish for effect and should not be implement . 
point : the us should show through spending on aid , the value it want to promote in it humanitarian project . therefore well manage and effective project should get more funding , and give more funding to the global fund be the first step in this re education of ngos . this will serve other project a a pointer what they have to do in order to receive more support and also set an example how project must work in order to get increased funding . 
counterpoint : first of all it be immoral to tie fund that could decide on the life or death of a person to some policy restriction a government seem to believe in . it be also wrong to assume that if an effective initiative have a high number of employee that they should not be eligible for increased funding . countries fund the global fund should do so by weigh up the benefit increase fund would bring , rather than how the organization be structure .
