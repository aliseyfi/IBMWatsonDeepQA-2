point : up to 2009 , the percentage of student in england study literature to general certificate of secondary education gcse level have be decline year on year1 . in 2010 there be an introduction of a combined language and literature course , although the focus remain more on the teaching of english a a communication skill rather than a cultural art form to be study in it own right . this demonstrate the well know idea that league table and pass exam be more important in the education system than the education itself , neglect the fact that the study of literature require and improve the basic literacy skill which be at the heart of governmental policy . in 2008 , 37 of the poor child do not take a literature exam , lead to the belief that the study of literature for an elite , deprive those who be perhaps most in need of the inspiration and apply study that read literature provide . this conflict between the time and effort it take to study the classic and the demand for assessment have be around for some time , and despite the repeated call for change from previous poet laureates andrew motion and michael morpurgo2 it seem that the education sector do not recognise how beneficial the study of these work be to child . 1 : information on the decline of the study of literature take from the conversation between dr . bethan marshall and school minister diana johnson on bbc radio 4 on 17 december 2009 access 05 06 11 9 2 : information on the decline of the study of literature take from the conversation between dr . bethan marshall and school minister diana johnson on bbc radio 4 on 17 december 2009 access 05 06 11 9 
counterpoint : the reason why basic literacy be at the heart of the governmental concern be that it still isn't be teach to a high enough standard . before be able to enjoy and properly understand the english literary classic a core understanding of how the language work be require . the problem be exemplify by the need to have mark available in all discipline for the quality of english use in term of spelling , punctuation and grammar and by the fact that business director such a tesco director lucy neville rolfe still complain of poor standard from school leavers1 . recent finding by the national literary trust show that an alarm number 3 to for out of 10 child between the age of 11 and 13 own no book at all2 . this surely suggest that there be a deeper problem within the education system that mean that when child reach their gcse's they simply be not prepared to tackle the complexity of the classic . 1 : article 'should spell and grammar count in exam ?

point : despite the obvious positive of teach a variety of work in literature course , the time constraint and pressure of constant examination mean that this be often impossible . as the director of the national association for the teaching of english ian mcneilly say : for a teacher under pressure to deliver result there may be precious little time or inclination to study area which be not for assessment 1 , so in this respect it be essential to ensure a focus on they core classic which be a we have establish , regard a be the best and most engaging way into the study of english . by focus on the building block of english literary thinking , the door be leave open for individual both on their own and with the guidance of teacher to read beyond the classic and build their own interest from these accept foundation . 1 : calls for change from poet laureate take from bbc news article 'literary great key to english' , 30 september 2005 access 06 06 11 11 
counterpoint : by expose child to a prescribed list of canonical work it would surely lessen the amount and diversity of thing young people read . the logic of read great work of the past leading to the desire to read other work perhaps equally great operate both way . why not allow for a number of variation accord to choice by the student if they be allow to study and be examine on thing they freely choose and enjoy , then surely it will have the same positive effect on their attitude towards literature . the fact that school be so constrain by infrastructure impose from above should also point to a more balanced system in which a broad range of topic can be explore , give that for the majority of people , gcse level will be the furthest they take the study of literature in any form . 
point : we refer to certain work a 'literary classics' because of the recognition they have receive from the academic world . this be a process which take time , but more than ever before there be a widespread awareness and general consensus on what be mean by the term 'classic' in this context . they be choose because of their individual merit and influence on culture the most commonly cite single writer be william shakespeare . he be one of , if not the great writer in the english language , so the study of his work be surely essential to anyone learn english for themselves . it be often overstated how much of our current vocabulary we owe to shakespeare , however the point remain valid that he form much of the basis for the language we speak and write today1 . to not study the his writing , along with that of the other great innovator chaucer , milton and dickens to name but a few , would deprive people of an understanding and awareness of their own culture , and also inhibit the integration of others into the english language and way of life . this issue be also not limit to the uk , a an article in the boston globe suggest that more than half of americans age 18 to 24 never read book for pleasure2 . it be almost certainly the case that the compulsory study of certain work would change that figure . 1 : list of shakespearean word : amanda mabillard 'words shakespeare invented shakespeare online' . 20 aug . 2000 access 06 06 11 12 2 : article on the decline of reading : david mehegan , 'young people read a lot less' , november 19 , 2007 access 06 06 11 13 
counterpoint : although the influence of the literary classic be undeniable , their significance be indeed often overstate . language by it very nature be constantly change and evolve both in a biological and cultural sense , and despite the fact that we may still use word invent by shakespeare today , that do not mean that they necessarily carry the same meaning a they do in the context of his work . as such the teaching of say work be not actually essential to the understanding of the word , or of how to use it in modern contemporary society . in other english speak country like america , the classic do not have the same cultural significance or dialectic relevance to their society . whilst the artistic merit of work such a shakespeare may still be appreciate in such place , it do not seem right to impose them on people who would otherwise choose not to study them . the decision of worth by the academic world do not make any work by definition interesting , and although it would be undesirable to lose the cultural heritage , the choice of what to study would probably lead to great interest in the subject , and by extension a great genuine interest in the influence of these work .
