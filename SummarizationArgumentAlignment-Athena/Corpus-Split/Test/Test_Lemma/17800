point : elections only come around every four year or so , allow unethical or incompetent politician to do a lot of damage in office before face the judgment of their constituent . and after three year or so , many voter may have forget about their offending behavior , allow them to get away with it . in any case , regular election seldom focus on the record of one particular candidate for a legislature , but be a referendum on their party a a whole . if their party remain popular , or if their seat be a safe one , then incompetent and unethical politician will often be re elected regardless of their personal failing . such be the case in california , where immediately before the recall , gray davis a democrat be re elect simply because the local republican party have self destruct . 1 
counterpoint : in reality , most recall vote in system where they be allow come down to judgment about policy decision . in 2003 no one accuse gray davis of be personally corrupt or mentally incapable of wield power . davis be eject a governor of california because voter didn t like the way he have handle power utility and try to solve the state s debt problem . not only should davis have be allow to serve out his term so that voter could judge him on the long term success of his policy in these area ; the struggle of his successor a governor , arnold schwarzenegger , with much the same set of problem suggest that get rid of davis do little to address the underlying problem face california . 
point : people today be apathetic and distrustful about politics , which be very unhealthy for a democracy . low turnout in election mean that government today lack moral authority . giving people more direct control would create more interest in politics , and get more people educate and active about the issue that affect them . in other word , allow recall election will help to restore faith in politics and encourage active citizenship . enabling ordinary voter to sack unsatisfactory representative will give them an incentive to monitor what their politician be do in office , and will encourage the medium to cover legislative affair more fully than they do at present . 1 
counterpoint : if people be uninterested or uninformed about politics , then it be not clear that give them more control over it be a good idea . giving such people more control over politics may be detrimental . moreover , people who cannot be bother to vote or take interest in politics once every four year be not very likely to be bother to vote in recall election a well . 
point : having a recall mechanism focus the mind of elected representative and ensures that they keep the interest of their constituent constantly in mind . not only will this lead to harder work politician with high ethical standard , it will also prevent them sell out to lobby group and party whip . all too often elected representative give way to the lure of business a usual in the capital city , and forget the folk who send them there in the first place . a system which provide the opportunity for a recall will give voter more power than what they currently have cast a ballot once every four or five year . for the reason outline above , i . e . that voter may simply lack quality of choice in election time , give them the ability to demand a recall decrease the democratic deficit 1 . 
counterpoint : the overwhelming number of elected representative at every level already keep the concern of their constituent constantly in mind , work very long hour in their interest . recall system be offensive a they imply that all politician be crook who need some kind of parole procedure . in addition , too much focus on very local interest can make politics very parochial and lead to too little consideration of the overall national interest , allow small minority to block necessary reform and encourage wasteful pork barrel spending . finally , recall election be not the only mean to hold politician to high standard of behavior ; if they stray ethically they can already be punish by the court , by impeachment , or by legislative ethic panel .
