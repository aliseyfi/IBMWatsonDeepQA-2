point : multiple vaccine do the job of individual vaccine , but more efficiently and faster . vaccines work because our body have a natural defense system call the immune system . the immune system recognize foreign body such a virus and bacteria and create antibody to destroy them . once your immune system have have contact with a particular virus or bacteria it know how to protect the body against it . vaccines use the body s ability to do this to help protect u against disease that may otherwise be deadly . vaccines contains part of the virus or disease and when injected stimulate the body to create antibody to fight and neutralize the disease . 
counterpoint : while multiple vaccine serve many , there be great concern for individual member of society . this be why the united states government , for example , have establish the vaccine injury compensation funds . the mission of these fund be that : the vicp be establish to ensure an adequate supply of vaccine , stabilize vaccine cost , and establish and maintain an accessible and efficient forum for individual find to be injure by certain vaccine . 1 
point : despite fear to the contrary , multiple vaccine cause no harm . being give immunization in many case mean that people receive a weakened virus . many believe that because of this they will have a weaken immune system and also suffer from long term body harm . the evidence suggest this be not the case , and that combine vaccination cause no adverse harm in the vast majority of case . 
counterpoint : the problem with study that claim to prove there be no harm with multiple vaccine , be that they be study that be firstly base on ethical restriction . a test that would conclusively prove the harm of multiple vaccine would require deliberately deny certain child inoculation . secondly , they monitor only the general population in preliminary study they exclude certain risk group and in study after the administration of vaccine usually contribute some of the negative result to other environmental factor . 
point : in 1998 , dr , andrew wakefield start a big campaign against multiple vaccination , when his research , publish in the lancet a medical journal a study on how mmr jab increase the likelihood of child for autism . because it be publish in a well know magazine it be consider a reliable source . 
counterpoint : even though major science research have show that there be no link between syndrome such a autism and multiple vaccination , a major aspect proponent of the theory claim be the ingredient mercury , that may cause many of the problem for brain cell and other behavioral function . for example accord to a study , mercury that be present in mmr readily cross the blood brain barrier , preferentially target nerve cell and nerve fiber and degrade them . 1 
point : all vaccination be test rigorously before they be approve for use . as vaccination represent an important and potential harmful intrusion in an individual s body , it be very important that they be safe . this be especially clear when government decide to make immunization obligatory ; they have to be sure they administer to their citizen safe vaccination . 
counterpoint : the problem with current testing be that , while they provide some control group usually those with rare reaction be not include in trial because it may represent even less than 1 of the population in a country . so even though there be deliberate screen for rare reaction , it be very likely that such event do not even get detect . the policy be that if serious reaction be find when the vaccine be in widespread use , the vaccine may be withdraw . but by then it have make already damage and endanger human life .
