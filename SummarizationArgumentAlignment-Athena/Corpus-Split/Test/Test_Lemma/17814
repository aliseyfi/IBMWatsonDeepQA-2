point : individuals be sovereign over their own body , and should be free to make choice which affect them and not other individual . since the pleasure gain from drug and the extent to which this weigh against potential risk be fundamentally subjective , it be not up to the state to legislate in this area . rather than pour wasted resource into attempt to suppress drug use , the state would be good off run information campaign to educate people about the risk and consequence of take different type of drug . 
counterpoint : this point make the assumption that drug use only affect the individual concern ; in reality , drug usage can have a significant effect on people close to the user , as well a wider society . people who can be affect include family who have to care for a user and victim of drug relate crime . in addition , in country with welfare state , there be an additional significant societal cost a many drug user cannot hold down job . 1 studies in the usa have show that parent often put their need for drug above the wellbeing of their child . 2 
point : those who want to use drug will take them whether they be legal or not and more be do so than ever before . in 1970 there be something like 1 , 000 problematic drug user in the uk , now there be over 250 , 000 . 1 legalization will also remove the glamour which surround an underground activity and so make drug use less attractive to impressionable teenager . for example , statistic suggest that cannabis use in the uk decline after it classification be lower from b to c . 2 
counterpoint : prohibition may not be work in the uk but that do not mean that prohibition be not work everywhere . in the us , the drug enforcement agency state that overall drug use in the united states be down by more than a third since the late 1970s . that s 9 . 5 million people few use illegal drug . we ve reduced cocaine use by an astound 70 during the last 15 year . 1 
point : currently in the uk , purity of illegal amphetamine be normally under 5 , and some tablet sell a ecstasy contain no mdma at all . instead , drug be adulterate cut with substance from chalk and talcum powder to completely different drug . 1 
counterpoint : part of the reason that drug be illegal be because of the health ramification , which exist even if a drug be pure . 
point : the illegality of drug fuel a huge amount of crime that could be eliminate if drug be legalise . price control would mean that addict would no longer have to steal to fund their habit , and a state provide drug service would put dealer out of business , starve criminal gang of their main source of funding . for example , an italian mafia family be make around 44bn a year from cocaine smuggling . 1 this represent something like 3 of italy s entire gdp and that from only one crime syndicate . 
counterpoint : drugs affect how people think , and they take away their ability to control their action rationally , and so people on drug be more likely to commit crime . the us drug enforcement administration state , crime , violence and drug use go hand in hand . six time as many homicide be commit by people under the influence of drug , a by those who be look for money to buy drug . most drug crime aren t commit by people try to pay for drug ; they re commit by people on drug . 1 
point : the taliban get most of it revenue from poppy , which provide the opium for heroin . they do this by intimidate local farmer who would otherwise sell their harvest at market . they then demand protection money a well , or else either another local warlord or the protector themselves would rob the farmer . something like 22 , 700 people have die in mexico since january 2007 from gangster who want to protect their revenue and almost the entire continent of south america , from brazil to colombia , have have their government destabilise by drug lord . 1 the hugely costly but unsuccessful war on drug could be end , starve terrorist of the profit of drug production . as a result peace and development could be bring to unstable drug produce state such a colombia and afghanistan . 
counterpoint : whether legal or illegal , drug will still be a source of income for warlord and terrorist group . instead of starve them off , the dealer become more competitive and low their price . the only way to stop these people use drug a a source of income be to remove poppy from afghan field , to destroy coca plantation . 
point : in most country where drug be illegal , tobacco and alcohol , which arguably have equally devastating consequence in society , be legal . in a uk study , alcohol be show to have the bad effect of any drug , yet the current law recognise that people should be able to choose whether they drink or not . 1 the same should be true of drug . 
counterpoint : perhaps alcohol and tobacco should also be illegal . however , one of the reason why alcohol rank so badly in such study be because of it legality ; if other drug be legal , we would see their usage go up and therefore the negative social effect they produce rise as well . 
point : in 2009 2010 , the tax revenue from tobacco in the uk be 10 . 5 billion . 1 if the state legalize drug , it can tax them and use the revenue from this practise to fund treatment . at the moment such treatment be difficult to justify a it appear to be spend ordinary taxpayer money on junky . 
counterpoint : if the state be to make money from tax drug , this undercut the supposed advantage of low price drug and will just encourage a black market to continue . in the uk , there be large black market for tobacco ; it be suspect that tax have not be pay on 21 of cigarette and 58 of hand roll tobacco consume . 1 furthermore , for the state to take revenue from this practise be morally wrong , whatever use the money be put to . the point of drug treatment be to help abuser off drug , but under the proposition s system the state would have a financial interest in prolong addiction .
