point : in a welfare state such a the united kingdom , everyone enjoy the same access to service provide by the government , and so it should stand to reason that everyone should also contribute equally to the funding of those service . as not all individual be equal in their wealth and income , it be impossible to do this on the basis of everyone pay in the exact same numerical amount of money . however , this parity can be achieve by everyone pay the same percentage of their income in tax to the government , and this be exactly what a flat tax be , and so equality in contribution to government service mirror equality in access to government service be achieve . this principle of equality be important for two reason : firstly , if wealthy citizen feel they be be unfairly burden by the current requirement that they pay high percentage of their income to fund government service than those on low income , they may feel a disincentive to work hard which create wealth for the whole economy , or may even be drive abroad to state with low rate of taxation or to tax haven . 1 secondly this remove the ability of the majority of a population to engage in what the french economist bastiat call 'legalized plunder' , where they a the majority of voter assign high percentage of income tax to the wealthy in order that the state may appropriate and redistribute it to them for their own use . 2 with a flat tax in place , there would be no ability for anyone to vote for a tax rise simply on other people and not on themselves , and thus such policy would receive more consideration and not be use by the majority simply to appropriate the property of others through the law . thus a flat tax be fairer a it equalize the basis on which everyone pay for access to equal service , and prevent a poor majority from victimize a wealthy minority through punitive rate of income tax for the wealthy , which may cause them to flee the country for other state with less taxation . 
counterpoint : the aim of a welfare state be to allow provide access to vital service for all , but especially for those who could not otherwise afford them to lift the burden of poverty somewhat . a flat tax , however , would actually increase the burden on the poor . 1 for example , if under a progressive taxation system the high rate of tax be 50 , and the low 10 , if tax revenue be to be maintain when switch to a flat tax system , then it would be impossible to simply extend the 10 rate of tax to all , a this would mean a large effective drop in revenue a 40 le be collect from the top bracket with no gain anywhere , and so the rate pay by all would have to be somewhere between 10 and 50 , mean an effective tax rise on the poor and middle class , while the rich receive an effective tax cut . this hardly seem 'fair' or in keep with the aim of a welfare state , a the argument purport to serve . 
point : the current system of 'progressive' taxation whereby high earner be tax a high percentage of their income require the identification and administration of multiple different tax bracket span the entire spectrum of earnings in a nation . this cause a number of problem . the bracket themselves may be largely arbitrary cut off line base around round number , with no real justification a to why one person increase their earnings by as little a 1000 should lead to them suddenly be propel to a new tax bracket , when the actual difference to their income be negligible in overall term . moreover , the administration of multiple tax bracket be incredibly complicate and difficult , require every taxpayer to record their income and expenditure in order to try and qualify for tax exemption and 'loopholes' in meticulous detail and then to properly express this on lengthy and complicated government form , a process which can cause anger , frustration and alienation amongst taxpayer . 1 in order to try and prevent tax evasion , government be consequently compel to have large bureaucracy that oversee this process and comb through look for fraud , a costly and lengthy process . this may be contrast with a flat tax system by take the example of tax on salary pay to employee by a company under both system . in the status quo , a tax collector must be aware in detail of exactly what be be pay to whom in order to ensure that everyone declare their income truthfully , allow them to be place in the correct bracket . however , under a flat tax , a tax collector could simply withhold the fixed flat tax rate for example 20 of the total company's payroll without need to know what be pay to whom , a every pound be tax at the same rate and thus it do not matter what go to whom . this would allow for a massive simplification of tax form , and for the down scaling of the costly government department dedicate to administer the different tax bracket . thus the simplicity of a flat tax be a significant advantage . 
counterpoint : the much acclaimed simplicity of the flat tax in fact make it too simple to properly reflect a very complicated reality . goods and service vary in order to make them accessible to different people ; there exist both luxury and economy version of the same good because company recognise that people have differ ability and willingness to pay , and hence price these good differently . it would therefore be strange for the state to tax both kind of good at the same rate , a if their respective buyer have the same discretionary income and could both afford to buy the product with the additional uniform flat tax on it . 
point : tax credit , deduction and loophole distort resource allocation in a market situation because people respond to the differ tax rate and so put more resource into the area which the loophole apply to than they would otherwise . for example , current tax credit for investment mean that more resource go into investment than they would in the absence of that credit , a the return on the placing of resource in this area be high than others a it be subject to a low rate of tax . a government may even set certain tax credit and loophole which favour certain industry or economic sector , such a agriculture , on the basis that this be politically useful in win vote , when this again distort resource allocation in the economy . these distortion may prove harmful a they cause certain sector to be over value or over invest in due to their favourable tax status , to the detriment and neglect of other more highly taxed area for example , manufacture which may in fact be the more economically sound . a flat tax would abolish all 'credits' and 'loopholes' and the politically influenced government discretion which decide who get credit and who do not and therefore restore genuine market condition without these harmful distortion . 1 
counterpoint : this argument ignore the fact that there be still another channel for the allocation of resource , namely the government . in the give example of agriculture tax credit verse manufacture without such credit , if resource do not go into agriculture because of the special credit , they would have go not into manufacture but into government through the closing of loophole , and thus the disappearance of a mean of be tax less , and government be far less neutral to the market than any other allocation . therefore , if the argument assume that the best allocation of resource be that which most closely resemble a genuinely free market , then in this example a flat tax produce a bad situation , a any allocation of economic resource in the private sector no matter how 'distorted be closer to the free market and thus 'better , than if those resource go into the hand of the government . so if reflect the market be the uppermost concern , a flat tax be a bad proposition a it bring into high rate of taxation many area which currently be less taxed 'loopholes' , thus distort the market even far as even more resource fall into government hand .
