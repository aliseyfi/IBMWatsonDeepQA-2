point : the nuclear industry be always keen to point out how cheap it be to produce a therm of energy through split an atom . however , these figure tend to leave out a few detail such a the decade of taxpayer s dollar it take to build a nuclear plant in the first place or the 20 , 000 year it take to reprocess the fuel rod afterwards . 
counterpoint : the cost of protect oil supply be significantly than any externality create by the nuclear industry . in addition to which most sector of the renewables industry have yet to even turn a dollar . solar power , for example would have to compensate the enormous quantity of land it take up to even cover it own cost i . 
point : nuclear put great store on the fact that it be a clean fuel however this assessment tend to ignore several factor in term of social and other cost . although much attention have be give to the possible harm of deal with fuel rod at the end of their life , much less be give to the mining of uranium in the first place . to take one of many example , in 2006 the navajo nation win a lengthy legal fight to prevent uranium mining ever take place on their land . similar effort by community in latin america have be less successful . 
counterpoint : the nuclear industry around the world have always seek to improve the right and protection of worker in uranium mine and to lessen the environmental impact of those mining activity i . 
point : were humankind to stop all nuclear energy use tomorrow we , a a specie , would have to deal with the repercussion of nuclear power for four time longer than human civilization have so far exist . polluting our own age be one thing but to bequeath such a heritage to generation a yet unimagined let alone unborn . to give this some context , in the case of just one isotope , plutonium 239 the most poisonous substance know to mankind have the ancient egyptians use this a an energy source to build the pyramid we would still be deal with it today and it would still have 235 , 000 year to go . 
counterpoint : all society inherit problem from previous generation this age have acquire a global population that have increase seven fold in the course of two generation and have a desperate need for energy . nuclear power fill that need and consistently work to ensure that it byproduct be render harmless .
