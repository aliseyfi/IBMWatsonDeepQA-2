point : the british rebate be an undeserved anomaly no other country have a similar arrangement to pay back part of it contribution to the eu budget . germany , the netherlands , denmark and sweden all make a big net contribution to the eu than britain do in proportion to the size of their population , 1 yet they do get special treatment . britain know how the eu operate when it choose to join more than thirty year ago if it didn t like the structure of the budget , whereby rich country pay more than poor one , it could have stay outside . in any case , a few billion euros a year be a small sum to pay for access to a huge continent wide market , the department for business innovation skills estimate that gdp in 2006 be 2 . 2 high than it would have be without a single market , 2 in britain this would be almost 50billion . 
counterpoint : while the uk be the only country to have so far receive a rebate the commission point out that the fontainbleu agreement be base on the principle that . any member state sustain a budgetary burden which be excessive in relation to it relative prosperity may benefit from a correction at the appropriate time . 1 this could clearly apply to many other country apart from britain , germany and other country could therefore ask for a rebate if they wish . while there be no other compensation mechanism like the rebate there be lump sum payment to the netherlands and sweden 2 while netherlands , sweden , germany and austria all have reduce rate of the european portion of vat , 3 and the same state also pay less towards the rebate . 4 
point : britain should give up the rebate in solidarity with the new member state . most of the ten recent entrant to the eu be still struggle to overcome the legacy of communist rule and be much poor than the previous 15 member state . in 2009 bulgaria and romania have less than half the average eu gdp per caput whereas the uk be about 120 eu average . 1 as one of the rich eu member , britain have a moral responsibility to contribute it share of the money need to allow the new member state to make a success of eu membership . it also have a self interest in contribute to their economic development , for a they become richer their citizen will increasingly buy the service and medium export in which britain specialises . indeed , because the rebate be pay for by all member state the new member state will be contribute payment towards britain s rebate clearly something which britain cannot attempt to defend give the disparity in wealth . 
counterpoint : britain should not feel sorry for the new eu member and give up it rebate out of pity for them . they choose to enter the eu and accept the term of membership include the rebate arrangement . indeed , it could be argue that membership be not necessarily good for the former communist state have escape one bureaucratic and ideological superstate , they have now choose to be rule by another , exchange moscow for brussels . eu membership will impose thousand of unnecessary regulation upon them and tie them to a european social model which be clearly fail in the western state both these thing could hold back their economic growth and leave them poor than they could have be outside the eu . even the development aid they will receive will largely be waste because it have to be spend in way brussels demand rather than in locally productive investment . 
point : it be worth give the rebate up in exchange for serious reform of the eu budget , particularly of the common agricultural policy which spend 40 of the eu s budget 1 on 3 of it population . 2 the cap not only waste taxpayer money , it also raise the cost of food for european consumer , ruin the environment and prevents poor farmer in the developing world from trade their way out of poverty . even in it own term it be a disaster , for most cap money go to a small number of rich landowner run huge agribusiness estate , not to small scale peasant farmer preserve the traditional rural way of life . if offer to give up the british rebate help to get agreement on reform , then it be a sacrifice well worth make . britain on the other hand favor use cap more to protect the environment rather than encourage food production . 3 
counterpoint : it might be worth give up the british rebate for serious cap reform , but it be unnecessary . if the cap be abolish , britain s net payment to the eu would automatically be much small anyway , so the rebate 66 of the difference between the uk s contribution to the eu and it receipt from it would also shrink away to insignificance . cap reform be worth do for it own sake , and other eu country will only agree to it once they realise that fact offer up the rebate will make no difference . in any case , even if the rebate be a useful bargaining chip to be cash in , there be no chance of individual country such a france or eire , spain , greece , italy , belgium , etc . agree to change the cap at present and any one country could prevent it , so britain should hold on to the rebate card . 
point : it be worth give up the rebate to remove a constant source of tension and ill feel between britain and it european partner . until the rebate be abandon , britain will never be at the heart of europe . this limit our ability to promote our other interest in europe , a every argument always end up back at the rebate , and weaken our moral authority . denmark for example be similarly euro sceptic but be fiercely oppose to the uk rebate and aim to scrap it during denmark s next eu presidency in 2012 . 1 because preserve the rebate have always be the prime minister s priority , every other british goal have be give up instead . this lead to bad deal for britain over the erm , at maastricht , and in 2002 when tony blair accept a franco german agreement to leave the cap unreformed until 2013 . this be because britain be inevitably on it own in any possible change to the rebate whereas on almost any other issue britain have ally . so when britain s opponent can link the rebate to an issue britain may be able to keep the rebate but will in other respect be on the losing side . 2 
counterpoint : britain do not want to be at the heart of europe it want to be in the eu , but not run by the eu . even if the rebate go , the uk would remain outside any eu core group of country , a it have choose not to join the schengen agreement on passport free movement , and to stay outside the euro . both these decision have very wide political and popular support in the uk , and neither will be change even if the rebate be weakly give away . so tension will continue between britain and it european partner , but at least by defend the rebate they will know that the uk be prepare to stand up for it interest and respect it . 
point : britain should not alienate it natural ally among the new member state by insist on the rebate . like britain , the new member state be largely economically liberal , anti federalist regard the future of the eu , and be pro american in term of foreign policy . as a result britain be much more likely to be able to work with poland , czech republic and hungary on these issue . 1 they also recognise that britain promote the cause of their membership throughout the 1990s and appreciate it willingness to grant immediate free movement to their citizen who wish to work in britain . in all these way they be closer to britain than to france or germany , the two big state who have traditionally dominate eu decision making . enlargement present britain with a great opportunity to influence the future direction of europe in partnership with these new state , but this opportunity will be lose if british insists on the rebate regardless of central and eastern european opinion . 
counterpoint : britain can be on good term with the east european state without drop the rebate . tony blair in his deal on the rebate in 2005 give a good deal to the new member of the eu which give much more in structural fund to these member and at the same time reduce the british rebate . 1
