point : open source software start from a completely different viewpoint of how product should be create . rather than resemble a traditional hierarchical organisation such a an early twentieth century business , an army or a monastic order where everyone have their own clearly define role and be tell how to proceed by a top down central authority , open source software development be more like an open market where everyone be engage in the same activity but come at it from different direction . i 
counterpoint : open source software be not bug proof and require far more update than the closed source alternative . in fact , the most successful open source software after the operating system linux be apache , an open source web server which hold around 65 of the global market , and mysql , an open source database i . both piece of software be far from innovative ; they be essentially just strip down version of closed source program . real innovation be drive by the profit motive and come from the knowledge that a firm can capitalize on a discovery , a google have do with it search algorithm . for this reason , the open source software movement be doom to produce mediocrity . as government choose it system for five to ten year , they should look to a reliable closed source solution which provide quality rather than buy into a nebulous idea of moral software . 
point : even when government do not ultimately select an open source program , by simply include them in the competitive bidding process , they have be able to radically change the approach that microsoft and other close source company take to produce it solution . 
counterpoint : the first firm to shift to the open source approach be netscape with it navigator web browser , because it be be outperform by the closed source microsoft internet explorer ; netscape make the shift out of desperation . this be exactly the same reason why sun and real have make their program open source solaris be be squeeze by windows base server software and realplayer by itunes and spotify . similarly , the patent which ibm be share and the narrow range of source code that microsoft be now open up relate to sector and product market where neither firm be dominant and where they hope they can leverage the program community to boost the quality of the software they be offer . since microsoft launch the open source initiative , it have not expand it in response to other government threaten to shift to open source software . therefore , we should not view this initiative a the beginning of a trend . 
point : economists use the term network effect to describe the phenomenon whereby , a several people use the same communication platform be it a specific device , such a a telephone , or a complicated service , such a facebook , it become more valuable for others to use because they can share and collaborate on work with a wider range of individual . 
counterpoint : the network effect be more complex than the argument that , if a government use a product , then it population will too . firstly , 90 of desktop pcs use microsoft product ; the cost for company and citizen to transition from microsoft to an open source alternative make it prohibitive in the short term . secondly , open source software work on the basis of a constant flow of update and minor change ; this may be suitable for server where it have already make most impact manage by it professional , but the average citizen or government worker would require continual training and re train before they could be trust to implement and use such update correctly . open source software be be jump on by some government a a tool to attack microsoft s monopoly but , in the end , it will cost them time and money .
