point : under the pressure of increase medium coverage and civil society initiative , school be be call upon to take up arm against childhood obesity , both by introduce more nutritional and physical education class , as well a transform the meal they be offer in their cafeteria . 1 
counterpoint : media sensationalism be a poor justification for any state intervention of any kind . what histrionic television documentary usually provide nothing more than a warning that our kid be in danger , along with a list of all the disease obesity might cause . but there be absolutely nothing that would explain how exactly something as drastic a a ban would do anything to begin solve this problem . 
point : schools be play an increasingly formative role , in the sense that they re be task with not only knowledge transfer , but also the creation of behavior and place emphasis on teach student how to apply their knowledge . 1 
counterpoint : given all the responsibility our society have transfer from parent onto school and educator in the 21st century , be it really sensible to include care for nutritional choice to this already bloat and unmanageable list ? 
point : there be a grow body of evidence link a healthy lifestyle , comprising of both adequate nutrition and physical exercise , with improved memory , concentration and general academic performance . 1 a study have show that when primary school student consume three or more junk food meal a week literacy and numeracy score drop by up to 16 compare to the average . 2 
counterpoint : again , if this be in fact true , then the incentive be already in place for good choice both on the side of student as well a school .
