point : every state have a right to shape it own destiny and that of it people . it must therefore have control over it defense policy , which necessarily shape it interaction with other state . the japanese constitution contain a clause , force into it by the american occupier , deny japan the power to develop a military of it own . the ironic thing be that the united states military now claim to be do japan a favor by retain it base , claim that because they have no military they cannot defend themselves . with the united states military go , japan will be able to begin reconsider it defense policy and to shape it in the image it see a befit itself , not how the united states envisions it1 . the presence of american troop in lieu of a japanese military hamper japan's ability to shape a defense policy on it own term , instead have to defer to the united states , whose interest might or might not coincide with japan's . in any event , the japan self defense forces be well suit to the task of defend japan , a it be the sixth large defense organization by expenditure in the world1 . it be not in any real danger of be overwhelm by aggressor in the absence of american protection . in order to fully take it place on the world stage and to become a full member of the community of free nation , japan must be able to direct it own defense and foreign policy . this can only truly happen once the united states withdraw it force from japan . 
counterpoint : japan do not need to shape it own military policy , nor do it seem to want to do so . the government could remove the clause in the constitution against build a military , but it have never choose to do so . the japanese appear happy enough to let the united states handle it defense , even if they grumble a bit about a few crime be commit by american soldier . the japanese be well off with the united states provide it protection anyway , since it ensure they be safe from harm from other regional player . 
point : the presence of american military personnel be particularly onerous in light of the multitude of crime commit by soldier over the year ; since the 1950s , more than 200 , 000 accident and crime have be commit , and more than 1000 japanese civilian have be kill , and a number of others have be the victim of assault and rape1 . most of the soldier who commit these crime never see justice since american soldier station in japan enjoy partial extraterritorial status , grant them a degree of immunity from prosecution by japanese authorities2 . for all of these reason , the japanese people have resoundingly state their desire for the united states to withdraw it force and close it base on their soil . this be demonstrate in every opinion poll and be reflect in the fact that current rule party in the japanese parliament , the democratic party of japan be elect partly on the basis of it promise to remove the base . without reason to be there , and unwanted by the people , the united states should remove it force from japan . 
counterpoint : whether or not the japanese people want them there or not , it be perfectly legitimate for the united states to maintain military base in japan . simply because they commit some crime do not mean the american soldier in japan be do more harm than good . in fact , the security they provide japan , which do not have a full military , be vital in light of potential threat from other east asian power , such a north korea or china1 . 
point : the united states may once have have a legitimate reason to maintain a military presence in japan ; it have a genuine interest in institute a democratic regime and enforce a peace after the violence of world war ii . yet now , more than fifty year on , japan be a thriving , robust democracy that have prove it to be a responsible and markedly conservative actor in international relation . the presence of the united states , originally mean to enforce peace , no longer have any place in japan . yet it persist , and not only do it keep it base and soldier on base , it also expect the japanese government to contribute to their upkeep through a special sympathy budget levy from the japanese exchequer each year , which have cost the japanese taxpayer more than 100 billion since 19871 . clearly , the treatment of the united states of japan through it maintenance of it force be illegitimate . 
counterpoint : the united states have the legal legitimacy of the post war treaty sign by the japanese government , and ratify when the first independent parliament take power after the military governorship end . by all legal account , the united states have every right to maintain it force in japan . 
point : japan be a nation with a now ingrain democratic tradition and a strong liberal economic system , which make it the perfect actor to engage politically with state in east asia on behalf of the international community , as well a to serve a an example of the benefit of liberal democratic value to a society . japan can serve a an exemplar to it neighbor still labor under tyrannical regime , such a north korea and burma myanmar and to help promote an organic progression to democracy in the region . all of these activity be hamper , however , by the presence of american military base in japan . when japan seek to engage with despotic state and to reach out to their people , tyrant can point to the base a exemplify japan's position a a puppet of the united states and not truly an independent nation at all1 . so long a it string appear to be be pull by the united states , japan will unable to effectively promote democracy and liberalism amongst it neighbor . by withdraw it troop , the united states gain an influential ally in the promotion of view in keep with it own . 
counterpoint : the removal of american military base from japan will not improve perception of japan by it neighbor . this be due to the fact that it be not the presence of the united states in japan that make many east asian state wary of it , but rather japan's imperial history . china and korea remember vividly the japanese invasion of their territory and have in many way not forgive them for the atrocity commit by japanese soldier during that time . japan will always be a tainted actor in the region , whether the united states have base within it border or not . 
point : the removal of american soldier from japan will greatly benefit the united states' effort in other region of the world . at present group oppose to the united states , such a al qaeda , use japan a an example of american imperialism ; they point out that when the united states build a military base , they rarely vacate it1 . this have lead to reticence on the part of country such a pakistan to ask for american aid in fight terrorist within it border and to terrorist organization be able to recruit soldier fear subjection to an american empire . closing it base in japan will serve to soften the united states' appearance of empire . it will demonstrate that if a base be place in a country it will be remove when it be no longer need or want . this make call upon the united states for aid appear less costly to a state's sovereignty and make the presence of american base elsewhere in the world seem less permanent and odious . all of these perceptual change will help to further american foreign policy , a it will be meet by more compliant , less oppositional state . 
counterpoint : removing it base from japan will do little to improve international perception of the united states . the fact that be willing to remove it force from a state more than fifty year after it have become a stable democracy and only then due to extreme local opposition to their presence be not much of an example to give to the rest of the world . the removal of it base would be see a nothing more than a token gesture , and would certainly not be accept a indicative of a willingness to leave state when they ask it to do so . 
point : the day of large stand army do battle with one another be over . power be not measure by the number of foot soldier a state have , but by it arsenal of fighter , bomber , drone , and aircraft carrier . the united states have accept this fact belatedly , choose to maintain a large stand army while also develop more formidable and useful method of warfare and project power1 . however , escalate cost be start to make this effort to eat it cake and have it too financially impossible . in order to remain the dominant military power in the 21st century , the united states must accept that it military investment must be make more intelligently , and focus on develop smart weapon , such a unmanned drone , as well a platform for conduct war in the modern world , such a aircraft carrier . removing it base from japan would be a first step toward reorganize the military along these more rational line . the effort to scale back on ground force must start somewhere , and japan be as good a any , consider it lack of need for such force . 
counterpoint : a shift away from conventional ground force be not a wise strategic move for the united states . its experience in iraq and afghanistan serve a striking example of the value of have boot on the ground 1 . without a conventional ground force , bomber and drone can do little . rolling back it overall complement of such force be thus strategically ill advise .
