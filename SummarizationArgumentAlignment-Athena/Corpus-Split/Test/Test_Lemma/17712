point : we live in a market world . financial transaction and trade be conduct trans nationally . every state be in competition with every other state . this reality have necessitate trade partnership , such a nafta , and even movement towards social and political union , such a the european union . the next step be to enfranchise people on a global scale . if many of the trend , transaction and phenomenon that affect their life be global , then people should have a direct say in global decision making . there would be no good way to ensure this than by create a global parliament . 
counterpoint : there could actually be no bad way to ensure individual's voice influence the global decision . the large the democracy , the small the significance of a single vote . the nation state be the very medium through which the interest of individual in global matter be transmit to the rest of the world , and it be the collective power of the state that be the best way of ensure it citizen wish be fulfil , wish that be necessarily dependent on national context . 
point : the creation of a global parliament would end all war . the interplay of political life would engender and reinforce an attitude of community and share goal . armed conflict be anathema to such a mindset . just a the history of consensual , shared decision making via the parliamentary process have virtually remove violence from the menu of political action in western liberal democracy , so would a practice of parliamentary debate and decision effect such change on a global scale . this be just the same a how parliament within state have help turn those state into nation and create a national consciousness even when unite disparate people a in the united states . it be also be show to occur internationally with the creation of the european parliament which be slowly gain in power . 11 http : www . epha . org a 3894 3 
counterpoint : it be utopianism at it absolute bad to dream of perpetual peace be bring about by a world parliament . it be difficult to see how the power balance of international relation will be alter . states that be big enough and powerful enough will continue to pursue aggressive and oppressive policy in defiance of resolution demand them to cease . they will do so because they have the material and military capacity to ignore attempted restraint on their action . to give two example , tibet would not enter this parliament a a full member but a part of china , chechnya would still be part of russia . what dictate whether war be prevent be realpolitik ; action be take when it be in the interest of those state , which be powerful enough to act . when war can be prevent and it be strategically useful to prevent it then action be take the gulf war . but where action would involve incalculable loss and serve no immediate self interest chechnya and tibet it will not be take . even today , most war be civil , intra state war . 1 it be difficult to see how a world parliament would be good in address these than national government . 1http 4 : www . correlatesofwar . org especially the data set on intra state war 4 
point : many of the most serious problem in today's world be international , whether they be of an environmental or a political nature . to attempt the solution of these problem through the negotiation of nearly 200 individual sovereign state be futile . even if any agreement be possible and agreement be by no mean guarantee it will be characterize by insufficiency because of compromise between the many different power interest of the separate sovereign state . this have be often exemplify in the case of negotiation involve global interest such a climate change , most recently at copenhagen in 2010 . this consequently , nation state should cede sovereignty over very important international issue so that effective action can be take . world government should be an ideal towards which we gradually work . the universal problem of human right and the environment obviously cry out for universal solution . but gradually , we can foresee other issue such a taxation policy , education and law and order be decide at international level . the principle behind this be that human be fundamentally similar . ethnicity , religion or other cultural consideration can add variety and spice to daily life but they should not be obstacle to the recognition of globally share interest and , consequently , to the introduction of global decision making . 
counterpoint : this argument do not advocate for global government , but global governance , the key difference be that global government require the amalgamation of nation state into one world state , while global governance advocate cooperation base on share value . the issue of human right be indeed universal . to that end , intergovernmental cooperation have secure the un universal declaration of human rights and numerous subsequent convention . there be many intergovernmental conference on human right and other global issue such a the environment . and where agreement be not reach , or be not satisfactory , this reflect the genuine difference of interest and opinion amongst the different nation state ; it would be wrong , if not impossible for a global government to impose a single policy in these circumstance . 
point : calls for world government in the post world war ii era imply a deep suspicion about the sovereign state's potential a a vehicle for moral progress in world politics . emery reves' influential the anatomy of peace be a condemnation of the nation state a a political institution : the modern bastille be the nation state , no matter whether the jailer be conservative , liberal or socialist . echoing rousseau , reves argue that nation state threaten human peace , justice and freedom , by divert fund from important need , prolong a global climate of mistrust and fear , and create a war machine that ultimately precipitate actual war . the experience of the world war thus make it especially difficult to view state a agent of moral progress1 . 1 http : www . archive . org detail anatomyofpeace009815mbp 8 
counterpoint : conflict and interest group cannot be eradicate by eliminate the nation state . different interest will still exist , and without the buffer that international politics provide , they might prove even more difficult to consolidate into a decision . the world state be at even a great risk of war between those interest group a they will not have the release valve that be the state to regulate the expression of their interest .
