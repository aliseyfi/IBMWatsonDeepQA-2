point : although overall level of crime in england and wales have decrease over the previous decade , the number of violent crime against the person have markedly increase . these be the offence which raise most grave public concern and which be unlikely to leave conventional fingerprint . the national commission on the future of dna evidence estimate that thirty per cent of crime scene contain the blood , semen , or saliva of the perpetrator1 . dna detection will be best equip to identify the guilty . a full database ought to allow the use of dna a an investigative tool where no suspect have yet be identify . studies support this assertion ; 'the overall detection rate for crime of 23 . 5 rise to 38 where dna be successfully recovered'2 . furthermore , in the united states , the number of reported rape drop to it low level in two decade due in large part to the use of dna evidence31 weathersbee , f . 1999 , march 1 . national commission on the future of dna evidence . retrieved may 19 , 2011 , from national institute of justice : 6 2 phillipson , g . 2009 , november 19 . the case for a complete dna database . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from guardian : 5 3 mcgreal , c . 2009 , october 8 . number of report rape in us drop to low level in two decade . retrieved may 18 , 2011 , from guardian : 7 
counterpoint : the most serious violent crime , notably the offence of rape and murder , be most commonly commit by individual know to the victim . when the suspect for the commission of a crime be obvious , dna detection be superfluous . moreover , it be invidious to propagate the belief in the public that crime can be solve , or criminal deter , by computer wizardry ; evidence collect by a uk parliamentary commission suggest dna match lead to crime detection in as little a 0 . 3 of cases1 . ultimately , unless the dna be use to identify a genetic cause for aggression , violent crime will continue to be committed1 home affairs committee . 2010 , march 4 . the national dna database . retrieved may 19 , 2011 , from uk parliament : 8 
point : the increase use of dna evidence will minimize the risk of future wrongful conviction . an fbi study indicate that since 1989 dna evidence have exclude the primary candidate in 25 of sexual assault cases1 . this not only save valuable police time , but ensure suspect be not call in for unnecessary and stressful questioning . moreover , forensically valuable dna can be find on evidence that have exist for decade , and thus assist in reverse previous miscarriage of justice . there have be a number of recent , high profile case of death row inmates be release on the ground of dna evidence , unavailable when they be first convict . a dna database would not merely render wrong verdict right , but prevent such verdict ever be make . 1 u . s . department of justice . 1996 , june . convicted by juries , exonerated by science . retrieved may 19 , 2011 , from u . s . department of justice : 9 
counterpoint : the database be immaterial to the acquittal or exclusion of non offender . where a primary suspect have be identify , a dna profile ought to be create and compare to the crime scene data . likewise , where suspicion persist concern the guilt or innocence of a convict individual , a sample of dna can be take . the database have predominant application in 'non suspect' case , and not the circumstance where the suspect or felon be already identify . it be also important to keep claim regard the efficacy of dna match in context , chief constable sims of the british metropolitan police state that of '4 . 9 million crime report each year , of which 1 . 3 million be 'detected' lead to charge ' only 33 , 000 involve dna matching1 . 1 home affairs committee . 2010 , march 4 . the national dna database . retrieved may 19 , 2011 , from uk parliament : 8 
point : a dna database be not intend to replace conventional criminal investigation . the database ought to identify the potential suspect , each of whom can then be investigate by more conventional mean . during 2008 09 in the united kingdom , 'almost 6 in 10 crime scene profile load to the national dna database be match to a subject profile'1 . there be no possibility of escape the provision of technical evidence before a court . doctors , ballistics expert , forensic scientist be already a common feature of the large criminal trial . the jury system be actually a bastion against conviction on account of complicate scientific fact . the british jury be instruct to acquit a defendant where they find reasonable doubt . if the genetic data and associated evidence be insufficiently conclusive , or present without sufficient clarity , the jury be oblige to find the defendant not guilty . 1 ndnad . 2009 . national dna database : annual report 2007 09 . retrieved may 19 , 2011 , from 11 
counterpoint : there be no such guarantee that a dna database would have such an effect . in fact , there be a serious risk that genetic evidence will be use to the exclusion of material that might prove the innocence of the suspect . it be far likely that more crime will be prosecute on account of largely circumstantial evidence . moreover , there be the possibility that not only the police , but also the jury , will be blind by science . it seem unlikely that jury will be able to comprehend , or more importantly , to question , the genetic information that be yield by the database . the irony be that forensic evidence have be instrumental in establish the miscarriage of british justice in the 1970s , but might now serve to create miscarriage of it own .
