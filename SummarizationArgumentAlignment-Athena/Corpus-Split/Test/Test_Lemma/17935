point : the long term unemployed in america be important to the economic recovery . whilst those who be temporarily unemployed will eventually come back into employment and start contribute to the economy , they will often be offset by those losing work . for the u . s . economy to gain headway , spare capacity must be create in the economy for those who have not be employ for a long period of time . should the u . s . be able to harness these worker and create extra employment capacity to keep them in employment , then the u . s . economy will see a boost a the number of people gain work will outnumber those lose work to a more significant level than see ordinarily in an economic recovery . 
counterpoint : whilst long term unemployment be an issue within america , it be not an issue to be focus on during a time of economic recovery and potential recession again . in a recession there be significantly more people who suffer from temporary unemployment because business that be unable to survive the hardship of the recession often shut down . 
point : one of the more divisive problem in america be the increase inequality between the wealthy and member of other class . the harm that could , and have result from this extend to the occupy protests in the tail end of 2011 , as well a riot with the rich consistently seem to get rich despite the poor economic climate , many of the less rich within the american economy feel that the state be play against them , confer advantage on those best able to lobby politician and make large election campaign donation . this be problematic when it be state mechanism that will enable american s who lack access to costly university to better educate and train themselves , thus make them more employable thus allow them to help push the american economy out of recession . 
counterpoint : the social problem that have take root in america result from a number of converge cause . while many individual may desperately want to contribute to the debate surround these problem , attribute the decline performance of the american economy highly visible social division be mislead and unproductive . 
point : the american jobs act help small business and be also set to significantly increase the number of job available to people . small enterprise be particularly important in the creation of job because these business tend to be start up business . many start ups be entrepreneurial in character , and succeed or fail on their ability to identify and exploit new market . increasing investment in new and emergency market spur the creation of additional job within those market . thanks to the cut in payroll tax contain in the jobs act , many small business will stand to benefit by gain some of the money pay to the government back . the president s plan will also eliminate payroll tax entirely if firm add new worker or increase the wage of their current worker . as such , there will be significant incentive for small business to hire more worker . 1 
counterpoint : the american jobs act may be project to create a lot of job . however , this come follow tax cut and a fiscal stimulus package in 2009 . in the past these measure to help the economy fail , with unemployment remain stagnant at around 25 million despite the effort by the government in 2009 .
