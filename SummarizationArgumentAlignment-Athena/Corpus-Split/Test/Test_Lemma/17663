point : joining the european single currency the euro may appear unfavourable to britain , but the negative effect of not join would be more unfavourable . as explain by anthony browne in the euro : should britain join ? , euroland business be now able to raise money for investment across the entire single currency zone , make it easy and cheap . british company , on the other hand , be still largely constrain to drum up money from within britain if they want to expand . 1 eurozone business find it easy to raise money , for they be spared currency conversion charge . the carmaker nissan have previously tell the british government that eliminate exchange rate risk by sit production in the same currency zone a it sale market will be it preferred option 2 . 
counterpoint : britain do not have to become a part of the euro to benefit from the eu economically . britain have already strike the right balance between eu involvement and manage her own economy . we be already part of the single market , and get rid of the barrier put up by have separate currency will make little difference . it be the removal of all the other barrier such a tariff that matter far more . the economy of scale be already here from the eu s almost 300 million consumer have an effect . 1 . accepting the euro could very well upset this balance with very negative effect ; staying out , we have the advantage of a more flexible economy , more adaptable labour market , and low tax . therefore , it be more advantageous for britain to keep the pound whilst maintain eu membership . 
point : london will far lose it position a europe s financial centre , and the financial influence this bring with it . britain s stay out of the euro have already deplete london s status a the european financial centre . as explain by anthony browne in the euro : should britain join ? , the european central bank the second most powerful in the world have a natural home in london , but end up in frankfurt because of our indecision over the euro . 1 germany use this to her advantage , for it reinvigorate germany s bid to ensure that frankfurt become europe s financial centre , with a massive office building programme to rival london s docklands . 1 germany seize london s sphere of influence will only increase if britain stay out of the euro . moreover , if britain s indecision over the euro continue , it would lead to a serious rethink by foreign owner of many of the city s financial institution about where their core activity should be locate . 1 if britain do not join the euro , her economic activity both at home and between fellow member states will be badly affect . 
counterpoint : this have simply not be the case ; since the launch of the euro in 2002 , london have consolidate her position a the financial centre of europe . there be no need for britain to join the euro , she can profit from the financial influence london exercise while her mainland european counterpart use the single currency . as explain by anthony browne in the euro : should britain join ? , at the launch of the euro that what be effectively regional financial centre such a paris lose any reason for their existence and saw all european business drain away to europe s real financial centre , london . 1 moreover , britain be not wholly reliant on her european counterpart for business ; more people work in financial service in london than live in frankfurt , it only likely rival . we have the english language and a time zone that mean we can deal with new york and tokyo in the working day . 1 if the british economy do not even need mainland europe for business , even less it need the single currency . 
point : there will be initial conversion cost and inflation , but this will be short live . if britain accept the euro , there will be far more powerful force price transparency and economy of scale in a massive single market that will continuously push the price of british good down to european level result in massive saving . 1 . the end of cheap good justify the mean of attain them . 
counterpoint : no ; cheap good come at a high monetary price and a high price of a chaotic turnaround . even before the euro have take effect , it be go to be costly ; converting to the euro will also cost business , and shop in particular , billion of pound , and that be bind to be pass on to their customer . 1 once it fully take effect , the euro will also lead to high inflation and more red tape , encumber business and their customer with even high cost . 1 and so the initial monetary cost and inconvenience be not go to be short live , but will in fact spread . any silver lining of cheap good price eventually be not go to be worth the upheaval of complication and inflation it creation entail . 1 the euro : should britain join ? , anthony browne , p . 102 
point : before the arrival of the single currency , holiday maker would spend much money on prepare for the trip , before they have even buy a single souvenir or postcard ; traveller tour this fragmented continent could spend large amount of their money simply change it from one currency to another . 1 the loss incur by currency conversion would be eliminate and accommodation abroad will also be cheap and easy to book ; joining the euro will also make it cheap to send money around europe . sending money to book a holiday cottage in another country with another currency can cost 40 . within euroland , it would cost less than one euro much less than one pound . 2 
counterpoint : this theory do not transfer to practice successfully . questions of lifestyle such a holiday under the euro cannot be treat in isolation . converting to the euro will have a series of knock on effect which be all interconnected , affect and effect by one another . one of these be the inevitability of high inflation . with increase inflation , there will be increase unemployment ; there will be even more british jobless who cannot afford to go on holiday . moreover , a explain by anthony browne in the euro : should britain join ? , these saving be a mere fraction of the total cost of go on holiday . 1
