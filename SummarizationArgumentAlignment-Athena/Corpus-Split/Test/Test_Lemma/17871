point : many people in both ukraine and georgia wish to join nato , and that be the best reason for welcome them into the alliance . nato be an alliance of democratic state and should respond positively to the request of a sovereign nation . in georgia a non binding referendum on whether to join nato show 77 of voter in favor of joining . 1 polls show that some 50 of ukrainians in 2002 say that would support ukraine s membership in nato if a referendum on this issue be hold . 2 
counterpoint : it be far from the settle will of the georgian and ukrainian people that they wish to join nato . georgia s president saakashvili do wish to join , but after his disastrous attempt to regain control of south ossetia be unable to bring his country with him . saakashvilli be defeat in parliamentary election and run up against his term limit at the end of 2013 1 open the way towards good relation with russia . public opposition to nato membership in ukraine since the us lead war in iraq 2003 outweigh support for join the alliance . 2 ukraine be split over nato membership , with most of the russian speaking east of the country firmly oppose to the idea , and only about 30 support overall . 3 the crisis of ukraine s pro western coalition over how to respond to the conflict in georgia show how divisive the question be ; the president firmly support georgia while the pm keep quiet . 4 in any case , nato membership should not automatically be extend to every nation which wish it , but only offer when the current member of the alliance judge it to be in their strategic interest to do so . 
point : expansion to include georgia and ukraine be in the interest of nato . after more than a decade without a clear role , the alliance now once again stand for the principle of solidarity between western liberal democracy . the hope of the 1990s for a new world order in which a democratic and liberalising russia would see partnership with nato and other western club a strongly in it own interest die during the presidency of vladimir putin . russia once again pose a threat to europe and need to be contain or at least show that nato have not forget about it . this be show by president putin s continue lash out at foreign country for funding ngos and plan to boost defense spending . 1 extending nato up to russia s southern border will signal the west s strength and determination and force russia to respect the alliance and it member . 
counterpoint : further expansion be not in nato s interest . the alliance be base on the principle that the security of one be the security of all , so that all member will go to war if any one member be attack . this be a very serious commitment and should not lightly be extend to new nation . the irresponsible manner in which georgia provoke a conflict with russia , ignore us warning , show the danger of be suck into quarrel in which most nato member have no strategic interest . it be obvious from this conflict that georgia could not defend itself so the burden would fall on nato . 1 like the breakaway region of georgia , ukraine also contain many russian speaker who look to moscow for protection , especially in the crimea which host russia s black sea fleet . 2 if ukraine have be a member of nato when russia move troop into crimea then nato would be a dangerous confrontation with russia . 
point : there be a strong precedent for let ukraine and georgia join nato . latvia , lithuania and estonia be also former soviet state , and russia object to their entry into nato quite as much a it object today about it black sea neighbour . 1 yet russia be not allow a veto over their future , and it soon get over it annoyance , continue to participate in joint forum with nato and to cooperate with the usa over afghanistan , north korea and nuclear non proliferation . so nato be already commit to the defence of state in russia s near abroad , and should not fear further expansion . 
counterpoint : in retrospect , the decision to welcome the former soviet state in the baltic into nato appear foolish . they continue to have a prickly relationship with russia , which have some legitimate concern about the treatment of large russian minority in latvia and estonia , and about the siting of us nuclear defence . their entry into nato be force upon russia , which naturally saw it a an aggressive move design to humiliate it , and mark the point when it pro western policy shift to a more nationalist and confrontational approach . 1 it also weaken the unity of nato a there be quite legitimate doubt a to whether all the alliance s member would really go to war with russia over the integrity of , say , estonia . given this history , it would be madness to compound the problem by extend nato membership to georgia and ukraine .
