point : the present system of earmark in congress be wide open to abuse . the party leadership in each house can use the offer of pork , or the threat to withhold it to enforce party discipline . logrolling occurs whereby an earmark be obtain in return for support on an unrelated piece of legislation . all this lead to legislator who put party above country and vote for bad legislation in pursuit of their own vested interest . they basically be federal dollar that member of congress dole out to favor seeker often campaign donor . in the process , lawmaker advocate for the company , help them bypass the normal system of evaluation and competition . 1 forcing pork out in the open by make congress vote to defend it after a presidential line item veto be the best way to remedy matter . overall the president be more accountable to the people a a whole than individual representative , and with their national mandate , more able to stand up to powerful interest group . 
counterpoint : there be other mean by which cut earmark could be achieve , without the drastic step of mutilate the work of the founding fathers . for a start , congress could just ban the use of earmark , unfortunately an attempt in 2010 be defeat 39 56 in the senate . 1 existing rescission power could be toughen by require congress to hold a prompt vote on presidential request for appropriation cut , rather than ignore them a invariably happen now . the impoundment power remove in 1974 could be restore . the convention that spend item in committee report should be bind on the executive could be challenge . and the practice of legislate massive omnibus spending bill could be end ; more , small and more focused bill would make pork more obvious and make it more viable for a president to veto a whole bill without cause the federal government to collapse for want of funding . 
point : the line item veto could prevent omnibus appropriation bill a with a possible veto there would be little advantage to congress in bundle such spending together . in recent decade , huge omnibus appropriation bill have become the norm , these be bill that package many , often unrelated , proposal in a single , very long piece of legislation 1 . presidents have have to accept these bill in their entirety or see the federal government shut down for lack of spending authority . 
counterpoint : the line item veto do not directly tackle omnibus appropriation bill so it be not give that have the veto will reduce the number of such bill even if it do reduce the incentive to create them . 
point : amending the us constitution to allow the president a line item veto would be fiscally responsible . congress have prove itself incapable of restrain spending , even a the budget deficit have balloon in recent year . in fiscal year 2008 there be 11 , 610 earmark specific appropriation request by individual congressmen , mostly to benefit specific group in their district or state costing 17 . 2 billion with a total of 271 billion from 1991 to 2008 . 1 many of these item be pork , use taxpayer money on project of dubious value in order to ingratiate the congressman involve with group of voter or interest group . typically huge spending bill bloat with such wasteful appropriation be vote through by congressmen who have no opportunity or inclination to even read the whole thing . at present the president have to accept or sign the whole bill , despite their distaste for many of the item within it . the propose amendment would change that and allow the president to sign the bill a a whole , while cancel spending he regard as wasteful , of low priority , or properly a matter for state or local government . 
counterpoint : the line item veto power will not do much to restrain spending or reduce the federal budget deficit . earmarks amount to less than 0 . 5 of total us government expenditure , 1 and only 1 . 5 of discretionary spending in 2009 . 2 given that many earmark will be consider worthwhile project by the president , any line item cut will be so small a to be negligible . if we be serious about control spending and cut the deficit we would need to think about restrain huge entitlement programme like medicare and social security , raise tax , reduce military spending , and lift the retirement age far . all these will require a serious , bipartisan approach on the part of both legislator and the white house . when compare to the 2009 deficit of 500 billion or the total budget of 3 trillion3 the line item veto debate be just a distraction from that much more important task . 
point : all that be be propose here be give the president the same power enjoy by 44 out of 50 state governor . one strength of a federal system be the way our states be our laboratory of democracy and we can look to them for the best practice and innovative idea . they point the way to solution that others , include the federal government , can adopt . and at state level the line item veto power be very valuable in restrain spending and prevent waste ; congressman john baldacci argue that unlike the federal government , the states by and large do not run deficit and they keep their book in order and spend only what they have each year . they pass realistic budget and they stick to them . it be certain that this authority be a crucial part of keep spending in check . while it may not be use with great regularity in many states , the fact that it be available encourages the legislature and the governor to reach agreement on spending issue and not to crowd the spending with extraneous matter . 1 because it be use irregularly there have be no general erosion of legislative authority within these state . 
counterpoint : the federal government be not just a state government writ large , and the president be not equivalent to a state governor . what work at state level would be neither effective nor appropriate for the united states a a whole . state legislature have a different and more limited role than congress , often with tax and spending power that be much more restricted in the state constitution . the need for super majority or referendum for tax rise and prohibition on deficit spending be the real reason states' budget be balance , not the line item veto . theoretical literature to date have provide no clear prediction regard the effect of the line item veto on the tax level , and the empirical literature have provide conflict result . 1 it be likely to be the same with spending .
