point : democracy mean self governance by the people , wherein citizen have the fundamental right to decide how they be to be govern and by whom . an appoint or indirectly elect upper house violate this principle , because allow a group of individual to exercise power without have to explain or justify themselves to the public . 
counterpoint : democracy isn't just 'direct elections' . democracy be a mean to ensure good governance . stating that an appoint or indirectly elect upper house be 'undemocratic' be not enough . instead , the proposition should show why an appoint or indirectly elect upper house hinders good governance . moreover , give the fact that the upper house be either appoint by the directly elect executive , a in canada , or elect by directly elect provincial legislature , a in the netherlands , the people still have the right to decide how they be govern , only indirectly . 
point : when an upper house be directly elect , it will be perceive to be more legitimate by the public , because the public see their political view directly translate into a legislative branch , albeit in a different way than the low house . this enhance legitimacy will help the upper house in perform their constitutional duty : whenever the upper house disagree with either the low house or the executive , the upper house can now strengthen their position by point to the public support it have . 
counterpoint : a directly elect upper house obfuscate the political process . an upper house have a different role in the political process than the low house : the low house have to channel public opinion whereas the upper house have to provide critical scrutiny and sober second thought . its legitimacy therefore doesn't stem from back in public opinion but from careful reflection and well think out argument . 
point : politicians who elect or appoint the member of the upper house have an incentive to put their friend an ally there , because this will make their decision make easy . this be patronage pure and simple : the public will have a hard time send them away when , if ever , a scandal break because the member of the upper house don't depend on public opinion to remain in their seat . an example be the case of a senator in the netherlands , sam pormes . after an opinion magazine reveal he once have partake in terrorist activity , it take almost a year and several mediation attempt to get him remove from parliament . 1 
counterpoint : appointers and elector have to think about their reputation more . unethically and unprofessionally behave member of the upper house can still be send away , either by the politician who appoint or elect them or by independent inquiry . an example of this be of a senator in the netherlands , sam pormes . after an opinion magazine reveal he once aid freedom fighter in an assault on the dutch government , he be send away after careful inquiry . 1
