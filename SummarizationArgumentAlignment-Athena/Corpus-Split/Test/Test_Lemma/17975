point : it s in the interest of employer . a long , incurable and debilitate condition have stricken one of their employee . they will have to make provision for possible sickness cover and replacement worker , potentially for medical and or retirement cost . hiv can make people tired and can lead to be sick more often a it mean the immune system will not be able to fight off infection as well a it normally would . 1 the employee s productivity might be reduce to the point at which their continued employment be no longer viable . if thing be make difficult for employer with hiv positive worker , then they be less likely in the future to employ people who they suspect be hiv positive . employers must be listen to in this debate in many hiv stricken country , they re the last thing between a semi function society and complete economic and social collapse . traditional right idea such a concern about privacy of medical record be less important than the benefit to society of be able to cope with the unique problem of hiv more effectively . 
counterpoint : it be in the interest of employer not to have to pay their employee . it be in the interest of employer not to offer vacation time . it be in the interest of employer not to spend money on ensure health and safety measure be comply with . 
point : it s in the interest of the hiv positive employee . right now , although in many country it be illegal to fire someone for have hiv 1 prejudice employer can claim that they didn t know their employer have hiv when they fire him , so they must have be act on other ground . the employee then have to try and prove that they do know , which can be very hard . furthermore , once inform the employer can reasonably be expect to display a minimum level of understanding and compassion to the employee . 
counterpoint : it s not a if the employee can t tell their employer at present it s that he or she could , but doesn t want to . they get to decide what s in their best interest include what s likely at trial and sadly , that will often be keep quiet about his condition . 
point : it s in the interest of other worker . the possibility of transmission , while very unlikely , be real and one they have a right to know about so a to be able to guard against it . while most of the time it will not be problem a transmission require a transfer of bodily fluid this may occasionally happen in a workplace . 1 this be particularly true of healthworkers e . g . doctor , nurse , dentist , midwife , paramedic , etc who should have both a moral and a legal obligation to disclose if they be hiv positive . even outside the medical field industrial accident may expose employee to risk . employers have a duty to protect their workforce . 
counterpoint : working with someone with hiv do not put you at risk . suggesting that it do serf to perpetuate the myth that do such harm to hiv positive people who already suffer too much . to clarify : aids cannot be transmit through external , intact skin . it cannot pas through the air like cold germ . sweat , urine , tear and saliva cannot transmit hiv . whilst blood , seminal fluid , vaginal fluid and breast milk can , how often be such fluid encounter at work ? even if they be , and such fluid be hiv positive , they must enter another s body through mucus membrane , directly into the bloodstream e . g . via injection , or from mother to child via breastfeeding or in the womb . what workplaces risk such transferral ? 
point : businesses ought to take a responsible and active position on hiv . the issue isn t go to go away . successful program design to help hiv positive employee remain in the workplace for as long a they want to do so should be develop . procedures for treat personnel with fairness and dignity must be put in place . the potential fear and prejudice of other employee must be combat . the beginning of that process be ensure they know about the problem and , crucially , the scale of it . without knowledge of the number involve , employer may put in place inadequate medical and pension arrangement that will ultimately prove inadequate . 
counterpoint : all these worthwhile aim can be achieve without employee have to tell their employer of their hiv status on an involuntary basis . the scale of the problem can be easily infer from national and regional medical statistic . for example , mine company in south africa have put in place excellent programme to combat prejudice and treat sick employee without compulsory disclosure .
