point : the death penalty can also help provide closure for the victim's family and friend , who will no longer have to fear the return of this criminal into society . they will not have to worry about parole or the chance of escape , and will thus be able to achieve a great degree of closure . mary heidcamp , a chicago woman whose mother's killer face the death penalty before the state governor commute the sentence to life in prison , state 'we be look forward to the death penalty . i'm just so disappointed in the system'1 . other victims' family deem the decision a 'mockery' , that 'justice be not done'1 . 1 goldbery , michelle . the closure myth . salon . january 21 , 2003 . accessed june 30 , 2011 5 
counterpoint : many victims' family oppose the death penalty1 . while some might take comfort in know the guilty party have be execute , others might prefer to know that the person be suffer in jail , or might not feel comfortable know that the state kill another human be on behalf of the victim . furthermore , stanford university psychiatrist david spiegel believe 'witnessing execution not only fail to provide closure but often cause symptom of acute stress . witness trauma be not far remove from experience it'2 . even if it be the case that capital punishment help the victims' family , sentence be simply not about what the victims' family want . punishment should be proportionate to the crime commit , and not the alleged preference of victims' family . 1 murder victims' families for reconciliation . accessed june 9 , 2011 . 6 2 rahka , naseem . capital punishment : muhammad and the 'closure' myth . november 1 , 2009 . accessed june 29 , 2011 . 7 
point : the state have a responsibility to protect the life of innocent citizen , and enact the death penalty may save life by reduce the rate of violent crime . the reasoning here be simple fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convince potential murderer not to carry out their act . while the prospect of life in prison may be frighten , surely death be a more daunting prospect . thus , the risk of execution can change the cost benefit calculus in the mind of murderer to be so that the act be no longer worthwhile for them1 . numerous study support the deterrent effect of the death penalty . a 1985 study by stephen k . layson at the university of north carolina show that a single execution deters 18 murder . another influential study , which look at over 3 , 054 county over two decade , far find support for the claim that murder rate tend to fall a execution rise2 . on top of this , there be way to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it be today . for instance , reduce the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase it deterrent effect in the united states1 . in short , the death penalty can and do save the life of innocent people . 1 muhlhausen , david . the death penalty deters crime and saves lives , august 28 , 2007 . accessed june 5 , 2011 . 12 2 liptak , adam . does death penalty save lives ? a new debate . the new york times . november 18 , 2007 . accessed june 9 , 2011 3 
counterpoint : there be many reason to doubt the deterrent effect of the death penalty . for one thing , many criminal may actually find the prospect of the death penalty le daunting and thus , less effective a a deterrent than spend the rest of their life suffer in jail . death by execution be generally fairly quick , while a lifetime in prison can be see a a much more intensive punishment . moreover , even if criminal prefer life in prison to the death penalty , it's not clear that a harsh punishment would effectively deter murder . heinous crime often occur in the heat of the moment , with little consideration for their legal repercussions1 . further , for a deterrent to be effective , it would have to be immediate and certain . this be not the case with the death penalty case , which often involve prolonged appeal and sometimes end in acquittals2 . finally , the empirical evidence regard the deterrence effect of the death penalty be at best mixed . many of the study that purport to show the deterrence effect be flaw , because the impact of capital punishment cannot be disentangle from other factor such a broad social trend , economic factor and demographic change in a region2 . other study have even suggest a correlation between the death penalty and high crime rate . states such a texas and oklahoma , which have very high execution rate , also have high crime rate than most state that do not have the death penalty2 . 1 amnesty international . abolish the death penalty . accessed june 5 , 2011 . 1 2 saving lives and money . the economist . march 12 , 2009 . accessed june 5 , 2011 . 8 
point : the death penalty be the only way to ensure that criminal do not escape back into society or commit further crime while in prison . while in prison , it be not uncommon for those receive life in jail sentence to commit homicide , suicide , or other crime while in jail , since there be no bad punishment they can receive1 . putting dangerous murderer in prison endangers other prisoner and the guard who must watch them . the other advantage of execution be that it prevent the possibly of an escape from prison . even the high security detention facility can have escapees2 . thus , the only way to be absolutely certain that a convict murder can no longer hurt others be to execute them . 1 murdock , deroy . a sure way to prevent prison escapes . march 30 , 2001 . accessed june 9 , 2011 10 2 davis , laura . crime and punishment : the view from a convict criminal . the independent . may 19 , 2011 . accessed june 9 , 2001 . 14 
counterpoint : escapes from prison , though sensationalized by the medium , be relatively rare occurrences1 . in 1998 , accord to the bureau of justice statistics , 6 , 530 people escape or be awol from state prison . given a total prison population of 1 , 100 , 224 state prisoner , that figure represent just over half a percent of the total prison population . on top of this , it be not impossible for people to commit further crime while on death row . those sentence to death may be even more eager to escape prior to their execution than those await life in prison , so it be not true that execution necessarily prevent further crime . 1 suellentrop , chris . how often do prisoners escape ? slate . february 1 , 2001 . 15 
point : the bad crime deserve the most severe sanction ; first degree murder involve the intentional slaughter of another human be . there be crime that be more visceral , but there be none that be more deadly . such a heinous crime can only be punish , in a just and fair manner , with the death penalty . as time put it , 'there be a zero sum symmetry to capital punishment that be simple and satisfy enough to feel like human instinct : the bad possible crime deserve no less than the bad possiblepunishment'1 . human life be sacred ; there must be a deterrent mechanism in place that ensure that those violate that fundamental precept be punish . capital punishment symbolize the value and importance place upon the maintenance of the sanctity of human life . any less sentence would fail in this duty . 1 time magazine . the death penalty : an eye for an eye . time . january 24 , 1983 . accessed june 30 , 2011 . 16 
counterpoint : there be no fairness or consistency in an eye for an eye attitude towards justice . justice should remain above the petty retributive justice that mark street or community warfare , whereby the murder of one family member justify a revenge attack against the murderers' family . furthermore , it be inconsistent with other area of the law . as new york university law professor anthony amsterdam note , 'we don't burn arsonists' houses'1 . capital punishment 'attempts to vindicate one murder by commit a second murder . and the second murder be more reprehensible because it be officially sanction and do with great ceremony in the name of u all'1 . the christian logic of an eye for an eye be undermined not merely by the pope himself , who advocate 'clemency , or pardon , for those condemn to death' , but scripture itself , which preach mercy just as vigorously a it do retribution1 . 1 time magazine . the death penalty : an eye for an eye . time . january 24 , 1983 . accessed june 30 , 2011 . 16 
point : the death penalty can help ease the problem of overcrowded prison in many country , where keep people for life in prison contributes to expensive and at time unconstitutional overcrowding1 . in 2011 , california prison overcrowding be so problematic that a district court panel order authority to release or transfer more than 33 , 000 inmate . this decision be hold up by the u . s . supreme court , which argue that the condition in the overcrowded prison be so overwhelming that they constitute cruel and unusual punishment2 . similarly , in the united kingdom two third of prison in england and wales have be deem overcrowded3 . as such , the death penalty may be preferable to life in prison since it help alleviate a pressing problem in the criminal justice system . it be well to execute those who deserve it than to be force to release dangerous offender into society because prison be overcrowd by people serve life sentence . 1sanchez , mary . california prison : cruel and unusual . the miami herald . may 30 , 2011 . accessed june 9 , 2011 . 17 2 martinez , michael . california official : we'll fix prison crowding , won't free 33 , 000 . cnn . may 24 , 2011 . accessed june 9 , 2011 . 18 3 two third of prison overcrowd . the guardian . august 25 , 2009 . accessed june 8 , 2011 19 
counterpoint : executions be rare enough that they do not have a significant impact on prison population , which be largely compose of people who would not be eligible for the death penalty . even if large number of people could be execute instead of serve prison , resource would not be save due to the expense associate with death penalty cases1 . instead of execution , there be good , more humane solution for alleviate overcrowded prison . one could increase community service requirement , build more prison , or target broad crime reduction programs2 . principally , whether or not a convict deserve to live or die should not be contingent on factor as arbitrary a the availability of prison spot in a give region . justice be about the proportionality of punishment to crime , not of prisoner to prison , so it be not fair to use crowded prison a a justification for the death penalty . 1 saving lives and money . the economist . march 12 , 2009 . accessed june 5 , 2011 . 2 death penalty information center . accessed june 8 , 2011 . 11
