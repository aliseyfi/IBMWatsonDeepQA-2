point : there be several way in which the government can make home affordable . the most obvious be to encourage the building of cheap home by ensure that the newly build home can only be sell for a small profit over the cost of construction . at the moment developer prefer to build large house or 'executive apartments' that be not affordable because they do not cost much more to build than cheap home yet sell for a much high price so there be more profit . capping the amount of profit developer could make out of the big home would change the incentive to it be well to build a lot of small cheap house . in 2004 john prescott , then deputy prime minister of the uk , challenge the construction to build home for 60 , 000 . the construction cost be ultimately high at 85 , 000 however they sell or over 200 , 000 because the developer could sell at the market price1 . 
counterpoint : this would simply be give the profit to the first buyer of the property . as such while it would help a very few first time buyer it would do little to reduce the overall market price of home . 
point : recently , grant shapps , the uk housing minister , head a meeting at the department for communities and local government in order to persuade senior executive from britain's big home builder , estate agent , and mortgage lender to engineer an age of aspiration , by help more young people to buy their first home . 1 this soar rhetoric imply the government's underlie worry that , due to the current unaffordability of home , social mobility be become more difficult . such high house price and strict lending criterion make a young person's position in society dependent on the goodwill of affluent and generous parent to help them raise a deposit . this , of course , give child bear to a high social class a lifetime advantage over peer from a poorer background . in a vicious cycle , rich child will grow up to own capital asset , include house , which they will be able to pass on a inheritance to their offspring . it be an injustice that artificial barrier to entry , such a extortionate mortgage , prevent poorer young people from enter the housing market and leave them with nothing to show for a lifetime of pay rent . 2 
counterpoint : a high house price be a just reward for property owners' labour , it be therefore the product of social mobility . existing homeowner have often work hard to secure a job with a high wage and save prudently in order to pay for a deposit on a house . often , these people have work hard to afford a house in order to provide a nest egg for their child . it seem unfair that homeowner should be force to leave a less inheritance to their heir , by reduce house price , make it hard for their own child to remain in the class to which they be bear . furthermore , in most country , those who own valuable property already pay high taxation , some of which go to program to encourage social mobility ; it seem unfair that people in this high tax bracket should be hit twice . 
point : before the financial crisis , housing price be rise fast . rather than stop this trend , government and financial institution try to adapt to and profit from it . to sustain soar house price , bank lend mortgage to people who couldn't afford them , through so called innovation , such a interest only mortgage , 100 mortgage and lending to people with poor credit history . a subsequent rise in mortgage default leave bank less willing to lend money . so , a mortgage have become more expensive , many people have be price out of the market . 1 it be unfair that first , home become so unaffordable because of bad decision by bank and , that second , the same bank be now lend mortgage to buy to let landlord , who be buy up house to rent out to young people who , otherwise , would have be first time buyer . therefore , bank should be force to lend money to young people try to enter into the property market . 
counterpoint : banks' willingness to give mortgage to people who couldn't afford home , and then to hide the risk , cause the recession . the mentality that home should be affordable to people who can't buy them in the open market be exactly the mentality that allow the us sub prime market to bring down the economy . relaxing financial legislation in an attempt to force bank to lend to first time buyer will simply cause another recession . this be because low house price will leave many homeowner in negative equity a the reduction in house price will result in bank be owe money , which the sale of the house cannot recover . 1 as negative equity be a major cause of the country's economic downturn , it be imperative that house price remain at their natural level not artificially low . 
point : to buy a house in england , you need to earn 31 , 000 per year . if you wish to buy a house in london , you need to earn 50 , 000 . these figure be much high than the average income per person . in england the average annual wage be 20 , 000 , whilst in london it be 26 , 000 . this mean that most young people will not be able to enter the housing market1 . as house price be high compare to income , most young people will not be able to buy a property unless they have a partner . this will force people into pragmatic but artificial relationship , and compel people to stay in these relationship for financial reason , and this cannot be socially ideal . 
counterpoint : instead of try to manipulate housing price , society need to re examine their view of the proper stage of life when it be necessary and advisable to purchase a house . there be no reason why friend cannot come together to sign mortgage together , such a the share to buy mortgage offer by britannia , in order to move out of their parents' house . 1 it be simply sensible to wait to raise a family until parent be a little old , have two strong income and be in an economically stable position . in this way , prudence and good financial sense will continue along the family line , lead to a more economically stable society .
