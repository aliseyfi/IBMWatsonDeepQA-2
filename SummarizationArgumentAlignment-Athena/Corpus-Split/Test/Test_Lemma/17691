point : the nation state be the fundamental building block of the international system , and be recognize a such in all international treaty and organization . states be recognize a have the right to defend themselves , and this right must extend to the possession of nuclear deterrence . often state lack the capacity to defend themselves with conventional weapon . this be particularly true of poor and small state . even wealthy , small state be susceptible to foreign attack , since their wealth cannot make up for their lack of manpower . with a nuclear deterrent , all state become equal in term of ability to do harm to one another . 1 if a large state attempt to intimidate , or even invade a small neighbour , it will be unable to effectively cow it , since the small state will have the power to grievously wind , or even destroy , the would be invader with a few well place nuclear missile . 2 for example , the russian invasion of georgia in 2008 would likely never have occur , a russia would have think twice when consider the potential loss of several of it city it would need to exchange for a small piece of georgian territory . clearly , nuclear weapon serve in many way to equalize state irrespective of size , allow them to more effectively defend themselves . furthermore , country will only use nuclear weapon in the vent of existential threat . this be why , for example , north korea have not use nuclear weapon ; for it , like all other state , survival be the order of the day , and use nuclear weapon aggressively would spell it certain destruction . countries will behave rationally with regard to the use of nuclear weapon , a they have do since their invention and initial proliferation . weapons in the hand of more people will thus not result in the great risk of their use . 
counterpoint : while state do of course have the right to defend themselves , this do not extend to the possession and use of nuclear weapon . the destructive power of nuclear weapon cannot be contain in either space or time . they have the potential to destroy all civilization and the entire ecosystem of the planet . international humanitarian law prohibit the use of weapon that be incapable of distinguish between civilian object and military target . 1 indeed , the use of nuclear weapon could well constitute a war crime or a crime against humanity . 2 just a biological and chemical weapon be ban by international treaty , so too the international community generally acknowledge the danger of nuclear proliferation , which be why so many treaty be dedicate to non proliferation . 3 it be unfortunate that nuclear weapon exist , even more so that a few country be still seek to develop them . it be well to fight this movement and to prevent their use or acquisition by terrorist and the like . it be also essential for states to fulfil their obligation under article vi of the npt to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiation lead to nuclear disarmament in all aspect under strict and effective international control . 4 nuclear weapon cannot lawfully be employ or deploy and there be a legal obligation to negotiate in good faith for , and ensure , their elimination . 5 
point : the issue discuss in international forum be largely set by nuclear power . the permanent membership of the united nations security council , for example , be compose only of nuclear power , the same state that have nuclear weapon at the end of world war ii . if all country possess nuclear weapon , they redress the imbalance with regard to international clout , at least to the extent to which military capacity shape state interaction with each other . 1 furthermore , the current world order be grossly unfair , base on the historical anachronism of the post world war ii era . the nuclear power , want to retain their position of dominance in the wake of the post war chaos , seek to entrench their position , convince small nation to sign up to non proliferation agreement and try to keep the nuclear club exclusive . it be only right , in term of fairness that state not allow themselves the ability to possess certain arm while deny that right to others . likewise , it be unfair in that it deny state , particularly those incapable of build large conventional military , the ability to defend themselves , relegate them to an inferior status on the world stage . 2 to finally level the international playing field and allow equal treatment to all member of the congress of nation , state must have the right to develop nuclear weapon . 
counterpoint : possessing nuclear weapon will do little to help small and poor nation set the agenda on the international stage . in the present age , economic power be far more significant in international and diplomatic discourse than be military power , particularly nuclear weapon power . states will not be able to have their grievance more rapidly address in the united nations or elsewhere , since they will be unable to use nuclear weapon in an aggressive context a that would seriously threaten their own survival . possessing nuclear weapon may at best provide some security against neighbour state , but it create the great threat of accidental or unintended use or of nuclear weapon fall into the hand of terrorist and rogue state . 
point : nuclear weapon create stability , describe in the doctrine of mutually assured destruction mad . countries with nuclear weapon have no incentive to engage in open military conflict with one another ; all recognize that they will suffer destruction if they choose the path of war . 1 if country have nuclear weapon , fight simply become too costly . this serve to defuse conflict , and reduce the likelihood of the outbreak of war . for example , the conflict between india and pakistan be defuse by the acquisition of nuclear weapon by both side . before they obtain nuclear weapon , they fight three war that claim million of life . relations between the two state , while still far from cordial , have never descend into open war . the defusing of the immediate tension of war , have give the chance for potential dialogue . 2 a similar dynamic have be play out a number of time in the past , and a of yet there have never be a war between two nuclear power . when state have nuclear weapon they cannot fight , make the world a more peaceful place . 
counterpoint : the nuclear peace theory only hold when all nuclear arm state behave rationally . this cannot be guarantee , a rogue state exist whose leader may not be so rational , and whose government may not be capable of check the power of individual , erratic tyrant . also , international conflict might well be exacerbate in the event that terrorists or other dissident acquire nuclear weapon or dirty bomb , lead to great fear that nuclear weapon will be use . a good situation be one in which nuclear weapon be reduce and ultimately eliminate , rather than increase in number . furthermore , mad can break down in some case , when weapon delivery system be improve . for example , pakistan s military have develop miniaturize nuclear warhead for use against tank and other hard target on the indian border , that will leave little nuclear fallout and thus be more likely to be employ in the event of a border skirmish . this development could well cause escalation in future conflict . 1 in addition to the risk of such small weapon be the risk of pre emptive nuclear strike , a some country with nuclear weapon might lack second strike capability . clearly , possession of nuclear weapon will not guarantee peace , and if war do occur , it will be far more ghastly than any conventional war . 
point : when nuclear deterrence be an acknowledged right of state , they will necessarily be less conceal of their capability , a the deterrent effect work only because it be visible and widely know . knowledge of state nuclear capability allow great regulation and cooperation in development of nuclear program from developed country with more advanced nuclear program . 1 developed country can help construct and maintain the nuclear weapon of other country , help to guarantee the safety protocol of country program be suitably robust . this will cause a diminution in clandestine nuclear weapon program , and will reduce the chance of weapon grade material fall into the hand of terrorist . thus , great openness and freedom in the development of nuclear weapon will increase the security of nuclear stockpile . 
counterpoint : it be very unlikely that many state will invite their neighbour to help them in the development of their weapon and in secure them , a do so would open the risk to sabotage and would disclose potential weakness in their defence . furthermore , terrorist will not be substantially deter by great openness in weapon development , a there will be more potential supplier of weapon .
