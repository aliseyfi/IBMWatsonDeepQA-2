point : the internet have become a major source of information for many people . however , online information have usually not go through the same check a newspaper article , book or factual television programming . there be a high risk that some of the fact or quotation from a particular source in an article be false . whereas newspaper might lose customer if people find out they have be sell lie , a blog and other online content can be easily create and upload as well as just a quickly be delete . if people base their opinion on the information they find online , they could well be base their opinion on false information . take for example the 2006 conspiracy film loose change which have have million of view . a report from the thinktank demos in a report title truth , lies and the internet : a report into young people s digital fluency 1 state that the film contain a . . . litnay of error , misattributions , vague insinuation , subtle misquote , and outright falsehood . . . since the internet give equal space to material of greatly vary quality , the degree to which the internet can be view a be a total force for good be draw into question . if an informed society be an empowered society it therefore stand to reason that a misinformed society be disempowered society . 
counterpoint : the internet give million of people access to information they would not otherwise have have , which be a huge benefit . people who read the news , offline or online , be not inherently dupable , they like all people do not simply accept message they be , to vary degree , critical of what they read and not simply passive . when people spend a lot of time read online content they can differentiate between blogger who be untrustworthy or extremely bias from blogger who carefully refer to legitimate source . the problem of bad information in news making be not unique to the internet ; there be lot of trashy magazine and poorly research news content in traditional print channel of communication a well . we learn in formal education to double check our source and not believe everything we read , and we can apply that skill while surf the internet . 
point : everyone s privacy can be greatly harm by the internet . some website store information . some ask u to fill in information which can be sell to other site for commercial purpose . as the internet gain more and more user the temptation for criminal to gain our private information become great . hackers can hide their true location when engage in illegal activity online , so the likelihood of their be bring to justice be low . whenever people post something online , it become almost impossible to erase , and with the proliferation of social network post personal information online be become second nature , this be a dangerous precedent . take for example the posting of our location online via geotagging , this for many be an action which doesn t take much consideration , however , to demonstrate the danger of this designer barry borsoom setup the website pleaserobme . com which would grab geocaching data and tell people when a person s house be potentially empty . 1 
counterpoint : privacy online be a big concern , but an educated citizen can navigate the internet in a safe and sensible manner with minimal privacy issue , although a with be offline a the threat of crime can never be entirely eliminate . when we go online no one force the user to share private information , it be volunteer by the user in exchange for a free service , it be often a small price to pay for the service that can be receive in return , such a free e mail or free webspace . of course privacy can be infringe in other way , by unlawful access to personal file for example , but if protection such a firewall be setup and user be careful about what they download privacy online can be easily maintain . it be mislead to say we be sleep walk into a big brother existence , it give in impression that the effect the internet be have on society be conspiratorial , this be clearly not the case , people like the way the internet can bring people all over the world together . privacy be no more of a problem online than privacy be in the offline world , the issue be be overstate by the proposition . 
point : the ability for anyone to be able to publish anything online without barrier result in a large amount of information which could not only be incorrect but could also be criminal , offensive or discriminatory if it be available to the general public . this sort of information would not usually be widely publish via offline channel , but with the advent of the internet it be very easily accessible by anyone like never before , and this be a dangerous president . a cavalcade of propaganda from extremist group such a religious zealot or neo nazis for example can be access by anyone around the world . this be dangerous a vulnerable people could easily be take in and exploit if the discover this material . it be quite often find that lone wolf terrorist , for example , have get their information and inspiration from the internet . garry reid , deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and combating terrorism in the usa state that enabled by 21st century technology , extremist have optimize the use of internet chat room , web sit and e mail chain to spread their virulent message and reach a global audience of potential recruit . 1 but it be not only terrorist who be utilize the internet at a detriment to society . various report have link a sharp rise in paedophilia with the growth of the internet 2 a it be an easy and often anonymous way to share such material with the world . the ability for anyone to publish anything online could clearly do considerable harm to society , which would have otherwise be much less prevalent and easy to control and regulate . 
counterpoint : freedom of information should mean freedom of all type of information , even if it be extreme propaganda from fringe group such a neo nazis or al qaeda . the public must be trust to be able to make it own decision on the value of such text . what be great about the internet be that point of view that would not necessarily get much publicity in traditional medium can be air and discuss online , from serious issue such a capital punishment to less serious one like alien . of course one of the downfall of such freedom be that illegal content such a child pornography can be make available in a way which it could not have before , but highlight this issue be not entirely fair a it be greatly outweigh by the information available online that be perfectly fine and legal . this do not of course excuse the publication of such image . it be , however , a slight misnomer to suggest that the internet be entirely free from the restraint of law . in issue of legality , government can take action : they can either trace the origin of the image or force web space provider and isps internet service providers to take down the content . on the whole , have ready access to such a large amount of information , and be able to freely add and discuss it , be beneficial to society , because it be both liberate and educational .
