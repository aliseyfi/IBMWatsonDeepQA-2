point : homework have little educational worth and add nothing to the time spend in school . some school and some country don't bother with homework at all , and their result do not seem to suffer from it . studies show that homework add nothing to standardise test score for primary elementary pupil . as alfie kohn note , no study have ever find a link between homework and good test result in elementary school , and there be no reason to believe it be necessary in high school . 1 international comparison of old student have find no positive relationship between the amount of homework set and average test score student in japan and denmark get little homework but score very well on test . 2 if anything , country with more homework get bad result ! 
counterpoint : homework have a lot of educational value , the reason it have not show this be because teacher do not set the right kind of homework or they set the wrong amount of it . some teacher believe homework be for review material , others think it be well for learn new concept . the result be 'confusion for students' . 1 if the homework be consistent however , and relate specifically to what be learn in the classroom , it would have a great deal of educational value by help them remember their lesson and increase students' confidence in how much they be learn . 
point : irrespective of homework's educational value , mark it take up much of teachers' time . australian teacher have complain that 'homework mark can result in four extra hour of work a day and they be rarely reward for their effort' . 1 this leave teacher tire and with little time to prepare effective , inspiring lesson . if the lesson aren't to the standard they should be , the point of homework be lose a the student have little to practise in the first place . the heavy workload also put young graduate off become teacher , and so reduce the talent pool from which school can recruit . 
counterpoint : teachers accept that mark student work be an important part of their job . well plan homework should not take so long to mark that the rest of their job suffers , and it can inform their understanding of their student , help them design new activity to engage and stretch them . as for recruitment , although teacher do often work in the evening , they be not alone in this and they get long holiday to compensate . 
point : homework take a lot of time up . in america , they encourage the '10 minute rule' , 10 minute homework for every grade , mean that high school student be all do more than an hour's worth of homework each night . 1 being young be not just about do school work every night . it should also about be physically active , explore the environment through play , do creative thing like music and art , and play a part in the community . it be also important for young people to build bond with others , especially family and friend , but homework often squeeze the time available for all these thing . 
counterpoint : homework have not prevent student do other activity ; it take very little time to complete . recent american survey find that most student in the usa spend no more than an hour a night on homework . that suggest there do not seem to be a terrible problem with the amount be set . furthermore , british study have show that 'more child be engage in sport or cultural activities' than ever before . 1 as such , there be no clear evidence to suggest that student be stick at home do their homework instead of do other activity . in addition , concern over how busy child be suggest that parent need to help their child set priority so that homework do not take a back seat to school work . 
point : homework put student off learn . studies have show that many child find do homework very stressful , boring and tiring . often teacher underestimate how long a task will take , or set an unrealistic deadline . sometimes because a teacher have not explain something new well in class , the homework task be impossible . so child end up pay with their free time for the failing of their teacher . they also suffer punishment if work be do badly or late . after year of bad homework experience , it be no wonder that many child come to dislike education and switch off , or drop out too early . teachers in britain fear that poor child , because they lack the support to do their homework , will be turn off school 1 . 
counterpoint : if homework put student off learn , then it have be badly plan by the teacher . as linda darling hammond , a professor of education note , 'many teacher lack the skill to design homework assignment that help kid learn and don't turn them off to learning' . 1 the best homework task engage and stretch student , encourage them to think for themselves and follow through idea which interest them . over time , well plan homework can help student develop good habit , such a read for pleasure or creative writing . the research however suggest that homework be not in fact put student off learn . rather study in britain indicate that 'most child be happy and most be achieve a high level than before' . 2 homework cannot be blame for a problem that do not exist . poor child may indeed lack support to do their homework , but this just mean that school need to do more to provide the help they need . 
point : many government make their school give student a national test a test take by all student of the same age . after the test , they compare school and punish the school and teacher whose student do badly . because school and teacher be therefore scar about their student do poorly , they give them more homework , not in the hope they learn more but simply to do good on the test . 1 as such , homework be not design to help the student , just their teacher and school who want them to 'win' the test and make them look good , not learn for the students' own benefit . 
counterpoint : setting homework with the intention of encouraging student to do well at test be beneficial to student as much a it be to teacher and school . national test be a way of assess whether student be at the level they should be , if they do well on the test , that be a good thing . therefore , a 'win' for the teacher and school be also a great deal of learn for the student , the two need not be separate . 
point : in many country public school require regular school inspection to ensure student be receive a relatively equal level of education . in britain for example , ofsted be a public body that exist specifically to inspect public school . 1 a ban on homework would thus not require a level of trust between the state and individual school principal , for state inspector could very quickly work out whether homework be be give out by ask the child themselves . children , who don't like homework at the best of time , would not lie . 
counterpoint : many state do not in fact have a structured school inspection system that could enforce such a ban . the united states , for example , have one of the large student body in the world but the state do not have a formal inspection system that could enforce a ban on homework . therefore any ban would only prove a recommendation at best , and could not possibly hope to be enforce .
