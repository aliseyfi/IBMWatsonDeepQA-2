point : the primary justification for democracy promotion be the democratic peace theory . the theory of the democratic peace go back to immanuel kant's essay 'perpetual peace' , which he publish in 17951 ; perpetual peace refers to a state of affair where peace be permanently establish over a certain area , a the roman and british empires attempt to do during their respective period of dominance in history . kant's theory be that the majority of people would never go to war , unless in self defence2 . democracies tend not to go to war as often a other country because their military be more directly under civilian control . authoritarian government or those heavily underpin by their respective army , by contrast , have no such barrier to whimsical invasion of other country nor the use of the national army to suppress their own people in a bid to solidify power . communist north korea be just one example of a country whose foreign policy be extremely aggressive a a direct result of it political inclinations3 . therefore if all country be democracy there would be no war a there would be no aggressor . given the peaceful nature of democratic state , it be clearly in the interest of the usa to promote democratic change worldwide . 
counterpoint : the imposition of a foreign or alien political theory be often view in the recipient country a an unwarranted invasion , whether enforce militarily or not . the globalisation of western culture be view by many a erode traditional value and this often foster resentment and can lead to widespread support of terrorism1 . this do not have the effect of worldwide peace , and again a more indirect western foreign policy may prevent strike of retribution by disaffected traditionalist . 
point : democracy be a universal value which know no cultural boundary . the universal declaration of human rights state that everyone be entitle to all the right and freedom set forth in this declaration , without distinction of any kind , such a race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status 1 . it be a fallacy to suggest that we should excuse country from this clause because their culture seem to preach otherwise . the principle of democracy be something that everyone be entitle to simply because they be right and fair . democracy should not be reserve a a privilege for those who happen to be bear in a culture that already support it ; we must endeavour to make all country believe in the veracity of this declaration . 
counterpoint : some theorist suggest that democracy be a unique method of governance which reflect uniquely western and european value . afghanistan be a prime example of this1 . the international community foot the bill for the 2009 presidential election , worth hundred of million of dollar ; however , accord to the afghanistan independent election commission iec , only about one third of registered voter visit the poll , approximately 5 million of the roughly 15 million afghans who registered2 . a 2010 national survey conduct by the asia foundation show that when face with social or economic problem , or in need of dispute resolution or service , the vast majority of afghan respondent approach a non government entity , either the village shura or jirga , or the malik or mullah3 . culturally a more unitary system of governance suit the need of the country well ; to force western democratic value on other country through expansive democracy promotion be ultimately to interfere with their right to self determination and self government . 
point : democracy be good for the worldwide economy , a it value of openness and accountability promote the rule of law and good governance in the people's interest . the threat that the electorate will not re elect them at the next election force government to adopt social and economic policy which will make their citizen rich and more secure . in practice this mean create open market friendly to inward investment and eager for trade , while rein in corruption , military spending and aggressive foreign policy . china be a good example here . of course it be by no mean democratic , but in order to continue it economic boom it have over the last ten year have to open up it business practice to the world . integration into the world economy for example , join the wto have lead to great transparency1 . because encourage such policy be clearly in the economic interest of all current democracy , they should actively seek to promote democracy abroad a the best way to achieve wealth . 
counterpoint : the economic benefit of democracy be dubious , despite the attractiveness of the theoretical link between free election and prosperity . many would argue that the causation run the other way , argue that a an economy develop the rise middle class seek to protect their property and business investment by push for accountable government which will abide by the rule of law : thus democracy do not need to be promote politically , it should emerge naturally from economic growth . see china again politics come from economics , not the other way round . while integration into the global trading community might make country less inclined to violence for fear of the economic damage they might do to themselves , there be plenty of example of relatively prosperous country use their wealth to fund military expansion and often war . britain and germany in the year before 1914 spring to mind here , a do iraq in 1990 . none of this suggest that democracy would be wise to prioritise democratization in it foreign policy . 
point : everyone have the right to life , liberty and security of person 1 , everyone have the right to freedom of opinion and expression 2 and everyone have the right to take part in the government of his country , directly or through freely choose representative 3 be three of the most fundamental tenet of democratic society . the vote ensure that public expression can take place peacefully , instead of violently . free speech provide a legitimate avenue through which to address the government and ease tension in society that could potentially turn violent . for these reason , democracy tend not to suppress their people use violence , a in the case of the tiananmen square incident in communist china4 or with the tulip revolution in authoritarian kyrgystan5 . in fact , democracy tend to have constitution , which ensure the government cannot violently suppress peaceful dissent , and must always honour the belief of the majority of it people . everyone should have a right to live without fear of suppression and with the ability to voice their opinion and belief . because such value be write deep within the heart of the democracy , our government should seek to export them wherever possible abroad . if western democracy be to live up to their call a shin beacon for all mankind , it should seek to promote democratization a the best mean of improve human well be around the world . 
counterpoint : those who be against democracy promotion frame the discussion differently . while democracy do bring liberalization , this can provide a platform for extremist political or religious view which be suppress under more authoritarian regime . also , impose a democracy risk allow leader whose political campaign be subsidise or support by terrorist into power , a appear to have happen with hamas in the palestinian territories1 . consequently it be sometimes in the national interest of democracy to support regime who share a commitment to the war against terror e . g . pakistan or ethiopia , even if these be less than fully democratic , rather than run the risk of 'liberating' a country which may well turn on them .
