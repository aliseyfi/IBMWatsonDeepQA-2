point : the south korean government issue occasional exemption to athlete who have win an olympic gold medal or achieve a similar feat . if we accept that the law ought to be consistent then there be no reason why entertainer should not be proffer the same opportunity . both profession tend to favour the young and the requirement that military service need to be complete before the age of thirty mean that either career would be interrupt just at the point when the individual be likely to be at the height of their skill . 
counterpoint : celebrities , unlike athlete , work for themselves whereas athlete represent the country . military service mean represent the nation to the rest of the world a do be an athlete , that s the reason for the exemption , not simply a matter of celebrity . 
point : the career path of celebrity be unusual in that it accrete over time on the basis of the performer stand in the public mind . unlike other profession this do not lend itself to take two year out of the limelight , especially year when fame be come to it height . 
counterpoint : anyone set out on such a career be aware of the legal requirement to undertake service in the armed force . there be absolutely nothing to stop them do it before they start their career . there be plenty of job where it be inconvenient to have to take an extended break . anything relate to technology or research , for example , where there be a need to keep up to date with the late development in the field be fairly unforgiving of such a break and so people build their career around it , know that at some point they will be out of the loop for 24 month or so . 
point : for most profession , get military service out of the way early in one s career make sense . nobody would suggest that member of other profession should be expect to interrupt it when they be at the height of their profession . in reality for most people this would be when they be in their fifty . for profession like act and music this tend to be the late twenty and early thirty . indeed , for pop singer in particular their career be likely to be over when they be 35 . 
counterpoint : again , there be nothing to stop celebrity do their military service before they start perform but , even be that not the case , military service be not something that be undertaken because it be convenient or easy but rather something that be do because it be necessary . the country be at risk of invasion , it be still technically at war with the north and in the last kim jong il have become increasingly erratic .
