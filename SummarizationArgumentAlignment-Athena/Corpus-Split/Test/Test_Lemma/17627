point : if sanction be effective , their use be justified because they ultimately achieve a desired outcome . they cause financial pain to leader pressure them to reform . long term sanction on south africa be an effective policy . they cause the living standard in the country to deteriorate , however this ultimately lead to the right amount of pressure on the government for apartheid to be ended1 . economic restriction be first place on south africa in 1963 and be ultimately lift after the end of apartheid almost 30 year later . nelson mandela himself have state that sanction play a role in force the south african government to end apartheid2 . the success of sanction in the past have prevent the international community from take military action against certain state . due to prior success in south africa , sanction be an appropriate tool to push country towards reform while prevent military escalation . 1 foer , franklin 1996 , economic sanctions , slate . com , , accessed june 7 , 2011 . 3 2 laverty , alexander 2007 , impact of economic and political sanctions on apartheid , the africa file , accessed june 10 , 2011 . 13 
counterpoint : sanctions have also fail in the long term . a recent study find that sanction be use 116 time between 1914 and 1990 , and after 1973 be only effective 24 of the time1 . south africa be not an appropriate example because the us and eu have a cooperative relationship with the country prior to sanction therefore increase the impact the trade restriction have . sanctions be now mostly use against isolated country , like north korea and myanmar , who do not have a close relationship with international actor , and for whom cut off trade be not such a detrimental loss . since the country sanction be currently be use against do not fit the profile of south africa , sanction be ineffective and success in south africa be irrelevant . 1 gilboy , george 2008 , political and social reform in china : alive and walking , washington quarterly , accessed june 10 , 2011 . 9 
point : arms embargo be a type of sanction that specifically target type of weapon . if a country be be particularly violent towards it people or at risk of civil war , arm embargo can be use to decrease the weapon available to the government or the people . in 1993 1994 an arm embargo be place on haiti by the united nations after a military coup by the group fadh the forces armarm√©es d haiti . forces be estimate to shrink from 6000 to 1000 by the time the us invade in 1994 thanks to the arm embargo 1 . preventing government from attain weapon can be the most effective way of stop government violence . if they don t have weapon to arm their military , civil war and genocide become more difficult to perpetrate . arms embargo have be successful and when use in conjunction with other policy action can be an effective way of address fear of civil war , ethnic cleansing , government violence , and coup . 
counterpoint : because of the size of the global community , and ease of communication and transport , most country can still attain necessary weapon and tool . as the world have globalize and information can be pass , attain , and hidden , with the click of a button , arm embargo be much more difficult to maintain . the un place an arm embargo on the sudan due to fear of ethnic cleanse carry out by the janjaweed , yet it be report that there be violation of the embargo on all side of the conflict . in fact , there be accusation back up by pictorial evidence that even after the arm embargo be put into place , china and russia , both member of the un security council , be sell weapon to the country1 . arms embargo often fall short of their goal . 1 bbc 2007 , china , russia deny weapon breach , accessed june 10 , 2011 . 15 
point : sanctions send a strong message to the people of a country that the western world be on their side and will not just remain compliant by deal with an oppressive regime a if it have do nothing wrong . part of what encourage people to stand up for their civil liberty be a feeling of support against their regime from outside actor . true reform need to come from pressure within and outside of the state a it do in south africa . the only way to incentivize internal pressure be by express support for civilian movement . in the case of the repressive government in myanmar , the lifting of sanction would be view a a betrayal by the myanmarese and would reverse any progress that sanction have help to achieve . the leader of the opposition movement , aung san suu kyi , in myanmar have call for a continuation of sanction , and in an act of support the us have complied1 . therefore sanction can be an important signal of support to a country's people , which make them more likely to stand up to their government and create the necessary internal pressure for reform . 1 colvin , jake and cox , simon 2007 , are economic sanctions good foreign policy ? , council on foreign relations , accessed june 10 , 2011 . 16 
counterpoint : sanctions often hurt the people more than they hurt the regime , render it difficult to discern whether the state s impose sanction truly care about the citizen involve or their own self interest . inflicting the pain of poverty and starvation obviously do not show solidarity , but instead can crush any opposition movement in the country . if people be worried about feed themselves they be less likely to take action against their government . additionally , sanction be not the only form of support the people of a country . in the most recent arab spring , the us do not support protester solely through sanction , but instead publicly call for reforms1 . drawing international attention to certain issue can also be an effective mean of take action . sanctions be therefore not a necessary or effective way of show support . 1 sharp , jeb 2011 , president obama calls for middle east reform , pri's the world , access june 10 , 2011 . 17 
point : most diplomatic negotiation occur behind closed door , and it have be hypothesize that if sanction be go to be effective it be the threat of the sanction that force the country to concede , not the sanction themselves1 . that say , if sanction be never follow through , the threat would be meaningless . the use of sanction build up the fear of sanction . this fear can bend country towards the will of the sanction nation . to maintain the threat of sanction a a viable negotiating tool , sanction need to be implement on occasion to prevent sanction from become an empty , meaningless threat . 1 colvin , jake and cox , simon 2007 , are economic sanctions good foreign policy ? , council on foreign relations , accessed june 10 , 2011 . 16 
counterpoint : recent sanction failure can make sanction a less viable threat . seeing that myanmar , iran and north korea have successfully be able to deflect the pain and pressure of sanction onto their people1 , the threat of sanction becomes less powerful because it be less likely to spell the end of a regime2 . the failure of sanction , not the infrequent use , make them useless . 1 the economist 2011 , an aye for sanction , accessed june 10 , 2011 . 23 2 noland , marcus 2009 , the non impact of un sanctions on north korea , the national bureau of asian research , accessed june 10 , 2011 . 1
