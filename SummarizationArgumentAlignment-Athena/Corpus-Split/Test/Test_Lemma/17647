point : a free market give the power to the people to choose and decide what product and service should be offer to them . if many people want the same thing the demand will be high and it will be profitable to offer them on the market since it will sell , therefore the people be in command of what product be be offer to them through their own want . the market be thus decide upon what people need and therefore there will be no excess product or service offer e . g . let u presume that many people want to see high quality basketball , a person like michael jordan who have a talent for basketball and have hone his basketball skill would in this case be much in demand . people be ready to pay for the service he offer excellent basketball and consequently his high wage will be justify . on the other hand a mediocre basketball player would not be pay at all since there be no demand to see mediocre basketball , his service do not have an attraction on the market and will thus be eliminated1 2 . this be all part of what could be call a dynamic capitalist system which value individuality hone your basketball skill , reward ability have basketball skill and risk take risk that you will succeed with it . 
counterpoint : often when consumer buy thing they might ostensibly believe that they have a choice , when in reality they do not , since they be present with several option ; i could e . g . either watch this blockbuster movie or that blockbuster movie on the cinema . however , there be no option to watch anything else than a blockbuster movie and consequently there be no real choice offer . capitalism have already decide what be go to be produce and the consumer be leave with nothing else than purchase whatever be provide . another example could be that there might be a whole range of food option in the supermarket , but the good food be expensive and therefore the people with less income end up eat unhealthy food since they cannot afford the good food , therefore in practice there be no real choice since one of the option be not available for the people with less income because it be too expensive1 . an additional counterargument might also be to question the validity that a product service's price should be determine by the pure fancy of the market , be it really justifiable that michael jordan earn much more than e . g . a nurse ? the nurse provide a service which save life while michael jordan only supply entertainment , even if it be only michael jordan who can play a certain kind of high quality basketball and many more people be qualified nurse , it do not justify at all the wage difference between the two2 . 
point : the right to own property be central to man's existence since it ensure him of his independence of survival . it provide a mean to sustain himself without rely on others inasmuch a he have control over a property and can make a living from it . however in order to acquire property the person must gain it from his own labour , if he take the fruit of someone else's labour without consent that would be plain stealth . however , this be not the only requirement which must be fulfil in order to gain property : imagine a scenario where i pour out tomato juice into the ocean , i have mix my own labour with nature and make an own creation , but could it be say that the ocean be my property ? most people would certainly say no and therefore one of the following two proviso must also be meet before one can fully acquire property : 1 . it do not impact on others chance of survival comfort of life2 . leaves the others good off than before . let u presume that we have a wasteland which generate very little harvest since it be uncultivated . if i privatise and cultivate a bit of this land it will generate more harvest since i have put work effort in it . presuming that the privatisation do not leave the others bad off than before e . g . there be plenty of other wasteland they can cultivate on their own and do thus not harm anyone else's opportunity chance to cultivate their own land , privatisation be allow for the individual good . alternately , others be well off if they do not have the skill to cultivate land themselves and can lease their labour work on my privatized land , they would win on the deal since the wage i pay them would be good than what they would have gain on their own1 2 . 
counterpoint : under capitalism property be privatise under the presumption that it will not harm anyone or even that it will benefit everyone . this be not the case and what actually take place be that property becomes concentrate into the hand of a relatively few well off people leave the rest more or less without property . the capitalist's bargaining position be far superior in comparison to the worker's since he be a capitalist and he can use it a an advantage in order to concentrate wealth for himself . if the capitalist have everything and the worker nothing it leave the worker with nothing more than the mercy of the rich for work , charity , etc . even if the capitalist offer the worker a salary on which he can survive in comparison to unemployment a salary on which he can survive make him good off' it be a forced contract out of necessity from the worker's part1 2 . consequently private ownership be by no mean on par with the possibility of own good in common and be thus contradictory to the capitalist premise of not harm others3 . capitalism make the majority more dependent on a minority than they would have be if property be share . 
point : the western democratic capitalist system protect individual's right and liberty through freedom from of interference by other people . mature adult citizen be believe to have the capacity to choose what kind of life they want to lead and create their own future without paternalistic coercion from the state berlin , 1958 . the capitalist society's ideal could perhaps be best exemplify with the american dream where everyone have an initial equal opportunity to reach their full potential , each individual be choose their own path free from external coercion , . james truslow adams define the american dream a the following in 1931 life should be good and rich and fuller for everyone , with opportunity for each accord to ability or achievement 1 . the current president of united stated barack obama be a typical example of a person who have achieve the american dream . barack obama do not start his life with a traditional fortunate circumstance previous president have enjoy e . g . george bush . nevertheless he succeed in transcend his social class , his race etc . and become the president of united states2 . thus capitalism provide everyone with a fair chance to reach great achievement in their life if they seize the opportunity . 
counterpoint : capitalists often disregard the fact that people , although be individual , also be form by their social circumstance 1 2 . people's class belonging , sexuality , sex , nationality , education etc . have a major impact on people's opportunity ; there might be case of individual achieve the american dream like barack obama despite their social background , however this be not applicable to the majority of people . in capitalism the people with the most opportunity be usually the people who have the most capital , take the example of university student : university in many country such a the united states and united kingdom charge student high tuition fee , if one be not wealthy enough to pay for these fee the likelihood to continue into further education be much low if a loan be provide one would have to risk to be indebted for a long period of one's life , or not have the opportunity to study at university at all 3 . this can by no mean be call an equal opportunity for everyone . it be not enough to provide opportunity ; people must also be in a position to grab them . 
point : the strong motivational force a human be can feel towards work be a potential reward for their effort , therefore those who work hard and contribute most to society should justly also gain the most in form of increased wealth e . g . private property . when work be uncouple from reward or when an artificial safety net provide a high standard of living for those who do not work , society a a whole suffers . if those who work will benefit equally a the one who do not there will be no reason to work and the overall productivity will be lower , which be bad for society . incentives be therefore necessary since it increase the overall standard for the whole society in form of material wealth , the fact that individual be drive to succeed and earn what be rightfully theirs be thus in all our interest . with an overall high productivity even the bad off may benefit more than they would have if the productivity have be low e . g . through charity etc . 1 2 3 4 
counterpoint : according to karl marx work should not be regard as just a mean to achieve a reward in the form of profit , work should i be direct to the need of their fellow , ii be an enjoyable , meaningful activity which develop human capability . in the capitalist system labour becomes distorted e . g . industrial work tends to be monotonous and dull without any enjoyment at all . people be more or less coerced to work for their survival and accept even the most horrific work condition ; work be only perform on the capitalist's terms1 2 . if worker do not have to fight for their survival and labour be direct to the meaningful activity of help others instead of profit making for capitalist , incentive in the form of profit would be without value . the want to share wealth and material amongst the community be inscribe in the human essence and constitutes meaningful activity . it be not merely possible
