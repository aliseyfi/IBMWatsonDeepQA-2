point : there be a number of technological development that have make the use of conventional weapon ineffective in combat certain threat . for example , some bunker be bury so deeply underground that conventional bomb cannot penetrate them . weapons such a the robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep , currently in development in the united states , would be able to penetrate such bunker , while leave no more surface damage than a conventional bomb1 . deployment of a weapon such a the rnep might prove necessary in order to stop proliferation of nuclear weapon in rogue state , a for example , iran have build extremely tough bunker for the purpose of nuclear testing and storage of weapon of mass destruction . blocking the development of necessary tactical nuclear technology actually raise the chance of these dangerous state obtain nuclear weapon . another instance of tactical nuclear device prove useful be in the destruction of clandestine biological and chemical weapon factory . were such facility destroy by conventional bombing , some of the material be manufacture could easily leak into neighbour population area , lead to increase casualty . clearly , in light of these defense innovation , tactical nuclear weapon be an essential addition to a nuclear power's arsenal . 1 reynolds , paul . 2003 . mini nukes on us agenda . bbc news . 2 
counterpoint : conventional weapon be perfectly capable of deal with the issue and conflict for which tactical nuclear weapon be design , and be less risky to employ . the prediction by the united states government that the rnep would produce little fallout , for example , appear unfounded . on the contrary , the weapon would likely scatter deadly nuclear fallout for mile around a target site , cause terrible destruction and collateral damage1 . furthermore , development in conventional weapon can serve the same purpose , if with slightly great difficulty . new super bunker buster bomb be in development in the united states that do not carry a nuclear payload , and fuel air bomb can , with their wide incendiary range , destroy factory and incinerate any hazardous material quite effectively . new nuclear weapon be not necessary for the tactical concern of the future . 1 union of concerned scientists . 2005 . robust nuclear earth penetrator . 1 
point : research and development into tactical nuclear weapon be essential for country to maintain their technological edge in the field of nuclear science . the united states have long enjoy technological dominance in the field of nuclear weaponry . however , in recent year china and russia have begin to pour effort into develop ever small nuclear weapon for tactical deployment . if the united states and the other nuclear power wish to maintain their position within the nuclear tech order , they must begin invest far in development of similar miniaturize nuclear device . research into the design and construction of mini nuke provide a number of benefit beyond the tactical flexibility confer by such weapon . first , develop mini nuke put designer and scientist in the west on the same intellectual page a those seek to devise nuclear weapon suitable for use in terrorist attack , such a so called suitcase nukes1 . by learn how to build such weapon scientist will be able to devise mean of counteract them should an enemy attempt to employ them in an attack . furthermore , the miniaturization of nuclear weapon have application in other nuclear technology such a in the design and manufacture of small nuclear power facility . military technology always find an outlet in civilian use . such be case with cold war technological endeavor , such a the space race , which yield everything from superior computer processor to ballpoint pen . clearly , the public will in many way reap the boon arise from the development of small tactical nuclear weapon . 1 jervis , robert . 2001 . weapons without purpose ? nuclear strategy in the post cold war era . foreign affairs . 3 
counterpoint : countries can develop their nuclear relate technology without the need to direct effort to the construction of extremely dangerous , miniature nuclear weapon . rather , if superior technology be desire , the resource exist in western country to do most research without even touch nuclear material , be able to do much of the research by mean of computer . dominance in nuclear engineering do not require the creation of such weapon . it be well to direct research toward peaceful application of nuclear technology . 
point : for deterrence to function , rogue state and other international actor with nuclear capability , such a north korea , must believe that their would be target will retaliate in kind if attack , tactical nuclear weapon provide a middle option . given that these rogue state would likely only have access to low yield nuclear weapon , it be unlikely that they would be able to launch a nuclear attack capable of more than damage a western city . furthermore , the relative difficulty of develop deliverable nuclear weapon mean that rogue nation be increasingly look toward the acquisition and development of alternative weapon of mass destruction , such a chemical , biological , and radiological weapon . were the united states , or another nuclear power , to be attack by any of these weapon , it be unlikely that it , or the international community would consider the deployment of a strategic nuclear strike in retaliation to be justify . the response would certainly be disproportionately large , a strategic nuclear missile can easily level city , even with the small possible payload . this mean that in order to maintain effective deterrence , nuclear power must shift from the paradigm lay out by the doctrine of mutually assured destruction to a flexible response doctrine , in which country deploy arsenal of much small , tactical nuclear weapon that their enemy honestly believe they will use if provoke . by equip themselves with a range of weapon , so a to be able to scale response appropriately , nuclear arm country be far likelier to deter potential aggressor in future 1 . pakistan's military serf a an example of such tactical nuclear capability ready for action ; it army be arm with an arsenal of mini nuke that can be use to destroy whole tank formation , with little radioactive fallout disperse beyond the battlefield . these weapon serve to redress the balance between pakistani and indian conventional military capacity . as pakistan be woefully outnumber and outgunned in conventional weapon , it tactical nuclear arsenal can deliver devastating damage to massed indian army formation , prevent any potential invasion2 . clearly , tactical nuclear weapon be useful weapon in a country arsenal , prepare it to be more flexible in it application of nuclear force . 1 reynolds , paul . 2003 . mini nukes on us agenda . bbc news . 2 2the 6 economist . 2011 . a rivalry that threatens the world . the economist . 6 
counterpoint : all rogue state that might attack the united states or other western country would likely be unable to withstand a conventional military attack from one of them . for this reason , any retaliation to a crude nuclear attack from a rogue state would more likely , and more justifiably , incur retaliation by conventional military force . with it massive conventional bomb , air and sea dominance , and tactical superiority , the united states , for example would be good serve by respond to nuclear aggression with overwhelming conventional firepower . rather than validate nuclear retaliation , and thus open the door to similar response in the future , it be well to respond to such situation with conventional power . 
point : development and deployment of tactical nuclear weapon can be view a a suitable replacement for the thousand of strategic nuclear missile and launcher be decommission a part of the recently ratify new start between russia and the united states , which represent a major step toward non proliferation of strategic nuclear weapon . the treaty exempt tactical nuclear weapon by omit them from the language of the treaty , include a yet undeveloped miniature warhead , a both the united states and russia have come to see the possession and deployment of tactical nuclear weapon a key to their national security . replacing large number of strategic nuclear weapon with a small quantity of low capacity tactical weapon mark a major movement away from proliferation of potentially world destroy weaponry . furthermore , the movement from proliferation of unusable strategic weapon to tactically viable , small nuclear weapon can be use a a mean of allay the fear of citizen in the united states , russia , and other country pursue policy of non proliferation that their country nuclear defense be not only still viable , but more practicable . 
counterpoint : the unwillingness of the united states and russia to give up tactical nuclear weapon show some of the hypocrisy run through the new start . the treaty should make an effort to eliminate nuclear weapon completely , not just some . furthermore , tactical nuclear weapon be more dangerous than their large strategic counterpart because they be much small , and thus lend themselves to actually be use , which raise serious risk of escalation . 
point : states , a the building block of international society , have an inviolable right to self defense , and this right extend to the possession of miniature , tactical nuclear weapon . often state lack the capacity to defend themselves with conventional weapon . this be particularly true of small and poor state . even wealthy , small state be susceptible to foreign attack , since their wealth cannot make up for their lack of manpower . when arm with tactical nuclear weapon , all state become equal in term of capacity to do harm to one another . if a large state attempt to intimidate , or even invade a small neighbor , it will be unable to effectively cow it , since the small state will have the power to severely damage , or even destroy , the would be invader's military capacity with a few well place miniature nuclear missile 1 . an example of this be the 2008 invasion of georgia by russian troop , which would likely never have occur have georgia possess an arsenal of tactical nuclear weapon , a russia would have think twice when consider that it large tank formation could be wipe out by a single well place tactical warhead . clearly , nuclear weapon serve in many way to equalize state irrespective of size , allow them to more effectively defend themselves . 
counterpoint : while state should of course have the right to defend themselves , this do not extend to the possession and use of tactical nuclear weapon . just a biological and chemical weapon be ban by international treaty , so too have the international community generally acknowledge that nuclear proliferation be negative , which be why so many treaty be dedicate to non proliferation 1 . it be a tragedy that nuclear weapon exist , even more so that a few country be still seek to develop them . it be well to fight this movement , to keep nuclear weapon in a few hand a possible so a to prevent their development , test , and use by rogue state , terrorist , and other danger to international security . this be all the more true of tactical nuclear weapon , whose small size and destructive capacity make them not only easy for terrorist to acquire , but also to be use , and thus to instigate a rapid escalation to full scale nuclear war .
