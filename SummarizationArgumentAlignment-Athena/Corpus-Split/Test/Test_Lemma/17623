point : violent video game do not only affect individual but also society a a whole . the sole purpose of a player in these game be to be an aggressor . the heartlessness in these game and joy of kill innocent people create a desensitization and disinhibition to violence that can ultimately lead to a more violent society . a bruce bartholow study in 2011 prove for the first time the causal association between desensitisation to violence and increase human aggression1 . they be also a very selfish , lonely form of entertainment which undermine the structure of an ordered , interdependent society . a study conduct by psychologist in 2007 find that of 430 primary school child , 'the kid who play more violent video game change over the school year to become more verbally aggressive , more physically aggressive and less helpful to others . '2 
counterpoint : desensitisation be not altogether a bad development . 'for patient suffer from arachnophobia , fear of fly , or post traumatic stress disorder , therapist be begin to use virtual reality a a desensitization tool . '1 furthermore , society have decide to embrace violent video game , which a a result be very profitable . these game be write for adult , rather than child , and the rating system warns of any violent content . in a modern world , the role of protect young people should lie with responsible parent who know their kid best and take an active interest in their leisure time , discourage or bar them from unsuitable activity . in this case , there be not enough justification for government to intervene in people's leisure time . 
point : both experimental and non experimental research have show that violent video game damage young people play them in both the short and long term , lead to criminal and anti social behaviour . exposure to violent video game cause aggressive thought and feeling . it also create unwanted psychological arousal and belief in a 'scary world' , especially among young child . this be particularly significant a video game graphic develop to become ever more realistic . the effect of violent video game be even bad than those of film and tv because of the interactive element that exist in video game . in addition , most video game be play alone , whereas cinema and television be usually a social experience , allow social pressure to filter the experience of violence upon the viewer . an australian senate committee establish to look at this issue in 1993 conclude 'there be sufficient anecdotal evidence of a linkage that the community cannot fail to act to control a situation which have the very real potential to affect young people 1 . 
counterpoint : each of the three approach to prove a correlation between violent video game and criminal behaviour have it flaw . studies that look for correlation between exposure to violent video game and real world aggression can never prove that the game cause physical aggression1 . randomized test , which assign subject to play violent or nonviolent game and then compare level of aggression , depend on lab base measure of aggression that be difficult to compare with real life aggression . finally , longitudinal test , which assess behaviour over time within a group , be a middle ground between the other two but similarly cannot prove it be the video game specifically that lead to increase aggression . in contrast to the claim that the effect of violent video game be bad than those of tv , a potter study in 1999 find that 'children be more likely to be affect and more likely to imitate aggressive act if the violence be depict more realistically . '2 
point : multiple group contend that the interactive nature of computer game considerably blur the line that separate fantasy from reality1 . as a result , game player be likely to become psychologically disturb by the violence contain within these product . it be conceivable that many young gamers will view the new age of video game a fair depiction or representation of reality , real world theme , real world personality , real world violence . because violent video game frequently develop and an exaggerated level of violence and destructiveness , they may arouse a belief that in a scary world . if this be true , a great level of fear and paranoia can be expect from such gamers in the real world than be justified . this may have the potential to lead to many adverse social effect from these gamers , such a social disengagement . 
counterpoint : violent video game , far from cause psychological disturbance , be beneficial to the mental health of child . experiments show visual , track benefit from video game , particularly shoot em ups : us scientist shawn green and daphne bavelier , be commission to perform a study in 2003 by the national institute of health . according to the bbc , they find that regular player of shoot em ups , such a half life and medal of honour , have much good visual skill than most of the population1 . the researcher have show that gamers be particularly good at spot detail in busy , confuse scenes1 . experimental test show positive focus effect of video game : us scientist green and bavelier find focus benefit from shoot em up game , even to the extent that they could be use a a beneficial tool to treat attention deficit disorder2 . 
point : the government have the right , and indeed the obligation , to impose restriction that increase the security of citizen and encourage peaceful relation between them . the foundation of the social contract be the state provide security for all participate citizen . if the state believe that violent video game increase the propensity of user to commit violent act , it be obligate to impose restriction that will prevent such effect . the right of individual citizen to do a they wish , and play the video game they like most , however violent , be subordinate to the government's right to increase security through the enforcement of restriction . for example , one accept the government's right to restrict what we carry onto aircraft in order to prevent violent attack . that be not to say there aren't limit to what we can carry on , just a violent video game be still available to adult we can still carry laptop and mobile phone onto aircraft . ultimately however , it must be accept that the government's right to protect society include a right to restrict the sale of violent game . 
counterpoint : the government have no such right to restrict the right of free speech inherent in all video game . in a 2011 judgement , the american supreme court rule while state have legitimate power to protect child from harm , 'that do not include a free float power to restrict the idea to which child may be expose . ' 1 this be in part due to the fear that to restrict violent video game would be a step towards the banning or restriction of book consider antithetical to the view of the government . a state could ban all book or film that paint a negative image of society or encourage revolution , however that be clearly the action of a dictatorial or authoritarian state . stan lee , the creator of comic book character like the hulk and spiderman , see a comparison to the attempt in the 1950s to restrict the sale of comic book . comic book , it be say , contribute to 'juvenile delinquency' . a senate subcommittee investigate and decide the u . s . could not 'afford the calculated risk involve in feed it child , through comic book , a concentrated diet of crime , horror and violence . ' 2 as lee note , in hindsight this appear comical2 . the same mistake cannot be make with violent video game .
