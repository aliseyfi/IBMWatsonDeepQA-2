point : cultural heritage be often very important to people , particularly to new immigrant who be already feel the loss of their old way of life . it be a matter of luck whether we be bear in a country with lot of opportunity , or be force to travel if we wish to seek a good life . as such , we should not penalise such unfortunate people but rather allow them to continue to practice important cultural practice . britain have introduce support for a number of non christian faith school that both respect and encourage the faith and culture of it student , many of whom be first or second generation immigrant . 1 
counterpoint : it may well be arbitrary where we be bear , but that do not make it any less true : we make distinction between citizen of one country and another country for practical purpose , and state have primary duty to their own citizen first and foremost . people in the host country also have a right to the preservation of their culture , and therefore if necessary incomers should integrate , and give up their cultural practice a the price pay for the benefit migration . 
point : assimilation expect immigrant to shed their cultural heritage it be expect that recent immigrant to a country will shed major part of their culture and value to adapt to those of the host country . but , this be unrealistic . nobody will quickly shed and adopt the new cultural element of a nation ; a major flaw of the assimilation model . for example , america , often use a the prime example of assimilation , be not the melting pot once think . america be a land of many culture , where important and sustained cultural division between americans persist . assimilationist doctrine claim it be work towards a sense of one american ness , but there be two problem with this notion . one , america be a land build on democratic difference very different political group can and do exist . two , american assimilation have have a troubling history consisting of a dominating , white power structure aim to restrict extend american citizen to all citizen , and deny human right to all citizen often because of race or skin colour . 
counterpoint : immigrants demonstrate their own willingness to integrate in their often strenuous effort to reach their destination . in america , where thousand of migrant have flee over the last century , the assimilation process be a proven success . it be one of the most successful society and economy in the world . it enjoy relative peace , cohesion , and civic engagement among it various group it s two main political party disagree often but agree on the fundamental freedom of the american citizen . furthermore , the success of the assimilation model be find in the civil right movement that ultimately lead to the election of barack obama in 2009 . such a compelling empirical example of assimilation be hard to compete with . 
point : allowing people to preserve their own culture allow other people to understand different cultural practice and way of live life . this exposure to new experience enrich the cultural practice of all : we be well able to make choice about the way in which we wish to live our life , whether that be a matter of what food we eat or what religion we practice . the amish community in rural america be just one example ; 'it be not necessary to live an amish life to appreciate what they can teach us' , the mere knowledge that one can be happy without constant access to life's modern technology be a humble thought . 1 
counterpoint : in reality , multiculturalism be a form of segregation : cultural practice will not diffuse across the artificial border , because people view the two community a very distinct . that be , they view the cultural practice of other community a something they rather than we do . true diversity be achieve through integration : even when people integrate they retain some of their cultural practice , and these can be experience by others a something their friend do , rather than something a whole separate community do . 
point : neither the state nor the majority or host community have a monopoly on the knowledge of the best way to live life . as such , we each have to seek out this good life for ourselves ; it vary depend on our individual value and priority . 
counterpoint : there be some wrong way to live life , and the rhetoric of multiculturalism make it hard for the law to intervene when thing go too far : we be force to step back in the name of tolerance .
