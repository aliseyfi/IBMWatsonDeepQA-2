point : most secretaries general be compromise candidate from middle power and with little prior fame . high profile candidate , like bill clinton , be often tout for the job , but be almost always reject a unpalatable to some of the permanent member state . for instance , figure like charles de gaulle or dwight eisenhower be rumor to have be consider for the first secretary general position 1 , but be reject in favor of the uncontroversial norwegian , trygve lie . thus excellent leader and statesman be outright exclude from the selection process because the permanent five have no incentive to nominate a strong , forceful figure for the role . popular election would reverse this bias , a only well know international heavy weight figure would be able to gain sufficient vote from citizen all over the world . californian governor jerry brown sign a bill decide to award all california electoral vote to the candidate for us president that win the national popular vote 2 . the following analogy can be make : popular vote reflect the opinion of all over whom the person elect will have power , and should not be surpass by bureaucracy such a veto power or the electoral college system . 
counterpoint : simply because secretaries general be elect through a compromise process do not mean that they will not perform well on the job or that they will be lackey of the permanent member . for example , kofi annan become a powerful and charismatic leader during his time in office . in spite of the us have support his nomination , he be often critical of it foreign policy and human right record in the war against terror . another secretary general , dag hammarskjöld , develop the un emergency force , deploy during the 1956 suez crisis in which two of the permanent five member be implicate . the deployment of troop be do with no authorization from the security council and have since significantly shape the protocol on un peacekeeping mission . 1 
point : gender and geographic diversity would improve among candidate . out of eight secretaries general so far , a woman have yet to lead the organization . furthermore , woman candidate be rarely even consider . vaira vike freiberga , only get seven positive vote when she run against ban ki moon . 1 getting rid of the cumbersome veto process might encourage more woman to come forward . currently , the status quo tend to perpetuate itself . the representative who end up make the decision on a candidate viability be usually men , from wealthy and privileged background . by bring more people into the decision making process , the door be open to more type of people . for example , hilary clinton or german chancellor merkel might be candidate , as well a figure from eastern europe who have hold no sg position so far . 
counterpoint : geographic diversity be already ensure by the system of regional rotation in the selection of candidate . as for gender diversity , woman find it hard to get elect even in country which have strong tradition in protect and promote woman s right . those liberal country represent a small minority of un member state and of world population . confronted with a world electorate , a woman s chance of get elect would be slim to none . 
point : given the evolution in the role of the secretary general , he she need skill beyond those require of a chief administrator and more closely resemble those of a statesman . like in the case of head of state , have to compete in a contest for the popular vote would require candidate to demonstrate their competence for the job and their vision for the future of the organization . 1 these would then become the primary consideration in the popular decision , not their pliability to the interest of the world s richest nation . 
counterpoint : to assume that a the member of the united nations general assembly would be mature enough to select the most qualified , most competent candidate would be naïve . the majority be , in fact , much more likely to select a candidate that would suit their own interest . this will not only impede the selection process , but might result in an unsuitable candidate be the final choice .
