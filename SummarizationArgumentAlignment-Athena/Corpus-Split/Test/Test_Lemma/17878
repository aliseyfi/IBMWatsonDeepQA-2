point : suicide be a waste of life . it be an immoral act that ignore the sacrosanct nature of human life something that be universally consider to be the case a show by be something nearly all religion consider to be the case . 1 failure to criminalize such a flagrant violation of the sanctity of human life condemn any society a irreligious and immoral . nowadays we hear everyone talk about human right ; we hear precious little about human obligation . if we believe in the moral worth of human right we do so because we think that human life be a wonderful thing and something with which we should not interfere . whether the interference be by others or by ourselves , any action that denigrate human life be morally wrong for precisely the reason that we support human right . we have an obligation to preserve all life , include our own . 
counterpoint : the question whether or not human life be sacred should not intrude on the issue of suicide legislation because no clear proof be possible one way or the other . we respect human right because we value the liberty and autonomy of individual ; we want to be able to make our own decision and we likewise affirm the right of others to make their own decision . the free , autonomous decision to take one s own life should be respect a a legitimate exercise of one s individual liberty . human liberty be sacrosanct and should only be limit where clear social harm be cause ; suicide affect only the individual and so it should be permit 
point : suicide be an entirely selfish act that cause immense pain and suffering for those loved one that be leave behind . it be also cowardly ; rather than face your problem and be strong , you instead take the easy way out and kill yourself . it be important , therefore , to instil a strong sense of responsibility to one s family and for one s affair and to do this by punish those who try and fail to perpetrate this selfish and cowardly act . 
counterpoint : this be only an objection to particular case of suicide ; it cannot be make into a general case because some suicide really do only affect the individual those in which there be no extended family or friendship group . and that an act be , on occasion , selfish be not sufficient ground to prohibit it . indeed , ostracise one s friend or walk out on one s family can upset people but we be hardly likely to deny people the liberty to make such individual , private life choice . nobody have the right to force people to live in circumstance that cause them unhappiness . suicide should be view in exactly the same way . 
point : individual action be shape by what norm and standard be set by society . by prohibit suicide , society send out a message that it be not an acceptable action . legislation be a useful social tool , in that it proscribe the limit of individual action . and by fail to prohibit suicide , society fails to add the ultimate sanction of it law into the balance of any decision whether or not to commit suicide . many of those who have try and fail to commit suicide never attempt it again . this suggest that many who kill themselves do so because of their particular short term circumstance , perhaps while ill , suffer financial problem or under emotional stress , rather than through a consider and rational decision . more than 30 of suicide be precipitate by intimate partner problem , more than 10 by job problem and 10 by financial problem . 1 given this , even a small deterrent will help to save many life that be currently waste needlessly . 
counterpoint : society can perfectly well spread the message that suicide be not a valid life choice without criminalize and punish those that have try and fail to perpetrate it . moreover , we have grave doubt about the practical use of anti suicide legislation . it be highly dubious that people who be drive to contemplate suicide will be dissuade by the knowledge that they would be break the law . the spectre of punishment only await those who fail to commit suicide . these people have already decide that their life be not worth living ; brand them criminal and punish them be hardly likely to make them reconsider their decision . 
point : like abortion , euthanasia , clone and genetic engineering , suicide undermines the sanctity and inviolability of the human body . it be legitimate to legislate against such action because the sanctity of the human body be an intrinsic constituent part of the respect for human dignity , which be the sine qua non of social life in any country . 
counterpoint : suicide be different from abortion or cloning or euthanasia in the important respect that it involve only one individual and his choice about the way he live and by extension , when he die . so we can deny any link to these other phenomenon . in addition , we can defend suicide on the same basis a one might plausibly and robustly defend all the others : on the basis of the value of individual autonomy . human dignity be a value that be inextricably link to the free exercise of individual autonomy ; it be the absence of autonomy and the domination of another man over the slave that make slavery a clear violation of basic human dignity .
