point : federal state be able to remove trade barrier between member which would otherwise exist if there be independent state such a difficulty in move good due to border . this increase internal trade and economic growth and encourage investor . 1 federal unit be able to share resource and concentrate on produce what they be best at call comparative advantage at a good economy of scale . even in case of agreed free trade area between state , there be no overarch authority to ensure timely compliance to agreement . 2 finally , large economic unit be more able to influence international trade regime . 31 eu business , 2007 , 'eu single market benefit , ' 10 department for business , enterprise and regulatory reform , 2007 , 'guide to benefits of the eu , ' 11 2bbc 12 , 2011 , 'us and mexico end cross border truck dispute 12 3stanford encyclopedia of philosophy , 2010 , 'federalism 9 
counterpoint : free trade area be able to operate quite successfully even if they lack an overarching authority and full integration of currency , such a nafta . 1economic homogenisation be not necessarily a good thing . common currency be best deploy in optimal currency area , which be area with sufficiently similar economy that a common currency can successfully function . problems exist where there be a lack of political capital between nation in a federation or when there be logistical barrier such a the different language within the eu or the differing strength of public finance . 2 there be no reason why federal state be require for comparative advantage to exist , though economy of scale could be less . 1 office of the united states trade representative , 2004 , 'nafta : a decade of success , ' 13 . 2wikipedia 14 , 2011 , 'optimal currency area 14 
point : federal state allow local decision making to suit local need due to their tiered decision make structure . this ensure that citizen be able to determine how they should live their life without infringe upon the right of citizen in other federal unit who may have different opinion . however on security matter which affect the entire federal state , citizen be well protect because the federal unit be strong together than apart . a federal state also create a common sense of purpose than can dissuade conflict between the federal unit . a good historical example of this behaviour be the agreement of the swiss cantons to come together to collectively protect and enrich themselves from outside threat in 1848 . 11 history of switzerland , 'switzerland's history , ' 21 
counterpoint : states should not be overly concern with size a a measure of strength since this be merely increase the area that need defending . instead they should be concern with have common sense of identity that encourage cooperation . russia , nigeria and india be example of large federate state which suffer from internal insurgency cause by political grievance . 1 the democratic republic of the congo be an excellent example of a large federate state which have prove incapable of defend it border . 2 it may be the case a common identity be well form in independent nation state . smaller state like monaco and singapore continue to exist with relative security in contrast . 1 alertnet , 2011 , 'bin laden death weaken russia insurgency official , ' 22 the washington post , 2006 , 'grievances fuel insurgency , says nigeria media 23 'inside the maoist insurgency in india's jharkand state' , bbc news 24 
point : it be not clear what the logical end point for split country over political difference would be . since each individual have a unique set of preference , or at least there be large number of group of people with different preference , the state must aggregate preference at some point . it make more sense for the state to aggregate preference in such a way that create effective state that can meet their aggregate goal rather than attempt to find pure nation state . furthermore , nation be often scatter in area which do not provide a clear location for a state . an example of this be eastern europe or africa where ethnic group and tribe regularly cross state boundary and exist a unconnected pocket . 1 it would be impossible to create state to cater to these group . 1 guardian , 2007 , 'biafran lessons , ' 25 
counterpoint : it be true that there be few state which include homogenous national group . however , there be some iceland and japan for example but there be many state which be predominantly a single nation . and give that proposition have accept that nation be construct , it be possible for people to opt into nationhood . thus autonomous nation state can exist where group of people agree to live with common cultural and political value . therefore , it be not futile to attempt to accommodate a common set of political value within a state . indeed , it be necessary to have some kind of common history , culture , practice or ethnicity often to bind group together . 11stanford encyclopedia of philosophy , 2010 , 'federalism , ' 9 
point : federal state tend to be large and have different economic cycle . this allow the overall state to cope with different economic cycle by use fiscal transfer tax between wealthy state and poor state to fund government programme . 1 so for example if mississippi and new mexico be pay for all their service themselves from their own tax they would have debt of over 500 of gdp , 2 however at the beginning of the republic it be the southern states who be the rich due to their cotton wealth . 1euro 27 economics , 'example : fiscal transfer 27 2the 28 economist , 2011 , 'america's fiscal union : greek americans , ' 28 
counterpoint : in most case part of federated state remain in similar economic position relative to other section . california and texas be regularly the most economically successful us state . rather than receive economic benefit , they have federal tax transfer to the weak perform state in the union . a similar argument be apparent with the german bailouts in the 2010 11 eurozone financial crisis . 11the economist , 2011 , 'america's fiscal union : greek americans , ' 28 the economist , 2011 , 'german business and politics : goodbye to berlin , ' 29
