point : control of one s own body be the most fundamental of human right . no government should be permit to define how it citizen can express themselves . the distinction between the permissible and the impermissible should be draw at the line of consent . this be not a novel distinction . your property cannot be steal from you if you agree to give it away . you have no legal remedy if your property be damage by another with your consent , or if you damage it yourself . why should there be a moral difference when this property be flesh and blood ? paternalism in this instance only protect those who do not want to be protect . 
counterpoint : every government have a duty to protect the moral and physical health of all it citizen . firstly , the define characteristic of sadomasochism be that it do harm to others . the activity have a victim . it be not a simple question of one individual be permit to harm himself . secondly , the fact of the victim s consent be immaterial . the use of seatbelt be mandatory because citizen should not be allow to risk their body for such a nugatory freedom . citizens be allow to lose or jeopardize their material asset through foolishness , since the asset be replaceable , or at least not critical to survival . paternalism exist to protect people from themselves . 
point : the criminalisation of s m remove legal protection from individual who suffer an abuse of consent while submit to sadistic practice . where a dominant partner ignores safe word or push a session too far , the criminal status of s m may lead to a victim be prosecute alongside a perpetrator . alternately , victim may be disincentivised from approach the police altogether . 
counterpoint : victims of any form of crime , regardless of their life choice , be free to come to the police for protection and will be provide with the same protection a anyone else . the fact that people who commit crime may feel less comfortable go to the police to avoid self incrimination be not a reason to remove those law . 
point : it be sufficient for the decriminalization of sadomasochism that each participant be aware of the hazard inherent in the fetish they will be explore and consent to them . no law prohibit people from refuse to wear a condom during sexual intercourse , notwithstanding the peril of infection . 
counterpoint : the notion of consent cannot apply to a practice in which participant lack the ability to withdraw at any give time . rape case be easy to prosecute a it be clear and evident that the victim do not consent to the activity . the legalization of sadomasochism would create situation in which consent have be give beforehand but cannot be withdraw during the activity . 
point : the idealization of physical beauty within american and european culture have create a demand for increasingly interventionist form of cosmetic enhancement . women and men be prepared to pay hundred of thousand of pound to have their face , breast and genitals maim and modify by surgeon , to have their skin bleach or their facial muscle temporarily paralyze by beautician and to be badger , bully and blackmail into comply with restrictive diet and extensive regime of physical exertion by domineer personal trainer . except in the most extreme and obvious case of emotional or psychological disturbance , adult be automatically assume to be capable of consent to these act . 
counterpoint : when less painful but equally effective variation on exist beauty treatment enter the market , they quickly assume a position of dominance . women and men who want to enhance their physical appearance do not automatically seek out the most painful way of do so .
