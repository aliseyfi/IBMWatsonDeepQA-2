point : if we accept the term 'arts' to cover museum , gallery , theatre and musical and film project , then it be clear that without public funding in many country a large proportion of art organisation would be lose . taking the uk a a prime example of what happen when funding for the art be cut , we can see that of the 1333 company which apply for funding from arts council england in 2010 only 695 be successful . a cut of 100m have mean this number have drop from the 849 organisation that be grant funding in the previous application process1 . the arts council be responsible for the funding of cultural venue , theatre , gallery and perform art group , and this cut to it budget demonstrate the depth of repercussion that occur when the art cease to be subsidise . there be also evidence to suggest that the american system of philanthropic donation simply doesn t work in the uk , a investment in the art by the business sector be show in figure release in january 2011 to have fall by 11 2 . 
counterpoint : there be alternative to public funding the art have rely on patronage and donation for a very long time , and there be example of a positive relationship between the art and business enterprise . there could be good utilisation of this relationship america be a prime example of this . although there be organisation set up in america to provide money for the art such a the national endowments for arts set up in 1965 , 1 they rely far more on donation from business and wealthy individual than company do in the uk and europe . given the cut to public spending especially in the uk , an introduction of american philanthropic idea be a viable mean to bridge the gap in funding cause by the economic situation . as well a this , it be important to note that of the 695 organisation give grant , 110 of them be new project . this show that even in a time of economic strife , the limited resource available can be deploy in such a way that art and culture remain up to date and that new art can still be produce . 
point : since the lottery begin in britain in1994 over 25 billion have be give to good cause . last year 2010 16 . 67 of the donation make be to art organisation , the same amount that be give to sport and heritage projects1 . this money make up an significant part of many organisation s budget , and stop this funding whilst still give to sport and heritage foundation would be discriminatory and unfair . equal distribution of this public lottery be the only way to ensure that people be be fairly treat when they buy their lottery ticket , even though the good cause their money go to may not be their primary concern . 
counterpoint : in the same year 2010 , 50 of the donation make by the national lottery in the uk be to health , education , environment , and charitable cause . this in itself demonstrate an awareness of the need to prioritise public spending into more socially and economically important area . on the subject of fairness , it would be difficult to argue that the same number of people benefit from donation to the art a they do from donation to health , education and charitable organisation . even if buyer of lottery ticket do not think about where their money go , if they be to do so they would be happy to see it go to these area rather than to arts project that be beneficial only to a select group . 
point : the reduction in available service would make art less accessible to all , and although the demand would still be there , force company to ensure they make a profit will drive ticket price up and prevent those from poor background from be able to enjoy the same cultural experience a those who be wealthy . subsidy can ensure that cheap ticket be available and that the art remain democratically open to all , regardless of income or social class . it also allow other public institution which have similar economic problem such a school and college to provide good service for their student , give them access to well teach resource and therefore a good quality of education . 1 it would be unfair and inaccurate to assume that the benefit of art subsidy only go to the wealthy elite , a the focus be on provide art project for all member of society . free and cheap access to the art be crucial for education . without subsidy school and young people would not be able to take affordable music lesson , visit museum or gallery , or to attend play or concert , and would thereby be prevent from understand and enjoy their culture fully . as well a be important for personal enrichment , access to the art also make the young aware of their cultural heritage both nationally and in world term , increase the likelihood of continued interest in the art and it creation in the future . 
counterpoint : other , equally deserve public leisure activity either do not need to , or simply do not receive any such funding why be be that the art be deem to have great importance , especially give that they be prove to not be self sufficient . certain art form , such a live music event and special exhibition charge entrance fee and people be willing to pay them . looking at it from the perspective of what art actually mean , if people be not willing to pay to support it , then it have surely fail in it purpose to provide something culturally relevant . brian micklethwait of the libertarian alliance argue that good art can survive economic difficulty , 1 and that if the art really be a important in society a some people say , then the public would be willing to spend money to view it , just a they do for a concert or a football match .
