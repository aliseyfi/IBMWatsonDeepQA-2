point : according to shell geoscientist marion king hubbert , the production rate of a limited resource will follow a roughly symmetrical logistic distribution curve similar in shape to the bell curve base on the limit of exploitability and market pressure . the peak of world oilfield discovery occur in 1965 but global energy demand be still rise wikipedia , peak oil . this mean we ll likely hit peak oil in the come decade , after which global oil production will decline rapidly . the effect of this will be devastating : oil price will rise , global transport chain will fall silent and the use of many other oil relate product , like plastic , in our everyday life will be near impossible . 
counterpoint : the threat of peak oil be exaggerated 
point : the production cost per barrel of oil from oil sand be somewhere between 40 to 80 per barrel , and from oil shale somewhere between 50 to over 100 per barrel world energy outlook 2008 , 2008 . the international energy agency expect oil price to be around or over 100 per barrel in the come decade medium term oil and gas markets 2011 , 2011 , rise to 120 per barrel in 2035 world energy outlook 2011 factsheet , 2011 , this be exactly what should be expect with surging demand for oil while supply do not keep up . moreover , with technology advance , the production cost per barrel for unconventional oil be likely to decline even far a field be develop can non conventional oil fill the gap ? , 2009 . that mean this be a sound investment decision . 
counterpoint : the production cost the international energy agency estimate do not include the cost associate with carbon dioxide emissions world energy outlook 2008 , 2008 or any other negative externality . given the many other externality , like pollution and social cost , the actual cost to society of unconventional oil be a lot high than the monetary cost . given the estimate the proposition provide for cost provide relatively little profit margin unconventional oil could easily become unviable should the cost of pollution be bring into the cost of production , for example if a carbon tax be impose . 
point : currently , global oil supply be dominate by the opec cartel , consist of country like venezuela and saudi arabia . in 2010 , opec country hold about 80 of the world s global proven conventional oil reserve , with the bulk of this in the middle east . this create a dangerous dependency for all oil import country . suppose the united states or the european union would face a serious deterioration in diplomatic relation with the middle east , after which opec would decide to cut oil supply the consequence would be dire , a the 1973 oil crisis show . 
counterpoint : if a nation state s energy security work like an investment portfolio , invest in oil to diversify from oil be not diversification at all , since the two type of oil be asset whose return correlate . also , venezuela , who have the world s large proven oil sand deposit , be a member of opec , and it leader hugo chavez be famously anti american , so the actual diversification happening be only marginal .
