point : multilateral aid , particularly when deliver through ngos or the un , allow for the efficient pooling of financial resource . much a when an individual make a donation to a major charity , their small contribution go much far when combine with those of many others . particularly in the face of pressure to reduce foreign aid , america can still make a significant impact on development in other part of the world through combine resource with other donor . by contrast , bilateral aid arrangement be often short term and subject to change at short notice a a result of political or economic shift in the donor country . amidst grow fear of a u . s . debt default next week , for example , the foreign operations subcommittee of the house of representatives have cut bilateral economic and development assistance to the rest of the develop world by an average of around 25 percent . 1 multilateral aid programme be therefore more stable and can plan more usefully for the long term . 
counterpoint : multilateral aid through ngos or un agency be less cost efficient . direct aid mean that that aid be immediately reach it destination and can begin work for the recipient government . when fund go to multilateral aid organization , some of these fund will be spend by the agency itself for administrative purpose . those fund which reach the field be often seriously delay . gavi global alliance for vaccines and immunisations , for instance , have be show to lack price transparency and cost effective purchasing for the money it be donate . 1 moreover , when ngos be use , the potential for abuse of resource exists , mean less of the fund actually reach their intended destination . the un , in particular , have a bad record of financial inefficiency . 
point : multilateral aid tend to be less tie to the political self interest of individual donor country . one criticism of bilateral aid arrangement be that they be often draw up base on self interest . major power who provide international aid have tend to direct their aid to former colony or country with which they have significant strategic tie , economic interest or potential market . often , aid money must be spend on good or service from the donor country . while the united states do not have a develop a colonial history a some other major donor state , it do have a history of provide aid to country it see a strategic partner . this be particularly true during the cold war , but have now emerge a a practice in the war on terror . aid that be give multilaterally be therefore much more likely to go to develop country on the basis of need , and of where it have the most potential for good . 
counterpoint : providers of aid , for the very reason that they be spend their own money , should have their interest serve by an aid arrangement . significant opposition exist to foreign aid in the united states . for this reason , it be important to demonstrate to the american public that their tax dollar be be spend in a way that benefit the nation and or be use responsibly by the recipient nation . sadly , many aid dollar have be waste on country with corrupt regime that have misuse the fund , or the recipient have lack the resource internally to use the fund productively . the world bank's strategy in africa , for example , have downplay underlying structural oppression in which they be complicit , include corrupt power relation . 1 this misuse be more likely to happen if aid be channel through , and supervise by unaccountable international bureaucracy instead of give direct to country in need . 
point : multilateral aid arrangement tend to avoid unnecessarily coercive condition . one of the strong criticism of bilateral aid be the tendency for donor country to place strict political , diplomatic or economic condition on the receipt of that aid . for example , the united states greet pakistan's cooperation with the war on terror with a generous economic and military aid package , worth more than 18 . 7 billion between 2002 and 2010 , 1 despite year of sanction previously . countries receive development loan have often face requirement for change in internal policy on a range of issue not always directly tie to the aid itself . 
counterpoint : multilateral aid have the potential to be equally or more coercive than bilateral aid arrangement . the history of world bank and international monetary fund austerity program and structural adjustment policy in the developing world have amply demonstrate that sometimes multilateral organization can impose potent and harmful condition on recipient , interfere with the internal affair of other nation and do long lasting harm . these agency have also be heavily criticize for their focus on economic concern at the expense of more basic human need , such a health , education and the alleviation of poverty .
