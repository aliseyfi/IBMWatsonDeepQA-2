point : according to carol shakeshaft an expert in sexual misconduct by teacher : e ducators who use social medium for personal and intimate conversation and contact be not much different from those who spend their time hang out with student at the beach . you have to ask why a teacher would do this . the honest answer be that it rarely have anything to do with student learning . 1 interacting with one s teachers the same way a with one s friend , share personal information , can only erode the respect and distance that a teacher need in order to be an authority figure and a mentor for her young charge . even if such friendship be entirely innocent , they would still cast enough suspicion on the teacher student relationship to put considerable strain on the teacher s role a educator and their ability to do the job . 
counterpoint : this law assume the bad of teacher and frame all teacher student interaction in a negative way . yet so many educator have find contact through social medium to be a powerful tool in facilitate learning and expand knowledge . it may be more appropriate to establish some guideline for how to use such medium safely and professionally , rather than ban their use altogether . 
point : social network website have prove to be particularly effective for child grooming by pedophile 1 . teachers be already in a position of power and trust in the relationship with their student . being allow to communicate with student via facebook would greatly facilitate misconduct by a teacher who want to start an inappropriate relationship with a student , by give him virtually unlimited access to the student after school . in fact , many such relationship do involve some form of electronic contact1 . by ban this form of communication , the law would make it hard for teacher with bad intention to carry them through . 
counterpoint : child grooming , and have a sexual relationship with a minor be already criminal offence . if that doesn t stop a potential predator , break the facebook law in the process be unlikely to . a teacher who intend to abuse a child will still find ample opportunity to do so . this law take a powerful educational tool from the hand of good teacher while do very little to stop bad one from act inappropriately . 
point : it be very difficult for a child to realize that he be be groom ; they be unlikely to know the risk1 . after all , a teacher be regard a a trusted adult . but , if the child be aware that private electronic contact between teacher and student be prohibit by law , the child will immediately know the teacher be do something he be not suppose to if he initiate private electronic contact . this will therefore act a an effective warning sign to the child and might prompt the child to tell a parent or another adult about what be go on . 
counterpoint : even assume the child already know about the law and therefore that online contact with their teacher be not allow , which will often not be the case , a child will trust the authority figure close to him . the teacher can easily convince the child that the rule be not that important or that their relationship be an exception . 
point : access to a teacher s private information and photo may lead to weaken her position a an educator . how can a teacher convincingly speak against smoking or substance abuse if student have access to picture portray the teacher themselves drink or smoke 1 ? for example , a principal from the bronx , who have be try to impose a strict dress code at her school , be brand a hypocrite by her student when a risqu√© photo of her be find on her facebook page 2 . and even if the teacher will be careful not to post anything inappropriate on her page , a friend or acquaintance might thereby undermine the teacher . a strict separation of personal and professional life would prevent such incident from happen . 
counterpoint : teachers should always be careful about what they post and how they portray themselves on the internet , whether they be friend with their student or not . such picture might surface even if student don t have direct access to them . an educator should lead by example and someone who be of dubious moral character may not be the best suited person to teach at a school in the first place .
