point : the sanction cause real and unacceptable harm to the cuban people . sanctions deprive cuba of low cost food that the united states could provide so hit the poor yet they do not affect the ruling elite . 1 in the 1990 s cuba lose 70 billion in trade 2 and 1 . 2 billion in international loan because of u . s . sanction . cuba be too poor a country not to suffer from these loss . the dominance of america in the pharmaceutical industry , moreover , mean that it be actually impossible for cubans to gain access to many drug and other medical equipment , include the only curative treatment for some pediatric leukemia . 3 america would be the natural market for most cuban product , and it refusal to accept good with even the tiny cuban input from third nation damage cuba s ability to trade with others . other south american country have show their reliance on the type of loan that cuba be deny in the last few year to keep their economy on track . 
counterpoint : sanctions didn t cause the economic failure in cuba . the communist political and economic system have be show to lead to economic collapse all over the world , whether sanction be in place or not . centralization , collectivism , state control , bureaucracy , and restriction on private initiative totalitarian style economic policy be what be to blame for the cuban people s economic suffering . 1 even if sanction be lift , lack of private ownership , foreign exchange and tradable commodity would hold cuba back . the international trade commission find a minimal effect on the cuban economy from sanction . 2 in fact , it be by use sanction to pressure cuba into economic and political reform that the us can best contribute to an economic recovery there . 
point : sanctions be pointless and counterproductive . they ve make no political difference in the last 43 year , why would they now ? they mean that the us can be blame for all the failure of the cuban economy and to justify repressive measure for security , 1 and therefore encourage the retrenchment of both . in time when the cuban economy be booming , a in 2005 when the economy grow by 8 , the impotence of the sanction become clear . 2 president bush claim to want to empower civil society in cuba but he also argue that the best way to achieve this in china be to trade and spread american value . 3 cuba s geographical and cultural proximity make it very likely to change quickly when they be able to freely interact with the united states through travel and trade . 4 5 
counterpoint : sanctions be a proven policy tool and can pressure a regime that be extremely repressive into reform . aggressive u . s . engagement and pressure contribute to the collapse of the soviet bloc and it can work again . as in the cold war there be radio station that be effective at provide news and information about the outside world to cuba . 1 sanctions be also , accord to colin powell , a moral statement of america s disapproval for the castro regime . blaming america for all economic woe didn t trick ordinary russians and it win t trick the cubans . now be exactly the time that the united states should be tighten down the screw so that castro s successor be force to make real change . 
point : sanctions on cuba be illegal and damage america s international standing . they violate the un charter , law on the freedom of navigation , and repeat united nations resolution since 1992 pass with only the us and israel in opposition . 1 furthermore , some part of the helms burton act be extra territorial in their effect on businessmen from third nation and therefore cause significant protest around the world . this make a mockery of the us claim to be a guardian of international law , not only in it dealing with cuba but also in the negotiation over the future of iraq . america could achieve it goal internationally more easily if it be not mark with evidence of it lack of respect for international law . 
counterpoint : the united nations resolutions condemn the sanction have never pass through the security council and therefore lack any authority . the cubans themselves be also violate international agreement in particular the 1928 inter american convention on asylum and the international covenant on civil and political rights by surround embassy in it capital by armed force to thwart the right of it citizen to seek asylum and systematically deny that right to the cuban people . 1 
point : the united states will also benefit from the opening of trade with cuba economically . mid western republicans have all vote to drop the embargo because of the potential for profit in their farming state . even the modest opening of the embargo in 2000 have increase sale of farm product immensely have go from nothing 1 to 344 million in 2010 . 2 this be a market for american product as well a a local producer . further , if sanction end americans will be able to stop pretend that they prefer bolivian cigar ! 
counterpoint : cuba will never make up more than a tiny percentage of america s trade and it be able to source and sell all the product it need elsewhere . even if cuba be a vital market for american good it would be worth give up some economic growth in order to maintain a commitment to the freedom of the cuban people . as it be , the total cuban gdp be a drop in the ocean and at this point be almost entirely irrelevant to the united states . 
point : sanctions be not the will of the american people but of a small minority of embittered cuban americans in florida who be be pander to due to their importance in election in a swing state . 1 congressman charles rangel argue that the only success of the sanction policy have be to appease the republican constituency in florida . 2 national opinion generally express no preference or oppose the ban , in a 2009 cbs poll ask do you think the united states should or should not re establish diplomatic and trade relation with cuba ? 67 say should . 3 sanctions remain in place be electioneer government at it bad , domestic interest group control government foreign policy . as karl rove have admit when people mention cuba to me , it make me think of three thing : florida , florida , and florida . 4 
counterpoint : the people who care most about the cuban question thoroughly oppose drop sanction . the mid western republicans who vote to drop the travel ban be no less blinker than the cuban americans who vote to keep it . opinion on sanction waver ; the separation of power be specifically in place to allow the white house to maintain a stable policy on issue of national security rather than respond to every change in public opinion . it would not be right for the united states to change it foreign policy when the population be apathetic and have very little opinion on an issue .
