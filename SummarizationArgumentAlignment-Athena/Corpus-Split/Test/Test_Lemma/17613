point : new technology have break down traditional social relationship which provide stability and be important for psychological health . many individual be increasingly become self absorb in videogames and autonomous life on the internet without make lasting connection with people face to face 1 . technology be not necessary for a fulfilling life , a the amish show by avoid technology which damage the community and harm social relation . 2 
counterpoint : traditional social relationship be not necessarily good thing . often , such a with the family , they be arbitrary base on the location that someone live or how they grow up . the internet allow people to form relationship which they can choose to fit their personality and preference . thus , technology be not inherently harmful to socialisation . the amish do not reject technology per se , they just regulate what they use in order to ensure a healthy society . it be just their preference differ from mainstream society . 
point : science have move into new area which violate the boundary of morality . research into cloning of person and animal be take place , as well a work on genetic manipulation . 1 such work be reckless and involve take the position of god a an entity which decide what form of life to create . genetic test involve the abuse of animal , which be use merely a tool in study to increase knowledge . 2 
counterpoint : the state should not preference individual belief system above others and dictate morality accordingly , thus the idea of god be irrelevant give significant number of people do not believe in this a a basis of morality . 
point : technology allow government and those in authority to develop more powerful mean to monitor citizen and control discussion . the totalitarian government of the twentieth century such a stalinist russia utilise modern technology to monitor and indoctrinate population . 1 even in democracy , monitoring of communication and centralisation of information make it much more difficult for an individual to oppose action they do not consider moral a any attempt to organise against it could mean arrest . 2it be no longer the case that citizen can choose to opt out of control by a high body by withdrawal to less controlled area , such a the countryside . 
counterpoint : the proposition have not consider that technology can also empower individual . modern communication allow citizen to organise together to combat centralise control . the use of social networking for the modern movement of flashmobs and the 2011 riot in the united kingdom illustrate this . 1 the internet allow citizen access to vast amount of data previously only available to powerful and connect , allow more informed decision making . 
point : advances in technology have increase the destructive capacity of conflict by enable kill to occur much more rapidly , a can be see by the destruction of the first and second world wars with their unprecedented number of death . 1more advanced society , or rather those with more destructive technology have be able to subjugate and oppress other society with different value structure , such a native americans , aborigines and all other colonise people . 2 the development of weapons of mass destruction have raise the threat of total global destruction . 3 science have produce the mean for more suffering in an almost infinite capacity , which surely outweigh the benefit towards heal the sick . 
counterpoint : the proposition ignore the capacity of science to protect humanity , by allow it to bypass natural phenomenon and survive . the ability of human to colonise other world in the future could be a useful mean to avoid a natural disaster such a the impact of meteor on earth . 
point : the pursuit of industrialisation and the use of modern technology require the generating of enormous amount of energy . such production creates severe damage to the environment via pollution 1 . renewable energy be currently expensive and difficult to reliably produce2 . humanity be treat itself a more important than the billion of other life form on earth who have right themselves . the damage to the environment also threaten to leave the earth uninhabitable , which would also harm humanity s interest . 3 
counterpoint : science respond to the desire of human to research new area . it be be use to address pollution and create sustainable fuel to ensure the survival of the planet . moreover , the effect of development on animal should not be overstate . it be true that many animal have suffer , and whilst wanton cruelty be unacceptable , a cost benefit analysis should be conduct . animals have right and preference , but these be surely weak than human give their reduced capability 1 . development have raise million of human out of poverty and improve their life . 2 scientists be the very group of individual at the forefront of prevent global warming , so to blame them for the misuse of their development be ridiculous . 3
