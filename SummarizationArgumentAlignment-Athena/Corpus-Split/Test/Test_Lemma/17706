point : nuclear power be the most practical renewable energy source a all the others face major difficulty either in scale up to provide enough to be a major component of nation energy mix , don't provide energy all the time , the 'base load' , or cause other environmental problem . nuclear be a proven technology with large firm that can build large amount of nuclear energy generation capacity . 
counterpoint : nuclear power be itself inefficient : for every three unit of energy produce by the reactor core of a u . s . nuclear power plant , two unit be discharge to the environment a waste heat . nuclear plant be build on the shore of lake , river , and ocean because these body provide the large quantity of cool water need to handle the waste heat discharge1 . 
point : although eu country be use energy more efficiently , demand for energy continue to rise , especially in the new eastern european member state . the demand for electricity be expect to rise by 8 9 by 2020 mean a much more urgent need for generate capacity 1 . at the same time world energy consumption be project to expand by 50 from 2005 to 2030 lead to high oil and gas price 2 . the production of renewable energy be not grow at a fast enough pace to replace fossil fuel ; wind , wave and solar simply cannot provide the quantity of energy require . it be possible indeed , desirable to combine nuclear power with other renewables , but nuclear energy be a crucial part of that mix a the only option capable of produce the quantity of energy require . nuclear power be actually more efficient than any other power source : a gram of uranium 235 contains a much energy a four ton of coal 3 . 
counterpoint : nuclear power be no good place to deliver the amount of energy require . there be an unrealistic focus on nuclear power a a magical solution to climate change . despite increase demand the amount of electricity be generate by nuclear be project to fall not rise . the share of nuclear energy will decrease from 30 to 25 in electricity generation by 2020 . according to current projection , the nuclear generation capacity in the eu would fall by as much a 33 gwe by 2020 ; this fall would mostly have to be meet by dirty power plant use gas , or particularly coal 1 . 
point : in many sens nuclear energy be the cleanest of renewables . it do not produce emission such a co2 and greenhouse gas , which be harmful to the population and the environment . roughly 700 million metric ton of co2 emission be avoid each year in the united states by generate electricity from nuclear power rather than some other source ; accord to the u . s . department of energy , that be nearly equivalent to the co2 release from all u . s . passenger car 1 . 
counterpoint : nuclear power plant be not much of an improvement over conventional coal burn power plant despite claim that nuclear be the 'clean air energy . ' uranium mining , milling , leeching , plant construction and decommission all produce substantial amount of greenhouse gas . taking into account the carbon equivalent emission associate with the entire nuclear life cycle , not just the nuclear fission itself , nuclear plant contribute significantly to climate change and will contribute even more a stockpile of high grade uranium be depleted1 . 
point : in addition , the use of nuclear power reduce our foreign energy dependency . the european union be a net importer for energy , and a such be reliant on russia and norway , predominantly , for oil and gas supply . events such a the dispute between russia and the ukraine over gas supply demonstrate that the eu's energy can easily be disrupt by political situation outside it control1 . it also mean that the eu could be draw into dispute between russia and neighbouring country because it have a vested interest in the region . this could set a dangerous precedent , where the eu could be intimidate by russia , because the eu relies so heavily on russian gas . building more nuclear power station would ensure a more secure supply of energy , thereby avoid the potential for energy supply to become a politically charge issue on an international scale . 
counterpoint : there be almost always one renewable resource that a give country can exploit with sufficient investment ; tide for island , the sun for equatorial country , hot rock for volcanic region . any give country can in principle become self sufficient in term of renewable energy . the global distribution of uranium be hugely uneven much more so than fossil fuel and the use of nuclear power therefore give country with uranium deposit disproportionate economic power . kazakhstan become the world's number one supplier of uranium in 2009 , and other major producer such a russia , namibia , niger and uzbekistan may not be reliable1 . it be far from inconceivable that uranium could be subject to the same kind of monopoly that the opec organisation of petroleum exporting countries place on oil .
