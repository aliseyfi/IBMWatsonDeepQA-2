point : in extreme case , in which peaceful and democratic method have be exhaust , it be legitimate and justified to resort to terror . in case of repression and suffering , with an implacably oppressive state and no obvious possibility of international relief , it be sometimes necessary to resort to violence to defend one s people and pursue one s cause . 
counterpoint : terrorism be never justify . peaceful and democratic mean must always be use . if this cannot happen inside the state , there be international court such a the international criminal court in the the hague , which handle case such a war crime and oppression . even when democratic right be deny , non violent protest be the only moral action . and in the most extreme case , in which subject population be weak and vulnerable to reprisal from the attacked state , it be especially important for group not to resort to terror . terrorism merely exacerbate a situation , and create a cycle of violence and suffering . 
point : in some case , terrorism can result in the acknowledgement of certain group . therefore , terrorism be justify by it success in achieve result when peaceful mean have fail . in many country terrorist have succeed in bring government to negotiate with them and make concession to them . where government have not be willing to concede to rational argument and peaceful protest , terrorism can compel recognition of a cause . nelson mandela move from terrorist to president . in many other country we see this trend too in israel , northern ireland , in sri lanka , and in the oslo peace process that lead to the creation of the palestinian authority . 1 
counterpoint : terrorism , in the long term , have far less chance of success than other , peaceful mean . it antagonise and anger the community that it target . it polarise opinion and make it more difficult for moderate on both side to prevail and compromise . a lasting and peaceful settlement can only be win with the freely give consent of both party to a conflict or disagreement . the example give in this argument be of country and area that still counter much instability , and in country such a israel and palestine a sustainable peaceful solution still seem far away . moreover , the oslo peace process be the result of long term , diplomatic effort on an international scale , and terrorism do not seem to have contribute directly to this process . 
point : terrorism can raise the profile of a neglected cause . the hi jackings of the 1970s and 1980s brought publicity to the palestinian cause , help to bring it to the attention of the world . 1 states can use their wealth and medium to put across their side of the story ; their opponent do not have these resource and perhaps need to resort to terrorism to publicise their cause . in this way , limited and focused use of violence can have a dramatic international impact . 
counterpoint : not all attention that follow terrorism be positive . after the 9 11 attack , aid worker in afghanistan be force to cut off food supply in the country , even though 7 to 8 million civilian be dependent on them . 1 the kind of terrorist attack that attract the most attention be the violent one , and they be likely to be meet with reaction of disgust and grief . this mean that the international community be less likely to sympathize with their cause , which result in less support . 
point : the definition of terrorism depend very much upon your point of view the proposition do not need to defend every atrocity against innocent civilian to argue that terrorism be sometimes justified . a broad definition would say terrorism be the use of violence for political end by any group which break the geneva conventions which govern action between army in wartime or ignores generally accept concept of human right . under such a broad definition , state and their armed force could be accuse of terrorism . so could many resistance group in wartime or freedom fighter struggle against dictatorship , as well a participant in civil war all irregular group outside the scope of the geneva conventions . 
counterpoint : states who ignore the geneva conventions , for example by mistreat prisoner or deliberately attack civilian target , be guilty of terrorism and this cannot be justify . nor be the conventions only applicable to warfare between sovereign state their principle can be clearly apply in other kind of conflict and use to distinguish between legitimate military struggle and indefensible terrorism . 
point : actions can only be justify by their outcome , and if the outcome of an act of terror be an overall increase of justice , freedom and welfare , this action be therefore legitimate . many people around the world suffer on a daily basis from poverty , injustice and violence . generally , these people do not choose to suffer , nor be it a result of their action ; therefore it can be see a a logical conclusion that it be a good thing that this suffering be diminish . however , authority might not always agree to redistribution or an acknowledgement of right , and more drastic measure be need to obtain the goal . if , in this case , the use of act of terror be need to obtain great good such a justice and equality , and this would mean that on balance , more people would gain more utility , the action would be justify . in this way , terrorism can be see a an effective weapon in a revolutionary struggle that result in progression . a very current example be the terrorist attack in several middle eastern country that have lead to the arab spring , such a the attack on the yemen president ali abdullah saleh . 1 
counterpoint : the end do not justify the mean . even in case of oppression , it be well to persecute your interest through non violent and legal mean . there may be case where only an act of terror will lead to a direct improvement of overall utility , but these case be very rare . often terrorist attack be perform by extremist group who have view that differ from the majority of the community they claim to represent . most people prefer non violent mean , and the repercussion of violent terrorist act , such a the invasion of afghanistan to eradicate the taliban , will largely worsen the position of the marginalize in society .
