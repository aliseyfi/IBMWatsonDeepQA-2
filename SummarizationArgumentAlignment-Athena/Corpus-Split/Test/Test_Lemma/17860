point : terrorists be engage in a war like any other : they unite a a political actor to undertake military action in favour of a specific cause . the fact that they do not represent one individual nation and that they be not at war with a specific list of state do not undermine this : al qaeda , for example , have clear goal include eliminate american influence within muslim nation , destroy israel and re establish the caliphate blanchard , 2007 . the fact that we may not view these cause a worthy or legitimate be irrelevant : we do not assess the merit or legitimacy of a conflict between state before decide whether to apply the geneva convention . it should therefore apply equally to soldier and terrorist . the geneva conventions be form to ensure that future war would not result in the barbarity and wanton violence that mire world war ii ; to deny it to terrorist would risk the undermining of norm that have develop to restrain warfare . if we don t treat terrorist a prisoner of war therefore , we risk a return to the barbarity of warfare in the first half of the 20th century . 
counterpoint : terrorists be not engage in a war . their action be aim at destruction of civil society and of nation across the globe . the geneva conventions exist to control war between nation in a way which respect human dignity and minimises long term harm . wars between nation have a foreseeable end , and the convention be an important mean of aid reconciliation and cooperation in the future : it be hard to build a relationship with a state which have brutally torture your soldier upon capture . however , a war against terrorist will often have no end : it be inconceivable , for example , either that al qaeda will successfully achieve the reestablishment of the caliphate or that the west will quash all terrorist activity . reconciliation and future cooperation be meaningless here . 
point : even if we think the terrorist cause be illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity . there be certain act , such a torture , to which no individual should be subject , regardless of their own behaviour . the geneva convention be about universal respect for human dignity international committee of the red cross , 1949 , not merely for those who show it in return . civilised nation can and should be expect to act in a humane manner , regardless of the barbarity of their adversary . only by act in such a manner can state prove the superiority of their own humanity . 
counterpoint : there be no moral duty to respect the humanity of terrorist . terrorists themselves do not respect human right . by attack civilian , they breach the term of the geneva conventions and international human right law . they do not deserve to be protect by the law of war because they do not behave like a military organisation . if they do not comply with the law of war there be no reason why they should enjoy the benefit of the geneva conventions when they be detain . 
point : poor treatment affirms terrorist ideology : regardless of what be morally right , it would be beneficial to treat terrorist in the way prescribe by the convention . terrorist ideology be often predicate on the behaviour of those country against which it be target . treating captured terrorist or terror suspect in a way that ignore their human dignity only reinforce negative perception of the west and encourage the radicalization of the youth mccarthy , 2007 . in addition , such behaviour can be use to justify terrorist action to less radicalised member of certain community . 
counterpoint : poor treatment be not a significant recruitment tool : whilst some people may be encourage to join terrorist group a a result of such behaviour , those who be outrage by human right abuse in this context should be equally concern about the violation of human right which occur when a terrorist detonate a bomb , or fly into a building , kill large number of innocent civilian . the ideology invoked exist independently of the way in which suspect be treat and indoctrination with such belief be the real tool in the recruitment process . 
point : harsh interrogation of captive have not be show to be effective white , 2007 . those who be prepare to die to advance their cause be unlikely to yield information , no matter how much they be threaten or torture . where captive do provide information , they often state simply what they think that the interrogator want to hear , rather than anything that be true mazzetti , 2007 . in addition , give the cellular nature of many terrorist organisation , those capture often have very little useful information to begin with . even if they have be involve in a plot , they may only have information about a very small part of that plot . furthermore , win the trust of prisoner can lead to more effective information than the use of torture . 
counterpoint : harsh interrogation be indeed necessary , due in part to the unique efficacy of harsh interrogation in deal with the new threat . the interrogation of a terrorist be qualitatively different to that of a soldier , due to the nature of terrorist attack and the importance of information in their prevention . michael hayden , former director of the cia , argue that there be no other way for the cia to have acquire information from them , give their character and give their commitment to what it be they do martinez , 2009 . the effectiveness of harsh interrogation may vary , but an absolute prohibition base on the few exception would be too high a price to pay . protecting civilian life must come before maintain any moral high ground . 
point : the united nations , a the institution that form and maintain the geneva conventions and other restriction on warfare , be able to use it structure to punish state that do not adhere to it protocol . the international criminal court , establish by the rome statute of 1998 , be able to prosecute those specific person who be charge with war crime . such defendant , if convict , can be order to pay the victim . furthermore , the international court of justice be able to bring case against specific state that be clearly identify a have break the protocol of war . as such , the united nations be both legally and institutionally capable of ensure that the dictate of the geneva conventions be upheld , specifically the right of a combatant capture in a conflict zone to be grant prisoner of war status . while this would provide a degree of protection for captured terrorist , it also mean that terrorist organization be subject to standard of conduct in war . making them subject to the geneva conventions would uphold an incentive of restraint which might sometimes influence their conduct . 
counterpoint : the united nation have the potential to punish party that do not abide by it protocol , include the geneva conventions . however , it ability to do so be limited even when it come to state since that power be itself grant by it member state . for example , the international criminal court be only able to bring case which the security council approve . therefore , the contemporary target of terrorist , most notably the united states and the united kingdom , be inevitably go to veto any proposition to persecute themselves for violate the geneva conventions . the circular process of ask a state whether it will approve the prosecution of itself betray the absurdity of the united nations a an institution enforce the protocol of war . as for the behaviour of terrorist group , their member be subject to prosecution for action equivalent to war crime whether or not they be subject to the geneva conventions .
