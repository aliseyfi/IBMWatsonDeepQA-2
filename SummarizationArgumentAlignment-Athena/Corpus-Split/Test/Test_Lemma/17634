point : the ideal of a white christmas also speak to the old pagan festival . the winter solstice yule , saturnalia be a time of hope in the cold and darkness , a night stop get longer and people look for the promise of new birth in springtime . the christian church recognize the power of exist winter festival and choose december 25th for their own nativity celebration . people still feel a need to move in time with the season , and snow represent winter at it most extreme . for these reason the dream of a white christmas satisfy a need deep within u . 
counterpoint : if the idea of a white christmas be pagan then we should drop it . we be not pagan anymore and we have a modern understanding of the season . if the festival be all about the short day , then much of the world's population would be leave out . everyone in the southern hemisphere would have to celebrate the festival in june . those near the equator would never get to celebrate at all . christmas should unite humanity , not split it apart . 
point : we all love the traditional white christmas . when we think of christmas we see snowy scene , with people skate and sledging , and child make snowball and snowman . later the family gather inside around a warm fire to celebrate . this be the sort of christmas show on greeting card and celebrate in so many song for example , white christmas , jingle bells , frosty the snowman , walking in a winter wonderland , etc . . it isn't a proper christmas without snow . the interest in snowy christmases have it origin in the colder climate of the period 1550 1850 when britain be in the grip of a little ice age 2 that way , the traditional image be create . 
counterpoint : a white christmas be not traditional . even in northern country such a great britain snow have always be very rare in december it be much more likely to fall later in the winter . it s all charles dickens fault he grow up in the unusually snowy 1810s , and later write snowy scene into his popular christmas story , such a a christmas carol . even in the 19th century , snow at christmas be uncommon , and in many place today it be quite rare western europe , most of the usa or impossible southern hemisphere country like australia . it be well to enjoy christmas for what it be rather than feel sorry every year that it doesn t live up to some storybook picture . 
point : for most people christmas today be not about a religious festival , but about consumption , greed and shopping . wishing for a snowy white christmas be about turn the clock back to a time when life be simpler . instead of focus on get present , get fat and get drunk , a white christmas be something money can't buy . it symbolize time with family , play outdoors in the snow , make your own entertainment and enjoy the wonder of nature . who wouldn't prefer a christmas like that ? 
counterpoint : it might suit the non religious people who run much of the medium to say that , but it strip christmas of all real meaning . the truth be that anyone can celebrate christ's birth at christmas , whether they be in snowy lapland , summery australia or tropical africa . christmas have nothing to do with snow ; it be the celebration of jesus christ's birth in a bethlehem stable . snow be not mention in the bible story and it be very , very rare in bethlehem . seeing the holiday a just a snowy winter festival be a way of take christ out of christmas .
