point : domestic intelligence be very important to the national security and to the safety of the public . domestic intelligence be imperative in prevent terrorist attack on the country when terrorist be a likely to be native a foreigner , for example the 7 7 bomber in britain be all native . 1 in order for a domestic intelligence organization to be effective , it organizational discretion must be limit by establish clear legislation that be not secret , on the focus , limit , and technique of domestic intelligence . 
counterpoint : even if it be protect live the scale of the intelligence gathering be undemocratic . by allow interception , widespread tracking of public record , unfair legal treatment , we erase the trust between citizen and the government in return for very occasionally prevent a terrorist attack . as show by 7 7 terrorist still get through despite intelligence even when the bomber have already be notice . 1 when all your library patron can be seize and all your browsing log check just on a claim that they be relevant to intelligence information , a initially happen under the patriot act , too much liberty be be give up in the name of very little extra security . 2 
point : domestic intelligence do require the collection of information , but this be not fundamentally different from a standard police investigation . the difference be minor when we have national security at stake . furthermore , the right , duty and power of a domestic intelligence service be carefully restrict by law . for example , under dutch law , the general intelligence and security service aivd be only allow to wiretap someone after permission grant by the minister of interior affairs the uk situation be very similar . 1 generally speaking , for every surveillance action the domestic intelligence can take , it need to weigh whether the action satisfy the principle of proportionality and subsidiarity , mean that the invasiveness of a surveillance method should be proportional to the risk the person pose , and that the method chosen should be the least invasive of all possible method . 
counterpoint : for intelligence to be effective , the government will need to collect personal information , like bank transaction , email , phone record , and more , without the citizen in question knowing this . however , democracy work on the assumption that each citizen have a private sphere , separate from the public sphere , of private information , thought and opinion , and that the citizen decides who to let into that sphere . put differently , the citizen have control over when to release private information , and when not . investigating them without their knowledge mean take away that control , and that be a violation of the right to privacy . police investigation , on the other hand , be legitimate and not invasive of democracy the police be generally oblige to inform a citizen when he or she be subject to a criminal investigation , and can generally only investigate a citizen without their knowledge after seek specific permission from the judiciary , not just by a minister sign off a whole batch of request a it s do with domestic intelligence . 
point : even if not every citizen can control exactly what the intelligence service do , there be sufficient political and judicial control . an example of this be a recent case involve the dutch aivd , which start wiretapping journalist after they have find a source within the aivd to leak about the run up to the iraq war . the journalist be wiretapped but when the case come to court , the court judge that the aivd be in error , should stop harass the journalist , and must delete the file on the journalist immediately . such case show that the intelligence agency , and those involve domestically in particular , have judicial and political oversight to make sure they remain within bound . 1 democracy be therefore not threaten a there be democratic oversight . 
counterpoint : the aivd example show exactly that judicial and political control be not enough : the judicial control be control after the fact , so it didn t prevent the aivd from listen in to journalist conversation in the first place . moreover , a regulatory committee judge that the minister of internal affairs , who be suppose to be the a priori control , have give permission too easily , which be to be expect when a minister face a lot of request like this , and have to decide in between the regular work of actually govern . 1 it be the lack of initial oversight which be anti democratic , citizen expect their government and court to prevent the intelligence agency from infringe on privacy not simply demand an apology later when the intelligence agency be find out . how many more case be there which be not catch ? 
point : domestic intelligence service be the only organization that be capable of perform counterintelligence . they have the capacity and the authority to detect foreign spy in the national jurisdiction , and experience with local surveillance and investigation . part of the job of domestic intelligence be to maintain a network of informer and agent , and this can be use to find and track foreign intelligence service on a mission these function can t be easily perform by the military or foreign intelligence so an independent domestic intelligence agency be necessary . 
counterpoint : the military or foreign intelligence or just a able to conduct counterintelligence , because the potential target for foreign intelligence service be well know . but even if a domestic intelligence service be best place for counter intelligence , this be just an argument for limit their function to counter intelligence , where they win t harm citizen s privacy a much . the argument above deal with the other work a domestic intelligence do , and that work be illegitimate .
