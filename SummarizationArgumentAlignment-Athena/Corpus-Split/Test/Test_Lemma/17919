point : human history be one of exploration . since the early day of homo sapiens , people have strive to look beyond the horizon , to see what be out there . it be this impetus that lead human out of the small corner of africa where the specie be bear , to see new place , to find new fertile land to explore . it be this impetus also that lead the first european explorer to traverse the great water of the atlantic ocean in search of new trade route , brave the very real risk of storm , disease , piracy , and fatal disorientation , as well a the perceived risk of sea serpent and other monster await unwary traveler . when the surface of the world be finally map , people set their sight on exploration of the sea floor , to climb the high mountain , and finally to reach the star themselves , all because they be challenge , unknown to be make know . 1 mankind s place be among the star . simply peruse picture of space send back by unthinking , unfeeling robot would never be enough to satisfy humanity s curiosity . governments should not try to slow man s progress to the star but should promote and fund it , for to do otherwise be to end part of what it be to be human . 
counterpoint : curiosity and the will to explore certainly be a fundamental part of the human condition . but the human body have natural limitation that technology cannot overcome . while artifice can go a long way to make place suitable for the frail human form , it can only go so far . manned space flight be extremely expensive , cost the us government , the primary investor in space technology ten of billion of dollar every year , yet there remain no clear plan for human to return to the moon , let alone mars and the rest of the solar system . 1 exploration beyond the solar system remain a pipe dream . the law of physic likewise seem to make the possibility of human exploration beyond the solar system nigh impossible . other star be simply too far away for a human to reach . the reality simply be that manned space flight be too costly and will likely never find application beyond sol . 
point : space exploration and research have result many major advance in science and technology . everything from velcro to more efficient and powerful computer have come out of the space program . many of these development arise due to the focus on the human element of space travel ; scientist have to focus on the very real challenge of get human into space and back home safely . 1 furthermore , there be some experiment that can only be conduct in space and that require the dexterity and problem solve skill of human . while robot be very good at carry out pre design program and collect data , their ability to think critically and engage in problem solving be quite limited . in order to get the most of space travel and exploration , human must be present to add their critical thinking and physical capacity to mission . for technology to continue to develop through the space program the paradigm of exploration must be maintain . this can only be do through manned space flight . 
counterpoint : humans be more liability than asset when it come to space travel . while human can think outside the box more readily than machine , development in cognitive science and computer design have result in ever more competent computer that be gain more and more the ability to solve problem on their own . furthermore , human be physically fragile ; in the event of even slight damage to a spacecraft , all human on board could be kill . they be also susceptible to health risk in the form of radiation damage and muscle and bone loss due to the zero gravity condition of space . 1 unmanned ship be far more capable of survive the danger of space , and of complete mission successfully . 
point : people do not get excite when they see robot launch into space ; there be no romance or adventure in a computer attach to a rocket . to enflame people s imagination and enthusiasm for space travel , real life astronaut must be involve . furthermore , it be hard for people around the world to develop a sense of connection to an unmanned space flight . manned mission , however , can become ambassador of all humanity . in no endeavor have scientist from around the world more readily work together than in the development of the international space station and other space relate enterprise . looking beyond the earth serve to unite humanity in a way nothing else can . 1 when the apollo astronaut first transmit image of the earth back to the wait mass , the sight of that tiny blue white marble suspend in the vast void profoundly change the way many people view themselves . there be for the first time a sense of oneness , of citizenship of this island earth . in the exploration of space , astronaut be not just citizen of their home country , but be emissary of the entire human race . in this way space exploration actually give mankind a transcendent purpose , promote peace and understanding among nation that no amount of conventional diplomacy can create . 
counterpoint : while unmanned space exploration be not as romantic a manned space flight , it be more functional . exploring space be extremely expensive and government have to consider the practicality of exploration more than the glamour . scientifically , little be gain by manned flight over unmanned flight . in term of increase interest in space flight , it be questionable whether state encourage interest in space exploration be the best thing at all . they could simply use space exploration , especially excite man voyage , a mean of distract public attention from domestic problem . it be well for people to be focus on life on this planet than on the mystery of space . 
point : the earth have suffer a number of catastrophic event in it history . the galaxy be permeate with giant meteor like the one that strike the earth 16 million year ago , which succeed in wipe out the dinosaur and precipitate an ice age . 1 other cosmic risk exist as well , such a the threat of deadly radioactive wave give off by supernova that can span the gulf between star and scorch planet many light year away . likewise , risk closer to home could prove equally destructive . intense solar flair from our sun could scorch a whole side of the planet . while all these occurrence be very rare , they remain possibility , and should any of them ever occur , it could prove the end of humanity , and even life on earth . in order to guarantee the survival of the human race , man space flight must be make viable . one day it may prove necessary to leave this cradle of life in pursuit of a new home , and it would be wise to invest in develop the technology to do so rather than to wait until it be too late and only be able to watch a mankind s doom arrive . 
counterpoint : the probability of any cosmic collision or other destructive event be extremely low and not worth think about . in any event , man space flight would not be viable for the purpose of save humanity from a die earth for many year , if ever . governments and people should focus their attention on develop this planet , rather than worry too much about find new one to inhabit .
