point : water would ideally be a universally accessible and affordable substance , but government cannot necessarily be trust to provide water to all of their citizen . 90 of water be publicly provide , yet 1 billion people don't have water1 . clearly this isn't work . some government be negligent , and there need to be a solution to give citizen access to clean water without government provision . this problem have only be exacerbate by the shrink budget of most country due to the economic crisis of 2009 . current regime in develop country often provide a state subsidy to the rich , with water provide to middle class area and wealthy farmer at a fraction of it true cost , while poor area have no supply at all2 . many government be unfair to the poor , but private provider have no reason to pick favorite . the poor be already pay for their water , either directly to entrepreneur who carry it in tub and can up to the shanty town , or with their time a they spend a large proportion of the family's labor fetch poor quality water from mile away3 . water privatization will charge for water , however it will be more fair to the poor and provide them with more option to access water that the government be not provide . it be difficult to force government to improve water access , but company and public private partnerships where private company pay for most of the infrastructure , but partner with public entity can be use to achieve this goal . 1 economist 2003 , private passions , economist magazine , accessed july 11 , 2011 4 2 asian water supplies chapter 11 , tariffs , subsidies , and development funding , accessed july 11 , 2011 5 3 bosch , christophe , hommann , kirsten , rubio , gloria m . , sadoff , claudia and travers , lee 2001 , water , sanitation and poverty , intussen , accessed july 11 , 2011 6 
counterpoint : governments can be push to take action to provide their people with water . water be such an important part of life that it be unlikely that a government can ignore the issue , if it people do not have access to clean water . the world bank often tie loan to development in country include improving water access , and the same stipulation can be associate with aid from individual countries1 . there be therefore way of work with government and it be not necessary to look to private company to usurp them . 
point : the goal of the united nations be to provide more people with clean water ; it be irrelevant who provide it as long a it become available to more of the world's population . private public partnership have prove themselves successful in improve water access around the world . the world bank conduct a study that estimate that since 1990 , ppps have provide piped water to 24 million people1 . many public utility company need to start ration water because of a lack of service continuity . most poor area have low pressure and poor pipe infrastructure , and the people have little money to afford well and pump that could address the issue that come with rationing1 . for this reason the poor be disproportionately affect by ration . ppps have be successful in reduce these problem . for example , colombian private company have improve service continuity in many city and towns1 . additionally , clean , quality water must be provide to people , because of the potentially serious consequence of unhealthy water . the desire to make a profit drive company into remote area and improves water access for the poor and therefore be a viable option for address current water concern . 
counterpoint : companies only serve their shareholder and profit . as a result , if a rural a village only have a handful of poor resident , a supply company will probably not build the necessary infrastructure to provide it with water , because the likelihood of the company receive a return on their investment be low . since all people need water , and company have no incentive to provide water to everyone only those who pay privatization do not necessarily improve access to water for those in the dire need . 
point : as population be increase , demand for water be increase , but the water available be become scarcer . for that reason , use water effectively be integral to sustainably improve access to water around the world . water simply cannot continue to be waste . companies want to be profitable and that mean operating at the high efficiency . the world bank find that , in western africa , brazil , colombia , morocco , and eastern manila , private company have successfully reduce water loss . in some case , private company have reduce non revenue water to just 15 , which be comparable to developed country utility , which be generally very efficient . 1 it be essential that efficiency be reach , and private company have be show to improve efficiency through conserve water resource while public company generally lose efficiency through wasted water . they have also improve labor productivity since manager be try to run a profitable company and employee need to be effective . often public utility company be wasteful and unproductive , which expend valuable resource and actually reduce the number of people water be be make accessible to . private company , on the other hand , have tool and expertise for building effectively , which be often unavailable to government . for example , company in the niger delta be able to get supply for a fraction of the price that the government paid1 . 160 million people have be serve by public private project in the last 15 year and 50 million of them about one third be consider successful1 . considering the challenge to provide water , a 1 3 success rate be significant and be the foundation for further improvement . because efficiency lower the price of water , save more water to be distribute , and prevents waste a valuable resource , privatization be a viable solution . 
counterpoint : efficiency be not exclusive to private company and industry . it be not impossible for public utility to be effective . both private and public utility have their drawback , but with government oversight and productivity incentive , public utility can perform with efficiency . this have be prove to be the case , a utility in many developed country work just fine . most americans be in fact serve by publicly own utilities1 . therefore public do not mean inefficient . 
point : water be a resource subject to supply and demand , and so should be treat a an economic good . it may fall freely from the sky , but it have to be collect , manage , process and supply through an expensive system of reservoir , channel , processing plant and pipe . dirty water and human waste also have to be remove and treat in sanitation system . we pay for food , and shelter , which be both necessary for life , so it be perfectly morally acceptable to pay for water . problems of water supply need to be address with huge investment , particularly in the developing world where many people have no access to decent fresh water . even in the developed world , much water up to 50 in canada be waste through leak in pipe and age infrastructure . the public sector have fail to provide the money for this investment so private involvement be essential . for this investment to be attractive to the private sector , water company must be allow to make a profit through realistic water charge that reflect the cost of supply . issues of quality , equity and environmental standard can be handle through effective regulation . 
counterpoint : yes we do pay for different utility and necessary resource , however if they be publicly own , the government can subsidize those cost for low income citizen who cannot afford the full price . when government own the utility that provide water , they can better control the price that the poor have to pay and thus address of affordability . additionally , just because we pay for other utility do not justify have to pay for the most necessary resource to life .
