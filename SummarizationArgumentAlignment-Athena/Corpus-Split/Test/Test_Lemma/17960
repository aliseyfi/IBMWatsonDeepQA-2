point : protecting endanger specie help protect human : humans actually benefit in a large number of way from the protection of endanger specie and thus continue biodiversity . firstly , the diversity of life and live system be consider by many scientist to be a necessary condition for human development . we live in a world build on a carefully balance ecosystem in which all specie play a role , and the removal of specie from this can cause negative consequence for the whole ecosystem , include human . 1 there be also the potential for almost any specie to hold currently unknown future benefit to human through product they could provide . one example of this be the scrub mint , an endanger plant specie which have be find to contain an anti fungal agent and a natural insecticide , and thus hold great potential for use that benefit human . 2 endangered specie have also be know to hold the key to medical breakthrough which save human life . one example of this be the pacific yew a tree specie which become the source of taxol , one of the most potent anticancer compound ever discover . 3 biodiversity also help protect human in that different species' differ reaction to ecological problem may in fact act a a kind of 'early warning' system of develop problem which may one day negatively affect people . this be the case with the now ban dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt pesticide , a the deterioration of the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon through their exposure to ddt in fact alert human to the potential health hazard of this pesticide , not just to animal but also to human . 4 thus the preservation of endangered specie help to protect human , a this mean plant and animal continue to play their specific role in the world's ecosystem which humans rely on , can act a an 'early warning' for problem which may affect human , and may hold the key to scientific and medical breakthrough which can greatly benefit humanity . al this could be lose through the careless extinction of plant and animal specie . 
counterpoint : this argument fail to take into account the cost of protect endanger specie and weigh them against the potential harm of them become extinct . in a world where only 5 of plant specie have be survey for their potential medicinal value , 1 this mean protect the survival of the other 95 purely for the potential value that only a fraction of them may possess . all of this mean deny development human development now , by not open area up for agriculture or not construct housing . these be very real cost which impact upon peoples' life , and may even outweigh those scientific and medical advance which may or may not be find in currently endanger specie . 
point : an environment with a great diversity of plant and animal specie in it can act a a source for art and entertainment , enrich the life of human . thus the preservation of endangered specie be an important part of ensure this diversity continue to exist so people and enjoy and be inspire by the many varied kind of life on this earth . a good example of this be the re introduction of the grey wolf into yellowstone park in the united states where it have previously become extinct due to human action , which add to the biodiversity of the region and cause a great influx of tourist into the park . 1 people enjoy be surround by different kind of nature , and so protecting endangered specie be an important part of protect human enjoyment . 
counterpoint : the problem with this argument be that it prioritize the enjoyment of some individual over others with no real justification . the grey wolf , for example , go extinct in the yellowstone region in the first place because human consider it a pest and a threat to livestock and so hunt it to extinction . clearly these people didn't enjoy the 'diversity' the grey wolf provide . we don't usually give something the force of law regard animal just because some people enjoy it . for example , the uk have now ban fox hunt even though a great many people find it to be a source of pleasure and recreation . 1 if everyone desire the protection of all endanger specie , there would be no need for this law , but the fact that a law be need to restrain human action show that not everyone 'enjoys' this biodiversity in the same way . 
point : human moral responsibility to other specie : humans be unique and unprecedented in life on earth in that their intelligence and sentience far surpass that of any other specie ever know to have exist . humans be not simply force to kill or ignore other specie by instinct alone , a other specie be , but rather can make a variety of choice base not only on information but on moral ground . thus with our great power come a great responsibility to act in a moral fashion , and not simply to prioritize our own human good over that of other specie . the ability of animal specie , for example , to feel pain and suffering be something we should consider and try to avoid , a we recognise that pain be bad for ourselves , and thus must be bad for animal as well . similarly if we believe our own survival be a good thing , we should recognise that the survival of other specie be also a moral good , and act accordingly to protect endangered specie . 
counterpoint : superior human intellect and sentience only mean that we should make sure we consider the moral ramification of our action , not that we should take any particular action a a result . it be entirely in keep with this for u to conclude that human life and enjoyment be more important than animal life and specie survival , and so for u to decide not to protect endanger specie when this a it by definition always will infringe upon human benefit and enjoyment . 
point : human moral responsibility to future generation : species extinction be an irrevocable occurrence . outside of the film 'jurassic park' , extinct specie cannot be summon back from the grave once human action have put them there . this mean that when a current generation make the decision not to protect an endangered specie and thus allow human action to drive it to extinction , this deny future generation the ability to make up their own mind about the pro and con of the survival of that endanger specie , especially consider that they might want that specie to exist for the aforementioned scientific , medical , aesthetic or moral reason . for example , there be a great modern day interest in the dodo specie of bird which be hunt to extinction in mauritius in the 17th century . 1 the opinion of many in the modern world today be one of regret at the bird's extinction and that it should have be protect , but a lack of consideration of the wish of future generation in the 17th century have mean that the human of the 21st century be deny the ability to decide on the value of this species themselves . because we place a moral value on the ability of human to make decision a we consider it to be a good thing when we ourselves have this ability we should recognise that the possibly differ opinion of future generation should constrain our choice somewhat , and we should protect endangered specie so that future generation can decide for themselves regard their value . 
counterpoint : by this argument , no human generation could ever decide that protect a specie be more trouble than it worth and so let it become extinct , a there would always be the theoretical possibility of a future generation that might regret this choice . every choice we make a a generation constrains and widen the choice available to future generation . if we protect endanger specie and therefore limit agricultural and housing land to protect their environment we deny future generation more plentiful food supply and good housing . we may even deny the existence of more human in the future by not have enough food to fee a population which could grow faster if the food supply be great . we cannot allow the remote possibility of future regret to cause u to take action which a great many people will 'regret' in the present .
