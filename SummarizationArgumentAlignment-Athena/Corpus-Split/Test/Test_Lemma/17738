point : if communication between an attorney and their client be confidential , then it allow for lie to be put forward to the court in order to defend someone who be guilty . in the case of a criminal matter , it could mean that even though a defendant have state they be guilty to their attorney , they will not be find to be guilty . every attorney want to win their case , and if they be likely to conceal the confession of their client if it mean their client will be release . as the communication be confidential , such confession will not be inform to the court and the attorney would not be expose for their lie . the confidential nature of the communication between attorney and client open the possibility for a system of justice base upon lie . this be not just and so the attorney client privilege should be abolish . 
counterpoint : it be a breach of a fundamental rule of an attorney's professional conduct rule to lie to the court . in england and wales the risk of attorney's lying have be cater for by the rule 11 . 01 of the solicitors' code of conduct . this rule make it a serious breach of the conduct rule to lie to or knowingly deceive the court ; a witness statement and police interview be present in court a evidence these be also include . 1 this mean that a solicitor be not allow to put forward or allow to be put forward any information to be adduce to the court which be incorrect . the consequence for a solicitor be high they be liable to have their professional license revoke . given the high consequence , a solicitor would not be willing to risk it and will therefore not be willing to lie for their client to the court . 
point : a system of just law be not base on opinion or ideology . it be about find evidence and use that evidence to prove or disprove either to 'beyond reasonable doubt' for criminal case or 'on the balance of probabilities' for civil and commercial matter . the burden be on the importance of the evidence . it do not make sense for a legal system to on one hand place so much emphasis on evidence and lock away document which will contain a vast array of empirical evidence with the other . instead , attorney client privilege should be abolish and all evidence should be in justice domain in order to ensure that the law achieve a just result . 
counterpoint : if it be the case that legal advice be not privilege people would not tell their attorney the full truth and therefore such evidence would not exist anyway . the removal of attorney client privilege would only remove such evidence from the forum . this would lead to a far distorted system whereby attorneys be argue upon the false representation make to them by their client . this provide even less evidence of truth than a system which include attorney client privilege . 
point : with the attorney client privilege in place , there be an excessive burden on the solicitor to cope with any information their client may give to them on a confidential basis . this mean they have to deal with the information alone . this be an excessive moral burden for any individual to have and should not be justify on the basis that a solicitor be there to advance the interest of their client . it should not be the solicitor role to deal with moral conflict alone . 
counterpoint : the privilege that subsist between solicitor and their client be well document . therefore , when people go about become solicitor they go into it know the potential moral pitfall . having enter the career they accept the moral burden and should seek to comply with the solicitors code of conduct . in addition , the moral burden be mitigate by those such rule . it be state that in exceptional circumstance , situation involve child or the potential serious bodily harm on any individual the duty of confidentiality can be depart from . 
point : one of the principle behind allow communication between a solicitor and their client to be privilege be that a solicitor be independent of their client and so will not breach law themselves in order to attain their client objective . however , after the recession of 2008 and the legal services act 2007 the position of in house lawyer be more prevalent 1 . in house lawyer be not financially independent . they be in fact employee of their 'client' . this eradicate the principle behind client attorney privilege and therefore the privilege itself be now irrelevant and should be eradicate . 
counterpoint : this do not mean that client attorney privilege should be do away with altogether . when it come to european law and their investigation under the treaty of lisbon for uncompetitive practice , they do not count in house lawyer communication a privileged 1 
point : most obviously it seem unnecessary for there to be attorney client privilege when the defendant s interest cannot be adversely affect . for example when the confidential information just do not incriminate the client himself but it might clear somebody else , or when the client be dead . few people will be discourage from be candid with their lawyer if there be merely the possibility that the communication may be disclose after their death . 
counterpoint : it be very unusual to have a case where it would be certain that disclosure would in no way affect the client . clients want confidentiality for a wide variety of reason , not only for reason connect to personal criminal liability . even if these confidence be not any sort of admission of criminal wrongdoing , they may nonetheless be matter that the client , for one reason or another , would not wish divulge . abolishing the privilege not only violate a person s right to privacy , but a person who know that his communication may be later reveal even after his death , or even with use immunity may well decide that it be well not to go to a lawyer in the first place in other word , lead to an access to justice problem . this become even more of a problem if the privilege may be overridden when it be in the public interest a the client be not go to know when this may be consider to be the case . better to keep the information to him herself rather than open the possibility that it may be use in the public interest
