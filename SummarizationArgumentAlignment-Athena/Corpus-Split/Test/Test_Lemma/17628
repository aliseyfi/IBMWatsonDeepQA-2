point : many scientist do not accept the conclusion of the evolutionist . people like dr . michael behe have dedicate themselves to expose the flaw in evolution and show that there be very real disagreement within the scientific community . this controversy be highlight in the many court case , book , and televise debate occur in country all over the world 1 . children deserve to hear about the controversy , and not to simply be feed one story set for them by the prevailing majority in the scientific community , even if that community cannot claim anything near consensus . until consensus be reach and indisputable proof of one theory or the other give , both side should be teach in school . 
counterpoint : there be no controversy . it be not even a matter of most scientist agree with evolution , but virtually all of them . this be demonstrate very clearly in the scientific literature , a thousand of paper be submit for peer review every year on the topic of evolution , all bolstering and uphold the theory . on the other hand , on average zero be submit support creationism , because such paper would not meet the necessary criterion of be scientific research at all . 1 some paper at best question evolution , but attack on one theory be not support of another . furthermore , the reason there be public debate and court case be that creationists seek to capitalize on the relative scientific illiteracy of the general public , know they can only win by spread disinformation , rather than face off against real scientist in the academic realm . 
point : the opinion of the scientific community with regard to fact and theory have a great propensity to change with time . once scientist adamantly maintain that the earth be flat . for century it also maintain that there be two kind of blood flow through the human body . science be not infallible and the prevailing theory be no more than the opinion currently in vogue among scholar . in light of new evidence , theory can change over time , give way to good explanation 1 . for this reason , the evolutionists' dogmatic adherence to their position in spite of contrary evidence provide by creationists be hard to understand . however , it become clear why the scientific establishment take such a confrontational position toward creationism when one considers that many eminent scientist and researcher have build their career within the paradigm of evolution , and their research often depend wholly on it acceptance . these scientist would lose their exalted position in the light of a paradigm shift in scientific understand away from evolution . it be for this reason that scientist who adhere to establish norm so often fight thing like creationism , even though they provide explanation where evolution cannot . for science to progress , these conservative impulse must be fight against , which be why it be essential that when science be taught , so be all the prevailing theory concern branch of the science , include creationism . 
counterpoint : of course scientific opinion change over time . it do so because the process of scientific enquiry require the search for new data . theories be not rigidly adhere to , but be rather accept when there be evidence for them . when evidence mount against a theory it be reject . the example cite show this very well . the idea that the world be flat be propose a a theory without proof but by the end of the classical world pliny be able to say every one agree that it have the most perfect figure . we always speak of the ball of the earth , and we admit it to be a globe bound by the pole . 1 a scholar have provide evidence of the earth be spherical . this process of change can harm some scientists' career , but it can also make others . there be no monolithic scientific establishment setting policy , deny young researcher from explore new hypothesis and avenue of inquiry . it be clear from this that creationism be not a science , because it do not change in light of new evidence , but rather dogmatically adhere to it claim in spite of evidence . science adapts to new information . creationism be stagnant and intellectual barren . 
point : nature be mark by clear design . the complexity of the human body , of ecosystem , and even of bacteria , attests to the existence of creative agency . it be impossible that such thing a , for example , interdependent specie could come to exist without the guidance of a designer . likewise , certain organism can be show to be irreducibly complex , meaning that if one be to remove any part of it , it would lose all functionality . this refute the gradualist argument of evolution , since there be no selective pressure on the organism to change when it be functionless . for example , the bacterial flagellum , the motor that power bacterial cell , lose all functionality if a single component be remove . 1 besides design , the only explanation of it development be blind chance , which be nonsensical . creationism serve to explain the various mystery of biology currently absent from the evolutionary biologists' picture of the world . the existence of complexity of the order find in the natural world be too great to envisage an origin other than complex design . 
counterpoint : there be no design in biology . people tend to anthropomorphize their environment , try to assign human like quality to animal and nature . all of the complexity of life on earth can be attribute to natural process ; life , diversity , and complexity be all the product of physical and chemical interaction and biological process . there be no mystery in the basic process . also , complexity be not at all indicative of design . in fact , evolution have be observe to occur from simple single celled organism into multi cellular organism under laboratory condition . that degree of evolution completely refute any claim about complexity require design . furthermore , there be no irreducibly complex organism . every example offer by theist of irreducible complexity have be find inaccurate . the bacterial flagellum , for example , when several key component be remove lose it functionality a a motor , but become a form of secretory system that have a separate function . 1 clearly , complexity be not indicative of a creator . 
point : creationism can be draw a an entirely reasonable scientific hypothesis , and it form a coherent theory of the origin and development of life that oppose the naturalist theory of abiogenesis and evolution . abiogenesis describe the development of life from nonliving material and evolution seek to explain the development and diversity of life through a gradual process of mutation and natural selection , yet no one have ever demonstrate either process sufficiently in the laboratory . in the case of abiogenesis , all experiment to create an environment similar to the suppose prebiotic soup whence life first sprang have result in no new life forming . in the case of evolution , evolutionists consistently fail to show the development of new kind of organisms 1 . while there be no doubt that some change occur within specie , such a the breeding of wolf into dog , it appear to happen only within certain limited bound . certainly no experiment or study have show evolution to be capable of explain such huge diversity in the world of live thing . creationism , on the other hand , offer the explanation that abiogenesis and evolution cannot . the diversity of life and it origin be rationally explicable a the product of intelligent agency . this be not a statement of religious belief , but of scientific observation . describing the nature of the designer , however , be another question all together , one that need not be answer in order to accept that there be such a designer . 
counterpoint : creationism be not science . it make no prediction that can be test in the laboratory or field . adherents of creationism do not accept it because of evidence , but rather they shape disparate fact to fit their belief . that be the opposite of scientific enquiry ; creationism begin with a conclusion and work backward . furthermore , all evidence do indeed point to a natural origin of life and it diversity . experiments be get consistently closer to create new life , and there be no evident bound to evolution . the argument of creationism be base on gap in knowledge ; rather than try to find real answer through scientific enquiry , they fill them with the designer do it . such answer be the refuge of the ignorant . 
point : society be make up of community with their own view on politics , religion , education , etc . school board should be able to set curriculum base on the desire of the public , not just on what the scientific elite command to be teach . children deserve to hear that their belief and those of their community be respect in the classroom . this be why creationism , a belief hold to vary extent in many country , should be teach in the classroom . this be particularly true in the united states , where in several state the majority of people do not accept evolution , but have instead adopt creationism , consider the evidence for the latter to be more convincing . 1 in a poll in 2009 a majority 57 say that creationism should be teach in school either without evolution or alongside it . 2 the teaching of creationism should not be teach exclusively , but should share time with other prevail theory , particularly those of evolution and abiogenesis . furthermore , evolution teach exclusively threaten religious belief , tell child they be no more than animal and lack the spark of grace give by god . it be important for social stability that school be allow to teach what communities believe to be true . 
counterpoint : schools should teach what be true . evolution be one of the most robust theory in contemporary science ; it be not the place of community to propagate lie , even if they be more in keep with their religious belief . indoctrinating child and deny them access to real science , which happen even if creationism and evolution be give equal time , be to fundamentally compromise the value of education 1 . it be an inculcation of false belief to suit a communal goal of maintain a set of belief that may not stand up to scientific scrutiny . the creationists cannot win in the scientific arena because they be not scientist so they have decide to try to subvert the political system . their goal be to undermine science and reason , and they must be stop .
