point : just a in the private sector , worker should be judge and reward on the actual result they achieve . whether it's through sheer talent or through hard work , some teacher consistently deliver good result than other teacher . those teacher be more effective and efficient at provide societal value : with the same amount of work hour they manage to more effectively educate child . it be therefore only just that their pay be differentiate accord to the result they achieve . 
counterpoint : it be unfair to reward extra achievement on top of the base level . to provide societal value from education , the base level of performance in education be already set very high . this mean that even teacher who perform at base level be already work very hard to provide the societal value we require . any difference above that already very high level be likely the result of luck and talent , both on the part of student and teacher themselves . rewarding fortunate individual for something they themselves didn't create be unjust and can only make other jealous . 
point : for decade now , teacher have be remunerate base on 'seniority' . this mean that they don't have an incentive anymore to improve themselves , no matter how motivate they be at the beginning . why try to improve yourself if you have nothing to gain from it ? adding a financial reward for exceptional performance will motivate teacher to do their utmost to develop the knowledge and talent of their pupil . 1 
counterpoint : it will not give teacher an incentive to improve their teaching . teaching be a call , not something you choose for the money . teachers be what we call 'intrinsically motivated' : they want to realize an ideal , in this case , educate and raise responsible citizen . recasting this ideal into a financial reward system actually demotivates teacher who feel the inherent value of their work now suddenly have become sully by chiefly monetary reward , which be why performance pay hasn t work in many place . 1 
point : teaching salary for year have remain steady or even decline . this make teaching a a job unattractive and so the influx of new , talented teacher halt . although the effect of fiscal change on teacher pay have be minimal control for the consequence of the financial crisis , high productivity have become central to many private sector pay scheme . as a result , the contrast between non responsive pay for teacher and high reward for talented private sector employee have become more pronounced . 
counterpoint : it will not attract more teacher . as say above , teaching be a call . many of the expected new teacher will be motivate solely by the increased pay , not by any intrinsic motivation . because they be not intrinsically motivate , they will underperform . they might leave again after a year , but in that year they will have teach a class without the requisite skill and inspiration , possibly spoil the educational experience of an entire class for the rest of their life . 
point : measuring teachers' performance will create a transparent market for teach talent . underperforming teacher will be select out because they be less in demand , unless they adapt and learn from what their competitor apparently do good . so , the overall quality of the teacher pool will rise and this will increase the quality of education for all student . 
counterpoint : competition will diminish the quality of education across the board . teamwork be essential for the effectiveness of school . making difference in performance more visible will hamper teamwork because it will create perverse incentive . for instance , teacher who have devise a successful method for teach a particular subject area will be less likely to share this because share it mean erode their 'strategic advantage' in the 'marketplace for teachers' .
