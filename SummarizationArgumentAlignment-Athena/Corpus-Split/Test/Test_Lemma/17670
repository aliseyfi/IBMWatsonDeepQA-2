point : the effect of a general ban on the public display of the confederate flag would reach beyond those whom it be so plainly meant to intimidate . it would remove what amount to a constant visual reinforcement of old southern racial doctrine and would consequently help to cultivate a more tolerant society . empirical study indicate that exposure to the confederate ? ag lead white participant to rate a hypothetical black male character more negatively than those in the control condition . participants' racial attitude fail to predict the degree to which ? ag exposure produce more negative evaluation . these ? ndings support the argument that exposure to the confederate ? ag activate racially bias responding , by virtue of the ? ag's cultural association with prejudice , and result in negatively biased judgment of black people 1 . 
counterpoint : censoring an ideology merely heighten the resentment felt by it adherent . banning the confederate flag would do nothing to eradicate the root cause of racial prejudice , and would in fact be far more likely to exacerbate feeling of intolerance . censorship of even the most vile rhetoric , however appeal a prospect , do not work because the repressed subject inevitably return with more force just to spite the censor : it be hard to imagine a big boon to racism in america than an effort to ban private display of the confederate battle flag . 1 indeed , such proscription often serve only to reinforce paternalistic stereotype about member of minority group , suggest that they need special protection from offensive speech . 2 
point : because the confederate flag be almost invariably fly in community affect by some degree of racial discord , it potency a a symbol of nostalgia for the racial hierarchy of the old south be heighten . were it to be fly in community which enjoy a pronounced racial harmony , the flag would be less likely to incite act of hatred . however , when adjudicate the question of whether to allow such a display , the value of such expression should be balance against the likelihood that it will cause harm . the risk be great when hate propaganda incorporate symbolism that demagogue have historically display to rally supporter to action state must use historical record to identify symbolism that be likely to terrorize the populace and , therefore , detract from the common good 1 . 
counterpoint : such scenario lend a connotation of bigotry to almost any act . in community affect by racial disharmony , almost any symbol have the potential to take on a cultural significance effectively identical to that of the confederate flag . it be not a though the flag be conceive a a mean of demonstrate intolerance , or be primarily use a such today . those who fly the confederate color do so merely a a mean of express pride in their heritage . if that be an act of bigotry , then practically any tradition or icon which relate to the old south must be treat likewise . indeed , just a one can show an association between a symbol and racism , one could show a dissociation have occur . . . a racist symbol could conceivably be 'cleansed' of it racist quality by become commonplace , in much the same way prayer before legislative session have become ceremonial 1 . 
point : insofar a the confederate flag be representative of a social order in which people of color be of comparable status to property , it display create an untenable atmosphere of racial intolerance . though the first amendment be explicit in guarantee the right to free expression , hate speech which serve to promote violence towards a particular group or individual be acknowledge to fall outside the boundary of constitutional protection . any interpretation which would seek to narrow the definition of hate speech to only encompass direct exhortation to violence fails to acknowledge that white supremacists' racist ideology blame racial and ethnic minority for all of society's ill . when demagogue and leader of hate group use racist and hateful propaganda , they be seek follower whose attachment to the organization be premise on see member of outgroups a less than human . once minority be assume to be subhuman , there be no longer any reason not to eliminate them by attack them physically 1 . 
counterpoint : bigoted rhetoric should only be limit when it constitute an immediate incitement to violence . displaying the confederate flag be an expressive act which contain numerous and varied meaning . though it be plainly true that many associate the flag with notion of white supremacy , it could only be take a an exhortation to violence in the most indirect sense . as note in the 1969 supreme court case brandenburg v . ohio , the constitutional guarantee of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy . . . except where such advocacy be direct to incite or produce imminent lawless action and be likely to incite or produce such action . if such an inconsequential gesture a this be to be consider an act of incitement , then any number of seemingly innocuous speech act must also lose their first amendment protection , so long a they hold the bare potential to inspire violent sentiment in their audience . indeed , a decide in the 1961 case noto v . united states , even the teaching of the moral propriety or . . . moral necessity for a resort to force and violence , be not the same a prepare a group for violent action and steel it to such action . 
point : the right to free speech be an instrumental , rather than an intrinsic good . it do not derive it value from some abstract notion of expression for expression's own sake , but from the manner in which our first amendment right enable u to communicate our idea to others in both private and public discourse . the confederate flag possess little , if any purpose save for the inflammation of linger racial tension . furthermore , any sentiment which one could conceivably seek to express use the confederate flag could be articulate in a much more constructive fashion through other mean . there exist , a argue in the 1942 supreme court decision chaplinsky v . new hampshire , certain well define and narrowly limited class of speech , the prevention and punishment of which have never be think to raise any constitutional problem . . . it have be well observe that such utterance be no essential part of any exposition of idea , and be of such slight social value a a step to truth that any benefit that may be derive from them be clearly outweigh by the social interest in order and morality . to display the confederate flag be no invitation to dialogue , but rather an act of intimidation this be not something the government should be endorse by allow the flag to be fly on public property . 
counterpoint : communicative value be an incredibly subjective criterion by which to determine the legal status of a speech act . regardless of whether one perceive the confederate flag to be a slap in the face to all those who remember the darker aspect of the old south or a legitimate and innocuous mean of express pride in one's heritage , it sanctity a a form of speech must be respect . like any symbol , it communicative value be impossible to objectively judge , and be largely dependent on the viewer's own attitude . hence , to strip the flag of it constitutional protection with the rationale that it be not a valid form of expression invite the closing of any number of other avenue of communication , particularly those which appeal to sentiment rather than rationality . indeed , a explain in the 1971 supreme court decision cohen v . california , much linguistic expression serve a dual communicative function : it convey not only ideas capable of relatively precise , detached explication , but otherwise inexpressible emotion a well . . . which , practically speak , may often be the more important element of the overall message seek to be communicate .
