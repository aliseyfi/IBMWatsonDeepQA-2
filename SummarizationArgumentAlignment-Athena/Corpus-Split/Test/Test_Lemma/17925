point : a recent study conduct among prisoner in florida find that from 1997 to 2010 the proportion of new inmate who have commit violent crime collate both state and federal prison statistic fell by 28 i . meanwhile , the number of first time prisoner who have commit non violent offence rise by 189 ii . 
counterpoint : the victim of non violent offence may suffer as much a the victim of violent offence . a large scale financial fraud , such a that perpetrate by robert maxwell or bernard madhoff , may deprive thousand of individual of their saving and pension , condemn them to a life of poverty . a petty drug dealer may be supply a habit that drive an addict to steal and attack others in order to find money . 
point : the prison environment be harmful to many offender . consider the risk of develop a drug or alcohol addiction while incarcerate in the uk 15 of the inmate of one of the uk s large jail test positive for drug in 2006 i ; the risk of be subject to sexual violence in an us prison 217 , 000 prisoner be subject to sexual violence in american prison in 2008 ii ; the rise in gang motivate violence and killing within prison on both side of the atlantic . 
counterpoint : although prisoner may associate closely with other criminal within jail , many more offender be introduce to crime outside prison . a deprive social background , a family life disrupt by domestic violence and family member with history of criminal behaviour can all lead an individual to become involved with crime . 
point : many of the rehabilitation and intervention scheme make available in prison be replicate in community setting by social service and charity . the cost of deliver these programme in prison originates from the concept of prison itself . the expense of building , equip , staff and monitor a prison vastly outweigh the cost of rehabilitative activity . research conduct by steve aos have show that rehabilitative program design to reduce crime can be cost effective i . 
counterpoint : as note above , the consequence of non violent crime can be just as damaging a those of violent crime . more over , non violent criminal can also present an immediate danger to society . 
point : the deterrent effect of prison be uniformly overstate . it be popularly think that the indignity and strictness of the prison environment will discourage criminal behaviour . further , exposure to the harsh reality of prison be think to discourage former inmate from re offending . these assumption do not reflect most offender reason , nor do they reflect the context in which most criminal behaviour occurs . punishment of the type offer by prison doesn t meet the criterion for reinforcement of behaviour that one would associate with behaviour change ; the punishment happen long after the behaviour , and be therefore futile i . 
counterpoint : it be unrealistic to expect the police to act a the sole deterrent to criminal behaviour . the majority of police work concern the detection rather than the prevention of crime . only a massive and unfeasible expansion of police number and power could provide a real deterrent to criminality .
