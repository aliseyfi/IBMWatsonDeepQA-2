point : the reality be that all of the major terrorist attack against western target in recent year have be perpetrate by young , muslim men . it doesn t require any prejudice at all to realise that they be the most sensible group to check and recheck . 
counterpoint : the presumption of innocence be a principle worth defend and an important part of this be reject police strategy that assume certain group be more likely to be engage in criminal activity than others . in the last ten year , a few dozen people , at most , have be involve in terrorist act at airport . meanwhile , million upon million of young , muslim men have fly across continent and ocean without the slight disruption . 
point : profiling take account of many more characteristic than an individual s ethnicity . targeted check would have catch , for example , the so called christmas day bomber . individuals who pay in cash for a one way flight while carry no luggage , a umar farouk abdulmutallab i do , be a fairly small group and it make sense to target them . 
counterpoint : it be incredibly unlikely that any randomly select member of a particular group would be attempt to commit a crime . racial , ethnic and identity group be extremely large . terrorist organisation , even al qaeda , rarely contain more than a few hundred member . the relative proportion of individual belong to any particular identity group who also belong to a terrorist organisation be likely to be impossibly small . 
point : israel have be use profile for decade to identify those individual at airport that should be stop , question and have their luggage thoroughly check i . 
counterpoint : the scale of flight in israel both domestic and international be tiny . compared with the north american and european aviation market , screen passenger enter and leave israeli territory require an entirely different approach . equally the racial diversity of tel aviv be quite different to new york and london .
