point : the threat of a direct military attack on the european member state be very remote . as nato s new strategic concept acknowledges : today , the euro atlantic area be at peace and the threat of a conventional attack against nato territory be low . 1 
counterpoint : even though the threat of direct military attack be low , there be no guarantee that it will remain so . armed force act a an insurance policy against the emergence of a future threat . once they have be reduce , they cannot be rapidly reconstitute a recruiting and training personnel , and purchasing or manufacturing arm be long term process . effective arm force cannot simply be conjure into existence . further , the threat of military attack be low because , in part , europe s arm force deter such a threat . nato s new strategic concept acknowledge this : peace in europe be an historic success for the policy of robust defence , euro atlantic integration and active partnership that have guide nato for more than half a century . 1 reducing europe s arm force would weaken this deterrent . 
point : the commitment to collective defense remain a core purpose of the alliance . article 5 of the nato treaty specifically state : the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be consider an attack against them all . 1 the treaty go on to state that nato state will use the full force necessary to defend against such an attack . this commitment be recently reaffirm in nato s new strategic concept : nato member will always assist each other against attack , in accordance with article 5 of the washington treaty . that commitment remain firm and bind . 2 furthermore , nato have already back up it word with action : when article 5 be invoke on september 12 , 2001 , follow the attack on new york and washington , nato agree on , and deliver , a package of measure to support the united states . 
counterpoint : european member state cannot assume that nato will come to their defense if attack . article 5 of the nato treaty state that the member state will assist the party or parties so attack by take forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action a it deem necessary , include the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 1 it be not an automatic commitment to military defense . according to michael a . goldberg , editor in chief of the boston college international comparative law review , after nato invokes article five , each ally must then consider what assistance it should and will provide ; and , allies can provide any form of assistance they deem necessary to respond to the situation 2 . relying on nato be unwise . this be especially true because of nato s decision making structure require full consensus , which jay bergman , professor of russian history at central connecticut state university , describe thus : if just one member object , a course of action the remain 27 member favor cannot be carry out . 3 therefore nato s european member must still be able to defend themselves , because one dissent country could unravel their full protection . 
point : if nato need to step in to defend europe , it would be able to call on substantial armed force . according to gareth evans , chancellor of the australian national university , nato have a formidable war fighting and peace enforcement capacity , in term not only of the raw number of both personnel some 2 . 5 million in uniform and equipment over 5 , 000 helicopter for a start but also their interoperability , highly professional and integrated military command structure . 1 indeed , nato have show itself to be effective in the past . evans again argues , nato have demonstrate in more recent year considerable competence in the actual conduct of military operation , 2 cite the operation in kosovo in 1999 , bosnia from 1995 to 2004 , and afghanistan since 2001 . 
counterpoint : many of the force available to nato be structure and equip to deal with cold war threat . they have limit deployability and cannot operate for extend period away from home . the figure on paper do not give a full picture of nato s real capability or provide a justification for european allies to reduce their force level or spending . tomas valasek , an analyst at the centre for european reform have note that too much heavy cold war weaponry remain in place in europe ; it be expensive to maintain and , unless modernise to include up to date electronics , nearly useless . eu country also spend one third of what the americans spend per soldier : this mean that few eu serviceman and woman get the expensive equipment and training necessary for overseas operation . 1 
point : given that nato member will defend one another , and that three nato member the united states , britain and france between them deploy more than 10 , 000 nuclear weapon , 1 conventional war be extremely unlikely . as professor kenneth waltz argue , wars can be fight in the face of deter rent threat , but the high the stake and the close a country move toward win them , the more surely that country invite retaliation and risk it own destruction . states be not likely to run major risk for minor gain . 2 no likely aggressor be likely to be able to make such gain against europe a to make the risk of nuclear war worth the risk . 
counterpoint : the problem with nuclear deterrence be that nuclear weapon cause many small war , a phenomenon know a the stability instability paradox . peter lavoy explain : mutual fear of big weapon may produce , instead of peace , a spate of small war state arm with nuclear weapon might bully or attack their non nuclear neighbor and then use their nuclear arsenal to intimidate foreign power from intervene . 1 indeed this have play out in the history of the nuclear age . nuclear weapon and mutually assured destruction provide the backdrop for cold war confrontation between the superpower that occur through their proxy in theatre like vietnam and afghanistan . 2 so even when they have nuclear weapon nation need to keep their troop for conventional war . 
point : given that most nato member have be in a deep recession , and direct military threat to their territory be unlikely , it only make sense to cut defense expenditure . in the uk , for example , gaby hinsliff note , as a result of the cost of borrow through a recession , in five years' time the national debt be forecast to reach 1 . 3 trillion 1 clearly , nato member have more pressing concern than keep up superfluous army . currently , britain spend over 2 of it gdp on defense , and secretary of state for defence liam fox recently admit that the mission in libya may cost the uk up to 260 million 2 . with a grow military cost for ammunition , wage and supply such a food nato member can afford no course of action other than cut their armed force cost . 
counterpoint : spending just 2 of gdp on defense nato s target , which , in fact , very few allies meet be historically a very small sum . the european allies collectively spend only about a third of what the us and canada spends . 1 this be not enough . politicians demand more and more of their armed force commitment to international operation , support to the civil authority at home , preparedness to conduct territorial defense operation and most european armed force be already suffer from overstretch , i . e . they have insufficient capacity to carry out the task place upon them .
