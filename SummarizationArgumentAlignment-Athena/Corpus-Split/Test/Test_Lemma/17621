point : drm have a 'chilling effect' on genuine technological research , prevent legitimate reverse engineering of technology for research purpose , particularly in university department which don't get funding for this because of the potential legal issue . in the usa the dmca have also be cite a chilling to legitimate user , such a student of cryptanalysis include , in a well know instance , professor felten and student at princeton , and security consultant such a niels ferguson , who have decline to publish information about vulnerability he discover in an intel secure compute scheme because of his concern about be arrest under the dmca when he travel to the us . 1 
counterpoint : those not commit illegal act have nothing to fear from the medium industry . those who be not commit illegal act have nothing to fear from the medium industry . however , if phd student who engage in some casual software piracy on the side be deter from their research by the threat of potential legal action , then that be a good consequence of drm . the oxford internet institute have show that the interest of budding and experienced cryptographer can be put to far good use reverse engineering the software behind the great firewall of china , aid the spread of freedom of information and democracy rather than focus on drm software . 1 
point : it be generally accept in most legal jurisdiction that copy medium for the use of others be a form of steal and should remain illegal . however , this should be enforce by target pirate who produce large quantity of copied medium in bulk , rather than target innocent or low impact home user share song with a friend or transfer a song from a cd to an mp3 player for listen on the move . such home user make little difference to the viability of the medium or software industry , but the action of pirate impact upon their ability to make profit from the intellectual property they own . a good example of this be the drm on the blu ray edition of the film avatar which render the disc unplayable on many blu ray player . 1 drm isn't effective against piracy and so we should see it a an anti competitive practice and trade barrier which make life bad for consumer and doesn't bring benefit to artist or the music industry in the long run . 
counterpoint : it should not be more important to target pirate . treating commercial pirate and home user differently , despite the fact that they be both commit act of piracy run against the principle of the uniformity of the rule of law . companies be within their right to protect medium just a if it be any other product . if anything , the prevalent view that low level home piracy be a socially acceptable crime which hurt no one , be a clear reason why home user should be treat a pirate . drm software do not prevent legitimate use of a product , but it do aim to reduce the incidence of casual piracy which have be make easier by software such a bittorrent and have result in over 60 of the software in most eastern european country be pirate rather than legitimate . 1 such casual piracy significantly harm the revenue of software and medium firm , small and large . 
point : drm technology should be consider an infringement on type of legitimate fair use consumer use , 1 harming right for consumer which be protect under the world intellectual property organisation copyright treaty , 1996 . drm aim to make it impossible to create compilation of song videos that you already own . microsoft zune's limit share technology prevents unlimited stream between two device own by the same individual . activation scheme frequently incorrectly tell user that they be use pirate product when reinstallation be attempt after a crash for instance the windows 'genuine advantage' scheme . further , drm make it very difficult for firm who operate thousand of computer to install multiple copy volume license often do away with drm , result in a huge economic cost to them in term of have to install on every system separately . evidence of an acknowledgement of this counter productivity come when emi stop release audio cds with drm in january 2007 because of the sheer number of cd player they be incompatible with . they themselves admit that the cost of drm do not measure up to the result . 
counterpoint : there be no fair use right that allow copy a product . there exist no right to copy a product for personal use . 1 opponents of drm just think that the medium industry be retail a different product . if medium firm choose to sell single use or single license medium then that be their right and they should be able to use technology to prevent the breach of this contract by user , be they home user or large corporation . the act of copy medium involve no interpretation a in the case of a play which be perform ; it be the simple duplication of the original . if you want to listen to a cd in two different location , you need to take that cd between them or pay for another copy if you prefer . further , even for interpretive reproduction specifically the theatre , author be still allow to enforce restrictive set of right during their lifetime , prevent certain interpretation such a cross casting . all digital medium firm be do be put in place a technology to protect those right . 
point : continued reliance on drm inhibit the industry shift towards new model of content management for the future . the medium industry need to preserve it revenue by move in at least some way in the direction of the creative commons agreement . drm go in exactly the opposite direction . it hurt the firm because it give consumer a negative experience and place the burden on them to prove that they aren't pirate , but doesn't even stop those who actually pirate . viacom's 1bn lawsuit against google for their youtube subsidiary could have act to inhibit the growth of the web video industry , prevent transition to a sustainable per view ? model of revenue sharing . youtube win the lawsuit , but a pay per view be not yet be use . 1 
counterpoint : shifts towards new model be not prevent by drm . drm and a shift towards creative commons license be not mutually exclusive , they can just apply to different form of medium or different content . further , here again , government should not act a agent to tip industry into follow the perceived right path for their future . surely this be just a intuitively wrong a the thought of the government step into the vhs v . betamax debate . 1 in order to prevent the production of incompatible video both would be a waste of resource . this argument be bizarre and be worryingly similar to those make in command economy during the 1980s .
