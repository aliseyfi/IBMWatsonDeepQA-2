point : people should be allow to spend their money a they wish . if parent choose to spend money on their child s advancement over something else they could buy then it be there decision to make . the core of this be the idea of ownership over our income , and that the state should not be able to restrict our spending this income by ban product such a private education . education in germany can be use a an example of allow parent the free will to decide where their child go to school , article 7 paragraph 4 of the grundgesetz enshrine the right to create private school . the grundgesetz . 
counterpoint : the state already do restrict our spending by criminalize the purchase of certain good . for example we cannot choose to spend our money buying slave even if we desire to . just a we shouldn t be able to buy another human life , we also should not be able to buy an advantage in life . it seem clear throughout this debate that private education do give an advantage over state school in many area . this argument of an unfair advantage have also be identify by ontario s canada provincial ministry of education where they be go to identify where a credit be earn if outside the student s high school tamsyn 2010 . it far seem unfair to say that people should have a right to choose private education , while this choice be not available to everyone . those who cannot afford the huge expense of private education be often not choose to put their child into state school , they just have no other option . the average annual cost of send a child to private school in the uk be 9 , 627 , which work out at 36 of the average earning ; in the usa the cost of a year s secondary education be 10 , 549 , out of reach of most family . the guardian , 2007 ; capenet . org . therefore in defend the freedom to choose to send a child to private school , we be merely defend the right of the wealthy to have this choice and restrict the choice of everyone else . 
point : the state fund the education system through taxation . parents who do not send their child to state school still pay those same tax . therefore , these tax be spend on a small number of school and there be more money per child in the state sector than there would be if we ban private education . in 2008 there be 569 , 080 student in independent school in england , bbc 2009 this would be a very large extra burden for state school to bear . these student parent be therefore not only pay for their own child but also for student to study at state school as well . 
counterpoint : while it be true that parent who be have their child educate privately still pay their tax that get spend on state education , it be also worth note that private school currently hold charitable status in the uk , and a such benefit from tax subsidy that some people estimate a 88 million annually bbc , 2011 . this money be able to fund facility that state school could not afford . therefore while private school financially benefit state school in some way , they also be financially damage to state school in many other way . 
point : in 2007 , time the us magazine discover that private school in the us receive much high sat score that the state counterpart . research suggest that private education put a great emphasis on critical thinking , while state school emphasise memory and learning by rote time . com . these type of critical skill mean that student from private school have a good start at university education a they be more used to what will be require of them . furthermore , student from private school be more likely to get into a university in the first place time , 2007 bbc , 2010 . in the us student be twice as likely to get the grade allow them to go to university if they have have a private education , and for minority group in america it be more than double capenet . org , 2001 . this be likely to be replicate across the world . private school in brazil also provide good education , a there be one teacher per 10 student in comparison to the 45 50 student per class in a government funded school . cabra ; and throssell 2010 . therefore by deny private education the effect may be disastrous for these minority group . 
counterpoint : the us magazine time find research in 2007 that suggest that private school do not provide a good education than state school , they do however have a high percentage of student who would do well in any situation . this mean that these child would not lose out by go to state school . the study say that it be the kind of economic and resource advantage their parent can give student as well a the level of parental involvement in their kids' education that determine success or failure in high school . the problem isn't in the school ; it's with social inequality time . com .
