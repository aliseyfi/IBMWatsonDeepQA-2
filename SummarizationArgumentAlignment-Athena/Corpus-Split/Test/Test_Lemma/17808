point : changing the way money be give will reduce corruption , embezzlement and manipulation . centralised government structure control aid distribution in many recipient country . as a consequence , embezzlement by government official have become more frequent and easy to conceal . linking aid to specific project be ineffective at solve this problem due to difficulty in track individual project account within the recipient nation . the need to monitor which individual and institution receive donate fund , and to confirm that fund have be apply accord to agree plan and schedule still present a difficult and intractable auditing problem . 
counterpoint : advocates of government to government aid do not have to defend such out dated portrayal of oda . since at least 2000 , many dac member nation have tie their aid entirely or in part to political , economic and environmental reform . the burden be now on recipient nation to prove that aid payment be not be squander . an onus be place on recipient to invest in the creation of a political culture that tackle corruption , a have be see with the founding of an anti graft task force in kenya in 2006 . linked aid promote political stability , development policy conscious of the limitation of national resource and a consistent economic framework . 
point : direct aid create dependence and a dangerous client culture among recipient state . oda be entwine with foreign policy to the degree where aid be no longer allocate on the basis of need , but accord to the political and policy objective of donor state . the usa can muster the political will to provide military aid to israel total nearly 3bn a year i , but even in the wake of live8 , real aid payment of fresh fund to recipient , a oppose to fund acquire by reschedule exist aid obligation to the poor nation in africa be not a large proportionately . 
counterpoint : cutting aid payment to the government of state that be aid dependent would severely restrict the provision of public service and undermine public and international confidence in fragile political settlement . this dependence therefore prevent the aid be cut off . 
point : direct aid undermines local market within develop state . many economist believe that economic growth need to occur at a local or micro level , with private industry spur growth and provide employment opportunity i that act to elevate consumer demand . chile be often give a an example of a country which have grow in this way . 
counterpoint : using central government spending to encourage growth be still a viable development strategy .
