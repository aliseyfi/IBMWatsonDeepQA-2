point : in a free market , good be voluntarily exchange at a price arrange solely by the mutual consent of seller and buyer . the aggregate market price be the result of all individual transaction and contain important information for both buyer and seller . when there be more demand than supply , price rise because buyer have to outbid each other , make it attractive for new producer to enter the market and thus add supply . when there be more supply than demand , price fall , cause some seller to leave the market since their production cost be high than the price at which they can sell . thus , in the long run , market settle on an equilibrium price where demand and supply be exactly equal . 
counterpoint : it might be that under theoretical condition , free market match up supply and demand in the long run , but a the famous economist john maynard keynes say : in the long run we be all dead . even if a stable equilibrium be theoretically possible , in practice , it almost never happen , with high fluctuation in price , shortage and excess a a consequence a tract on monetary reform , 2000 . 
point : companies in the free market not only compete on price , the also compete on innovation . this be because innovation allow company to leapfrog the competition by either drive their competitor out of the market by suddenly be able to provide a similar good for a fraction of the cost , or by create a completely new market for a good or service . in the latter case , the company can expect to reap monopoly profit for a while until the competition catch up . the corollary of this be that this innovation literally destroy old , more inefficient business in a process call creative destruction capitalism , socialism and democracy , 2008 . 
counterpoint : the free market doesn t invest in fundamental research this be research to understand fundamental principle a it do not have a commercial purpose and may never result in a commercial product , ultimately , fundamental research be the key enabler of innovation . private company don t invest in fundamental research , because by it nature it be open end and very expensive and a a result may never pay back the investment . 
point : liberty be one of the high value human being strive for . liberty mean that individual own themselves : individual only decide for themselves what to do with their mind and body during their lifetime . private property be an extension of this , because private property come about by undertake an activity with one s own body or mind : when i pluck apple from a wild apple tree , they become my property through me use my own body to do the plucking . similarly , free exchange be an extension of this , because it only come about if both party perceive the exchange to be beneficial to them : i will only sell the apple i pluck if i get more value in exchange than the value that continue possession of the apple give me . 
counterpoint : the procedural justice of free exchange be important , but be presumes that human be bear with equal talent and in equally enable environment . this be obviously not true : people can be bear to parent with high or low socio economic status and the talent they be bear with , like iq , be normally distribute .
