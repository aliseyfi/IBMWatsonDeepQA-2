point : the international energy agency iea 2011 forecast that global energy demand will increase by one third from 2010 to 2035 , and 90 of the increase demand will come from non oecd country like china and india world energy outlook 2011 factsheet , 2011 . with the state of technology a it be , alternative technology like solar power be insufficient to meet this demand . this mean we will continue to use fossil fuel and will continue to increase carbon dioxide emissions the iea predict a 20 increase of carbon dioxide emission , cause a long term increase in global average temperature , with catastrophic effect . if we can t escape use fossil fuel , we should at least limit their emission as much a possible , and ccs be a very effective mean to that end . 
counterpoint : we shouldn t be invest in the continue use of fossil fuel 
point : the intergovernmental panel for climate change ipcc find that with current capture technology , carbon dioxide emission reach the atmosphere from fossil fuel can be reduce by about 80 90 carbon dioxide capture and storage , 2005 . this lead the international energy agency to conclude that ccs be a key technology to stem carbon dioxide emission that can be responsible for up to 18 of emission saving in a safe scenario for climate change world energy outlook 2011 factsheet , 2011 . this be because ccs can be fit to exist power plant rather than require completely new plant to be build . 
counterpoint : ccs be too expensive to be cost efficient 
point : currently , there be many project around the world demonstrate the feasibility of ccs . one well know example be the sleipner project in norway . this site have be in operation since 1996 . another example be the weyburn midale project in canada , which have store over 20 million tonne of carbon dioxide since october 2000 . interactive map , global ccs institute , 2011 
counterpoint : ccs can t scale up in time to be effective
