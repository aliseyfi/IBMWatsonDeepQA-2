point : government employee be , ultimately , duty bound to uphold the policy and principle implement by the executive branch . the executive be limit in it range of action it be necessary to delegate certain of it duty to body such a the police , the military and the education service . 
counterpoint : working for a state be no different to any other job . indeed , social service that may be provide by the state in one western liberal democracy will be provide by private or third sector business in another . a significant proportion of the american healthcare industry be either privatised or partially subsidise . 
point : allowing teacher and youth leader to be member of extremist political group present a significant risk to child and young adult . there be , of course , an unsubtle point to be make about the possibility that teacher with extremist view may attempt to indoctrinate their charge . 
counterpoint : under the status quo , teacher in most western liberal democracy be already oblige to conceal their political belief from their student . this convention also frequently apply to high education institution in many state . thus , it be already possible to discipline or dismiss teacher who engage in overtly political activity within the classroom . 
point : it be often unclear whether extremist political organisation be likely to become violent or to engage in provocative act of hate speech . although the state do not have a right to obstruct or prevent such organisation from meeting or protesting , it do have a right to control the manner and circumstance in which such meeting take place . doing so ensure that citizen who do not want to be involve in , or whose activity and freedom might be materially affect by the articulation of extremist view can go about their business without hindrance . part of the state s role be to balance these set of incommensurate right . all western liberal democracy use their police force to enforce this balance . 
counterpoint : state employee include member of the security and police service encounter conflict of interest throughout their working life . a police officer may become involve in a case in which a member of his or her family be suspect . a civil servant or local council worker may be require to determine whether friend , family or a partner should receive a state fund subsidy .
