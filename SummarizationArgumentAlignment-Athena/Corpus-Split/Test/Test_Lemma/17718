point : all the rule and law that protect the accuse at the first trial will be in place at a second it's not a if the rule of law suddenly disappear . the presumption of innocence , proof beyond reasonable doubt , the right to a fair hearing and competent counsel , the judge's duty to appropriately direct the jury , etc . will all continue to apply and prevent miscarriage of justice from occur . nor be the system likely to be overwhelm with retrial . much of the current push for the end of the double jeopardy rule come from the widespread use of dna testing , which have allow many old case to be revisit with compel new evidence of guilt or innocence . mark weston , for example , be convict at a re trial after speck of the victim's blood be find on weston's shoe , justify the re opening of the case1 . after a few year , the impact of dna test on solve similar cold case will be expend and there will be very few retrial . 1 bate , s . 2010 , december 13 .

counterpoint : juries will know this be a retrial because evidence will have to be read from the first trial where witness have die , because note from last time will be available to advocate and the accuse , because the legal procedure of the last trial will be subject to discussion in this one . if a jury know a case have be bring again , there will be a presumption that the accuse be guilty because a high court have already decide that the new evidence make the acquitted defendant now look guilty after all , and so grant a retrial . the presumption of innocence will no longer exist . and unless the system be go to be overwhelm with retrial like this , in which case it would be unworkable , then second trial capacity can only and rightly be direct towards exceptional case . such case be well know like that of the murder of stephen lawrence 1 . how could individual face trial again on the same charge , when in the glare of medium attention it have be declare they should have be convict at the first trial ? how could they possibly expect a fair trial ? 
point : the problem with the 'double jeopardy' rule be that people who be clearly guilty because new evidence have emerge , because they've confess be not be punish for crime they have commit . we believe that guilty people should be punish for their crime , and our justice system should be tailor to allow that . in 2009 , a footballer in london confess to murder his ex girlfriend at a re trial after fresh evidence be find to overturn the original verdict1 ; under previous double jeopardy law in britain , the murderer would have remain free . we have as great a duty to ensure miscarriage of justice be not perpetrate on victim a on accused . an offence commit ten year ago do not cease to be an offence because time have pass , or because the perpetrator have manage to evade justice in the past . the criterion by which the decision to charge an individual be take ought to be likelihood of guilt , not whether or not they have have a trial before . 1 bbc news a . 2009 , may 21 . cleared man admit kill woman . retrieved july 15 , 2011 , from bbc news : 4 
counterpoint : the override objective of the justice system be to ensure that the innocent go free , not that the guilty be punish , and the system should be orientate around that objective . 
point : the scrapping of the double jeopardy would be practicable if it be permit for serious crime , like murder and rape , and only when fresh , compelling evidence of guilt emerges that call into question the original acquittal . such restriction on any scrapping of the rule would not tie up court in re trial , for they could only be call for certain crime in certain , restricted condition . the british law commission in a 2011 review conclude that whilst the ancient rule of double jeopardy be of 'fundamental importance' , it should be possible to quash acquittal in murder trial where there be 'reliable and compel new evidence of guilt' . in practise , this would preserve the traditional advantage of the law , whilst ensure that those who be guilty , and can be prove so , do not remain free . 
counterpoint : such restriction on double jeopardy would not be effective in practice , for they attempt to put a value on the relative importance of crime without use either the prospect of re offending or the impact on victim . as qc geoffrey robertson note in response to the law commission's finding , it be irrational to confine the possibility of re trial to 'serious crimes' alone and exclude repetitive , professional crime like arm robbery . if the intention of the repeal be to bring both offender to justice and prevent far crime , it be exactly the 'repetitive , professional' criminal who should be target . 
point : when we see people still unpunished for offence in society they've clearly commit , it damage our faith in the justice system . our bargain with the state entail the state's right to judge the individual because the state protect the individual : if our attacker roam the street because an arbitrary legal rule exempts them from prosecution despite clear guilt , then that system have break down . when jennifer mcdermott witness her daughter's murderer get convict at a re trial , she describe it a a 'victory for everyone who feel let down by the justice system . '1 victims deserve such justice and it be an insult to them , and all of u , to see their persecutor go free . as a home office spokesman state when england overturn the double jeopardy ban , 'it be important the public should have full confidence in the ability of the criminal justice system to deliver justice . '1 justice be only applicable when the perpetrator remain within the arm of the law ; double jeopardy prevents this . 
counterpoint : faith in the justice system be derive from it be be to be fair and even hand . it be not merely faith on the part of victim that offender will be find guilty , but faith on the part of innocent defendant that they will be find innocent .
