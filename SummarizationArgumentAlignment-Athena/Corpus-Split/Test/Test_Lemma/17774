point : refusing to prescribe contraceptive for girl below the age of consent assumes that no under age girl can make an informed decision to choose a sexual relationship . medical advice and prescription should be give on an individual , rather than uniform , basis . as long a these girl meet the requirement for consent lay out by the relevant medical authority , there should be no reason for contraceptive should be deny to them . the decision of whether an individual be ready to engage in a sexual relationship be a purely personal one ; refuse contraceptive place them at unnecessarily medical risk , both physically and mentally , and do not adhere to the duty of care by doctor for their patient 1 . 
counterpoint : we have to place a limit somewhere . though some child might be emotionally mature enough for sex at the age of 12 or 13 , it be also destructive to imply that they all be . it can be very difficult to gauge whether a young girl have genuinely understand the true consequence of her contraception , and give routine prescription to under age girl could give fuel to peer pressure 1 a there be now no medical obstacle why the girl can refuse sex . informed consent be very difficult to gauge accurately , and the potential to misidentify a vulnerable girl who be be coerce a a girl who be fully inform could carry enormous consequence and fail to care for the best medical interest of the patient . 
point : although it be almost impossible to absolutely prevent underage sex , a already show by rise teen pregnancy rate in the us , the uk and across europe 1 2 , it be possible to encourage safe sex . sex education programme which teach abstinence rarely seem to deter sexual activity or prevent teen pregnancy and sexually transmit infection 3 . however , study research the effect of provide contraceptive in school have find that there be no increase in sexual activity 4 . if this principle be extend to include the many different type of contraception available by prescription , this could feasibly help to lower high teenage pregnancy rate ; for example , the prescribed pill have a high efficiency rate than condom , which be often available in school or clinic 5 but use inefficiently 6 . devices like the iud also remove any problem of girl forget to take their pill on time . 7 allowing under age girl to be able to talk to a doctor and receive the form of contraception which be best fit for them 8 would actively tackle rise teen pregnancy rate . 
counterpoint : it be very difficult to gather accurate information over whether increased availability of contraception do or do not lead to increase sexual activity . however , the gesture of allow underage girl to receive prescription from doctor be dangerous in principle . it represent the systematic removal of every restraint that use to act a a disincentive to under age sex 1 , and undermine the law currently in place . even if this do not have an immediate , visible , short term effect on teen sexual activity , it may well lead to a disregard towards the need for emotional maturity in sex over the long term . 
point : the decision to have sex be an incredibly subjective one . some girl might be ready at 13 , others may not be ready until they be in their twenty or old . in fact , the age where girl enter puberty have become progressively young ; so , whereas 11 might be consider an average age to begin puberty , some girl can begin puberty as young a 7 year old 1 . however , in either case or early or of late development , the subjective decision of sexual maturity should not be permit or outlaw by a system which take no personal account of the individual ; the only person who can judge if they be ready be the girl herself . 
counterpoint : society frequently limit independent choice when there be a risk of harm to that individual or others . this be particularly true of young people because society recognises that these choice be not fully inform , reason , or rational at such a young age . this be also why you must reach a certain age to make decision with substantial consequence such a get marry 1 2 or join the army 3 4 . in case such a these , where young girl body be still develop or they have just begin romantic relationship , they may not wholly understand their situation or the consequence and so cannot make a fully inform decision . this be even more evident if the girl would otherwise have unprotected sex rather than wait or use condom , at physical and psychological risk to herself . it show that they underestimate or misinterpret the long term consequence of their action . 
point : disallowing doctor to prescribe contraceptive to young girl impede their duty of medical ethic . the principle of beneficence instructs that doctor should do good for their patient 1 . if a young girl be in danger of an unplanned pregnancy and the potential medical complication which accompany it , a doctor should not deny her help if she ask for it and be medically suitable for the contraceptive . for example , she must be within the parameter for weight and blood pressure to take the combine pill , without undue likelihood of blood clot and other potential risk 2 . it be contradictory to give doctor the right to judge their patient s best interest , but simultaneously prevent them from act in their professional capacity . 
counterpoint : medical ethic and the law clash here . another important cornerstone of medical ethic be autonomy 1 , which require that the patient must be able to make a fully inform decision something which might be compromise by her potential lack of maturity at a young age . it be particularly important that medical autonomy exclude coercion or coax 2 this be place in jeopardy from the risk of teenage peer pressure 3 . however , there be nothing to prevent a young girl from simply speak to a doctor about her concern , which would also fulfil the doctor s ethical duty . doctors must also operate within the boundary of the law ; if this motion be pass , the principle of law would be violate instead . this motion can only replace one negative effect potential unprotected sex with another , break the law . it be not a satisfactory solution . 
point : by visit the doctor , young girl have more access to information which they might not get from their school sex education . given that , in the united states , there be no federal mandate to teach sex education in public school , and less than half of all public school . . . offer information on how to obtain birth control 1 , it be patently clear that the current educational system fail to address the need of young adolescent in this respect . a doctor s surgery or clinic be a more private environment for young girl to ask for clarification , without intimidation from male or female peer 2 , which encourage education and make sure that the girl be more fully inform before they have sex . 
counterpoint : this be an argument to improve sex education , rather than to rely on doctor to provide outside information . if the school system of sex education be not work , then it should be improve , rather than divert young girl elsewhere to try and find information . furthermore , other method of contraception be more easily available , such a condom at drop in clinic in the uk 1 . speaking directly to a doctor , and require them to professionally sanction this underage sexual behaviour , be not the only way to obtain contraception .
