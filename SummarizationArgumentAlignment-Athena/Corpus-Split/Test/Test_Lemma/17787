point : the european parliament s power need to be expand because there be a widespread perception that the eu suffers from a democratic deficit : national parliament have lose much of their power vi a vis national government through the committee base decision making in the council of ministers . this loss of national parliamentary influence have not be match by a proportional increase in the power and influence of the european parliament . to reduce this deficit the european parliament must be give parity with the council so that it can provide check and balance in the system . 
counterpoint : the democratic deficit be a myth . national government have a strong democratic mandate from national election . therefore , their decision be already imbue with considerable democratic legitimacy . national government also rely on national parliament to enact their legislation at home . as a result it would be extremely foolish of a government to pursue a course of action in the council which be oppose by national parliamentarian , or which would be unpopular enough to lead to a future electoral defeat at home . democracy be protect sufficiently by the council already ; there be thus no need to increase the power of the european parliament . 
point : the european parliament be the only pan european , directly elect institution in the eu . as such , only the european parliament can authentically speak for europe on any issue . it should consequently be a more privileged institution in the eu decision make process . as a step in this direction , the parliament should have equal power of co decision with the council on all legislative matter in the eu . 1 
counterpoint : the european parliament may speak for europe but the council speak for the eu s member state . privileging the european parliament at the expense of the council erode the intergovernmental nature of eu decision making . it be important to protect the sovereign power of the individual member state ; this be achieve in the council , which be comprise of representative of each national government . this have be particularly the case in the united kingdom where there have be row over sovereignty in relatively obscure area such a prisoner vote right . 1 
point : the level of turnout in election for the european parliament be worryingly low , in 2009 the average eu turnout be 43 and the low be in slovakia with a turnout of only 19 . 64 . 1 eu citizen clearly feel that the european parliament be not important enough , do not have enough power over their life , to justify them vote in european election . therefore , we must increase the power of the european parliament to increase it relevance to ordinary people . by make it more powerful we create an incentive for people to vote . 
counterpoint : the argument that we should increase the european parliament s power in order to increase people s interest in it be as flaw a it be well rehearse . this argument have be use to repeatedly expand the competency of the parliament . however , far from become more interested in the parliament , few and few people at each election have bother to vote , turnout be a much high 61 . 99 in 1979 although the average be partially reduce by new member on average have low turnout . 1 this argument merely signal the failure of the parliament a a democratic institution and unhappiness with the increasingly federal european project . rather than reward the eu parliament for failure , we should consider seriously it abolition .
