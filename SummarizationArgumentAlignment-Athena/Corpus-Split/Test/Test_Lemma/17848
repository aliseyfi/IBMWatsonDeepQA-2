point : the isolation of myanmar by some of the developed western power be arbitrary and mark by hypocrisy . the real reason for the stance take by these country be political . there be little consistency in the attitude take towards other government and dictatorship across the world that also have questionable human right record saudi arabia and egypt , to name a few , but either offer other strategic and economic benefit , or be much more influential in international affair than myanmar . myanmar be only part of a group of country also include cuba and north korea whose economic and political policy have remain relatively opaque to arm twisting by the us and the eu . it be unfair to impose sanction on and isolate myanmar on this basis , especially in an emerge multi polar international environment . 
counterpoint : this argument be not a defence of the government in myanmar . making it a question of who be point finger itself politicize a principled stance against an undoubtedly unjust system . the us and the eu have be consistent in their criticism of the military controlled government and in their principled support for pro democracy activist in myanmar . this be in line with their state position on human right and democracy across the world with political ally or enemy and in accordance with international treaty that they be signatory to . they have long voice concern over human right violation in china and india , for instance . only because their moral position may not have be a influential in relation to certain country , or that it have be diplomatically unfeasible to take strong position in certain circumstance due to global power relation , it do not mean they should not take such a position in the case of myanmar a well . 1 
point : myanmar have take significant step towards democratisation in the last three year . the new constitution and the election that result in the current civilian government be appoint represent a marked shift in it governance structure . though there may be scope for improvement in it democratic framework , institution for democratic functioning have be create and this be a huge step forward . aung san suu kyi have also be release from house arrest , and the tone of the statement make by the new government have be a reconciliatory one . a new human right commission have also be establish . while the pace of reform may not match the supposed expectation of the us and the eu , myanmar s choice to change gradually and engage with them on it own term must be respect . the fundamental circumstance under which a policy of limited engagement be adopt with myanmar have change , and this call for reassessment . 
counterpoint : despite the change in nominal governmental structure , the real holder of power have remain the same . the president thein sein be handpicked by the outgoing military leader than shwe . the top post in government and one fourth of parliament be reserve be the military . arbitrary law prevent leader of the nld , include aung san suu kyi , from participate in the election . elections do not equal democracy . other than the sugar coat word of the new government , there have be no real movement towards democratic reform . the international community have long call for an impartial investigation into the systematic human right violation to bring it perpetrator to justice . none of this have be promise , or be likely to be achieve under a military controlled government , the main aim of which be to hoodwink the international community and provide security to the guilty leader of the military junta . 1 
point : reengagement have potential for have a positive influence in various context . myanmar be rich in natural resource , include forest product , mineral and gem . removing trade restriction and offer developmental aid would benefit the local economy and population . 1 in the long term , economic activity can act a a stimulus for development of a strong legal and business framework to reduce corruption . if the us and the eu create confidence in the myanmar government that they be willing to offer something constructive rather than critical , it may be possible to ask for great transparency in government and reduce systematic violation of human right as well . 2 the newly elect civilian government have indicate it be willing to pursue democratic reform , and the us and the eu should not lose this opportunity for change . 
counterpoint : since the government be still control by the military and there be no evidence to that corruption level will go down in the new regime , engage in trade with myanmar will only strengthen the ruling elite . there be little accountability for developmental aid actually reach it desired goal . 1 trading with myanmar mean trading with organisation control by the state military in a nationalised economy . common people be exploit and keep in poverty while the profit be reap by a few . this have be the experience of international trade with myanmar involve country other than us and eu , and there be no reason that this will change . further , there be no necessary link between business activity and development of the rule of law , a the experience of many african country have show . opportunistic business entity be more likely to be involve in rent seek monopolistic practice that benefit them , instead of cause social change . 
point : the policy of disengagement have not result in any meaningful change in myanmar , politically or economically . since myanmar have not be dependent on the us or the eu , sanction and arm embargo have not have any effect on the government . the change in 2010 2011 have be due to the influence of the nld , and certain regional player like thailand and china which have seek to directly engage with myanmar . further , the section of the population that be most affected by the sanction be those not in the top tier of the political and economic class , but small manufacturer and the working class . restrictions on export and developmental aid from the us and the eu prevent local manufacturer and consumer from have access to them . on the other hand , restriction on import from myanmar weaken the market for it exporter . these factor only far impoverish and alienate the local population , increase economic disparity , and consequently the power of the rule elite in the national context as well . 
counterpoint : while the policy of disengagement may not have achieve all it goal , it have bring to the forefront a moral standard by which the government can be judge . this have help frame global opinion and influenced regional player attitude to myanmar as well to some extent . more harm be do by continue to engage with myanmar since that option offer no incentive or pressure for democratic reform . trading with myanmar will only add to the economic and political clout of the ruling elite , a the trickle down to the population a a whole be minimal . a policy of disengagement , at the very least , prevent the military which be sensitive to international opinion from become even strong . 
point : myanmar have continue economic and political relation with many other country , include member of the asean , and significantly , china which be also the source of a large proportion of foreign investment in myanmar . these country , some of which be major economic and political partner of the us and the eu , do not share the same attitude about the legitimacy of the myanmar government and the approach that should be take towards it . for the purpose of regional stability , it would be good for the us and the eu to align their position with the others . this reduce the risk of diplomatic rift which could destabilise the region . further , if the international community present a united viewpoint on what step myanmar should take to improve it democracy , such step be more likely to be take . 
counterpoint : though country in south asia have display ambivalence in their attitude towards myanmar , it be not a reason for the us and the eu to change their stance . regional player have sometimes tend to support the pro democracy movement in their rhetoric , but have not adopt policy that be align with it . therefore , they have not be able to cause any real democratic reform . if there be a united international community that do not actively seek to isolate myanmar , but to the contrary engages with it , the force that can drive such reform will become even weak . the risk of harm from long existent difference in attitude between regional player and those who seek to disengage be very low , and nothing have occur since 1990 to suggest otherwise .
