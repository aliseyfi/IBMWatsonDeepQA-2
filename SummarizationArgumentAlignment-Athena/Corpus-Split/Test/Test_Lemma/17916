point : offshore outsource lower the cost of good and service . there be no real need for all of the good and service that be consume within a highly developed economy to be produce in that economy . the sale price of a particular form of good or service be determine by a wide range of factor , include the pay demand make by the worker assemble the good or provide the service . seeking out a labour force willing to accept low wage and work longer hour enable a business to reduce the price and increase the overall supply of the product it offer i . 
counterpoint : failures and defect in outsourced labour and product take long to detect and be more expensive to remedy . whilst customer feedback or angry employee may indicate flaw in outsourced support or payroll service , a company may only realise that a component manufacture by an offshore partner be faulty when they take delivery of it . the process of return the component to it place of origin add further expense to the cost cause by the delayed completion of a client firm s product . 
point : offshore outsource incentivises wider engagement with education in develop state , for long period of time . while even more so than in the wealthy world education be see by citizen of develop nation a offer a path out of poverty or subsistence level economic activity , worry about property right , the breakdown of family and community and the acquisition of essential skill may lead to school become a low priority for old child and young adult . the connection between education , skills acquisition and improvement in income and living standard be not immediate . there be little impetus for worker and parent to pay for form of education that be not directly link to the sort of economic activity that be predominant in their community . in develop state that lack a grow service sector , the value of a qualification in science , accounting or compute cannot be immediately realise . this situation may prevent social mobility in one of two way . 
counterpoint : the educational policy of develop state should not be tailor to the need of business in the developing world . arguably , cross border trade in commodity and product be a important for nation in the developing world a partnership with wealthy company in europe and the usa . cross border trade of this type require skill distinct from those require by establish form of economic production farming , heavy industry , resource extraction and those require by the service industry . 
point : offshoring spur the development of poorer state . offshoring relies on the existence of a basic industrial base and certain essential form of state infrastructure , include an education system . these facility be likely to be partially or wholly absent in a develop economy . the readily available capital that be locate in the developed world , along with the example provide by other develop state that have successfully engage in offshoring project incentivises investment in service infrastructure and high quality education . 
counterpoint : side proposition s description of the economic process underlie off shore outsourcing be overly optimistic , and make claim about educational and industrial development in the first world that be highly contestable .
