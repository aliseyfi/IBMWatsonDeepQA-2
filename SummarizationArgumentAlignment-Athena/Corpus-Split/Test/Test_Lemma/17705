point : rainforests be responsible for 28 of the world's oxygen turnover1 , which be why they have be label the 'lungs of the earth' . their role in maintain breathable air be vital a the world population continue to increase exponentially . the rainforest be also a key carbon sink ; they be think to limit the greenhouse effect of global warming by absorb and store carbon , hence reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere2 . rainforests help to offset global carbon emission . to get an idea of the value of the sink , the removal of nearly five billion tonne of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forest , base on realistic price for a tonne of carbon , should be value at around 13 billion pound per year . this be a compelling argument for conserve tropical forest 3 . in addition , it have be calculate that 12 14 of global carbon emission come from the deforestation of rainforest in country such a brazil and indonesia4 . 1 'killer inhabitants of the rainforests' by gserrano , 4th january 2009 5 2 'amazon carbon sink effect slow ' , bbc 10th march 2004 6 3 'climate and energy : cop15 copenhagen 2009' 7 4 'seeing redd in cancun' by simon counsell , the guardian 8th december 2010 8 
counterpoint : to encourage country to invest in protect rainforest international body be offer country 'carbon credits' . the us be propose to spend 25bn on protect rainforest . however the proposal be base upon carbon credit , allow investor to earn carbon emission credit in return for save tree . this mean that for however much they invest into protect the rainforest , they will be allow to emit around one tonne of carbon dioxide . a ban on deforestation may in the end be counterproductive . awarding tradable credit to country that reduce deforestation will cause carbon price to plummet worldwide and may make global warm worse by pull investor away from renewable energy , an economic study find 1 . 
point : a ban on unsustainable logging be possible by create sustainable alternative . regulation can protect forest . in the u . s . , the state of california , the federal government and pacific lumber company reach agreement to protect the headwaters forest . the agreement ban log in certain area so a to protect headwaters' eco system . pacific lumber can log 425 , 000 cubic metre in specially protect buffer zones1 . 
counterpoint : while create a ban and provide alternative be useful and may reduce unsustainable log they will never manage to eliminate it entirely . while wood fetch a high price it will always be worthwhile engage in illegal logging . as there be no red tape and tree be readily available it be simple and cheap to engage in illegal logging which will almost always be do unsustainably . 
point : deforestation be often use a a tool for leverage in politics . frequently this involve collusion between the exploiter and government or the bribery of official responsible for enforcement of conservation regulation or for the protection of reserve . corruption often begin at high level and continue all the way down the government hierarchy . even if corruption be not outright in term of bribe , log company may seek concession , low fee and tax , or the waiving of international regulation in return for offer government a percentage of the revenue from the sale of the wood . governments then use the revenue gain from this deforestation for political gain , either through feed some of it back into society or by provide the newly create land to landless migrant . in a more sinister example , logging be use by the khmer rouge to fund it civil war in cambodia1 . governments in tropical country often feel that exploitation of natural resource be an opportunity for economic gain . for instance , in the 1980 ? s , malaysia , indonesia and the philippines export 85 million cubic meter of wood 4 of the global wood supply , worth about 3 billion2 , which have since grow to be one of their main industry . this give the government credibility a an economic force for good , though the sacrifice be sustainability and a condone even encourage of illegal logging . and an indefinable amount of the profit be siphon off into the private fund of some government official , unbeknownst to the population . 
counterpoint : deforestation should not be use for political purpose and prohibit log would be an unnecessarily extreme response a there be mechanism to encourage country to use more sustainable forestry method . if the financial incentive be great enough , and threat over trade embargo be sincere enough , log company and government will come to seek world bank loan to finance their forestry operation and a a result must comply with it rule regard sustainable harvesting . 
point : local indigenous people rely on area of the tropical rainforest for their home , provision for food , fuel and small scale subsistence farming . the amazon rainforest be the ancestral home of one million people and contain 400 human tribe , many of whom have never have contact with the outside world1 ; they eat many plant food such a orange , yam and banana , and bushmeats such a wild pig . their traditional small scale slash and burn farm technique and hunt cause about the same amount of damage to the rainforest a a tree fall and the plant be allow enough time that they can easily re colonise . similarly , there be 15 un contact tribe in the peruvian amazon , but their ancient way of life be under threat because more than 70 of the peruvian rainforest have be lease to oil company for exploration2 . in the past , oil exploration have lead to violent and disastrous contact with isolated indians . in the early 1980s , exploration by shell lead to contact with the isolated nahua tribe ; within a few year more than 50 of the nahua have died2 . in 1996 illegal logger force contact with the murunahua indians . in the following year over 50 of them die , mainly from cold , flu and other respiratory infections2 . these small tribe cannot adapt to life outside the rainforest and will die out , take with them ancient way of life . they could have valuable lesson to teach u about how to utilise ecosystem by work in harmony with them . 
counterpoint : indigenous people have no communal land ownership right . this mean that government have the right to offer land to those move in with proposal to use the land to it full potential1 ; these local tribe do not contribute to the economy of these disastrously poor country . tribes must learn to adapt to an expand and urbanising world . 
point : deforestation have long term environmental impact . there be a causal connection between deforestation , loss of biodiversity and climate change . rainforests be the most diverse habitat on earth ; they cover only 6 of the land surface of the world but scientist estimate they have over 50 of the earth's plant and animals1 . experts estimate that we be lose 137 plant , animal and insect specie every single day due to rainforest deforestation : that equate to 50 , 000 specie a year2 . moreover rainforest be not unproductive habitat . not only be they aesthetically please , they be also socially and economically important . they have many plant that be use in medicine . for example , the us national cancer institute have identify 3000 plant that be active against cancer cell ; 70 of these plant be find in the rainforest2 . indeed , 25 of the active ingredient in today's cancer fight drug come from organism find only in the rainforest2 . there be still many plant to be discover that could far aid medical research . if we lose this biodiversity , we will lose our ability to utilise these specie for our own benefit and the benefit of future generation on earth . 1 'tropical rainforest' by michael g , 2002 17 2 'deforestation in the amazon : facts' by ryan walters 1 
counterpoint : the environmental effect of deforestation be exaggerate satellite picture show that despite decade of exploitation , over 85 of brazil's amazon jungle region be still cover in trees1 and , in any event , be less important to develop country than economic growth . some scientist estimate that deforestation , if continue at it current pace , will only reduce specie in tropical forest by 5 10 in the next 30 years1 .
