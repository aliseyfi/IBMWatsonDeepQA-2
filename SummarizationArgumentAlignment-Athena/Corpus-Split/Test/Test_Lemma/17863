point : the status quo discourage interdependence : the absence of property right under the status quo encourages unmarried couple to act a individual , protect their own financial interest , rather than support each other . in uk law , their relationship with one another be not recognise a have any legal standing , and they have no special status in the eye of the english legal system 1 individuals be usually more able to pursue their own ambition when they have the support of another . for example , financial support and security make it easy to take risk which may be economically beneficial , such a set up a new business , or undergo further education to improve employment prospect . 
counterpoint : the absence of property right do not prevent interdependence : the law do not prevent individual support each other or take risk . however , it require that couple discuss such plan properly with each other and decide how they wish to structure their own relationship . expecting all couple , regardless of their circumstance , to support each other financially be unrealistic . furthermore , it be possible that at the margin some couple may not cohabit in order to avoid have to share their property . these couple will have even less support . 
point : fairness require that cohabit couple share their property on separation : when couple have live together for a long period such a five year or more they will have gain benefit at each other s expense but also suffer disadvantage for the other s benefit . if one partner give up a career to raise child or support the other in their career , they be seriously disadvantage upon separation . where the other partner have gain a a result of this sacrifice , they should compensate the former , so that the two party can move towards independence in equal position . parties may choose not to marry , but this should not have to cause such financial harm to one partner . 
counterpoint : property right be not fair : it be up to individual to protect themselves in the sphere of relationship . married couple have enter into a state endorse relationship which provide advantage both financially in term of tax and inheritance , and through recognition and validation . it be reasonable for the state to require something in return : namely , that the party be treat fairly , should that marriage end . moreover , marry couple be force to share their property because they have choose to commit themselves to each other . when people get marry they know what they be sign up to and can therefore be take to consent . 
point : property right for unmarried couple undermine marriage a an institution , harm society . the societal shift away from marriage be harmful . marriages tend to be more stable than cohabitation because of the great level of commitment involve : the mutual support of a marriage be beneficial for individual and can create a more secure environment for raise child . because of the high exit cost divorce be difficult and time consuming , marry couple be more likely to resolve their problem than cohabit couple who can walk away more easily . giving legal right to cohabit couple endorse more diverse relationship , suggest that marriage be less important . this be harmful a it be likely in the long term to far reduce the number of marriage , lead to fewer stable relationship . 
counterpoint : marriage be no longer the only type of serious long term relationship and the law should reflect this : the absence of property right on separation for cohabit couple send a message to society that cohabitation be a less meaningful relationship than marriage . marriage have strong religious connotation and be historically a vehicle for the oppression of woman . it be consequently unsurprising that some couple may not wish to enter into the institution of marriage . these couple can still have long term relationship which be just as stable a marriage . legal right would help to validate such relationship and recognise the reality of diverse family structure within society . furthermore , the status quo can be see to be coercive in that individual , who may not want to get marry , be force to do so if they wish to have legal right .
