point : by have both party in charge of different part of the government , there can be a great degree of scrutiny over policy a the opposition party will force the president to justify his policy . 
counterpoint : proposition make the assumption that single party government prevents checks and balances to be enact within the united states government . this be simply not true a there be still institutional break on the executive such a the supreme court . 
point : the constitution of the united states be design to prevent power from be concentrate in one place , with each of the three branch executive , legislative and judicial placing check and balance upon each other . as james madison write it be of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of it ruler , but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part . 1 
counterpoint : it be true that the founding fathers do design the complexion of the federal government in such a way that prevent power from be concentrate in one place . this make sense in the eighteenth century when the state have most of the power . however the power and responsibility of the federal government have expand dramatically . the united states be no longer best off with a slow government that create compromise . in a period where the pole of the party be increasingly powerful government be not just slow but glacial a be show by the crisis in 2011 over negotiation to raise the debt ceiling . 1 single party government would be able to get it legislation pass and could actually govern rather than merely engage in political manoeuvring to fend off the other party . 
point : congress be a bicameral body , with it constituent part , the house of representatives and senate , work largely independent of each other to create bill . however necessary for both the house and senate to pass law in identical form in order for it to become law . 1 a period of reconciliation be usually require to find a compromise between two different version of the same bill in order to maintain and improve what be best about propose reform and eliminate flaw before it become law . 2 
counterpoint : congress maybe a bicameral body , but it still need to be able to work effectively and have control split between the party be not conducive to this . reconciliation only truly work when there be a clear and coherent ideological programme to work around when make straighten difference between law . in an ever more polarised politics , divided government would be more likely to result in gridlock a be the case in 2011 the reconciliation . 
point : divided government create an imperative for compromise , encourage the party to work together for the best outcome . this can help to undermine the more visceral aspect of debate , with the contest for election be leave behind in order to focus on govern for the good of all americans . as a result the great american achievement have come when there have be broad bipartisan consensus . 1 
counterpoint : divided government may in theory provide an impetus for co operation but rather have be an opportunity for the divisiveness of the campaign to continue once the vote have be count . instead of co operation , what be commonly see be partisan tactic from both side of the aisle to discredit the other side , prevent compromise and lead to gridlock . in some extreme case a complete shutdown of the federal government have be force due to the impasse , such a in 1995 when clinton be unable to work with an obstinate republican congress . 1
