point : cannabis have be use for medicinal purpose for at least 5 , 000 year most frequently a an analgesic , that be to say it reduce pain . it also stimulate hunger and can be use a an anti emetic to control nausea and vomiting . as the dea administrative law judge francis l . young note in a 1988 ruling i , there be no evidence of a fatality result from the misuse of cannabis . indeed the dutch government currently permit doctor regulate by it ministry of health and welfare to prescribe cannabis to their patient . further , the dutch state have license a pharmaceutical firm to provide cannabis of a guaranteed level of purity to pharmacy and medical professional . ii 
counterpoint : government have a role in establish what be an acceptable level of behaviour within society . full in the knowledge that some people will use any substance responsibly and others less so , government make decision to protect their citizen and to show a lead . it be the settled will of most people in most country that cannabis be not a drug they consider acceptable for use in a modern society . furthermore , there be plenty of other drug that can be use for all of the us proposition have identify . legalizing cannabis for medical use would send out the message that it be safe to use when all practical evidence suggest that the social , if not the medical , ramification be anything but safe . proposition need to demonstrate a medical use for cannabis that cannot be meet by exist pharmaceutical . 
point : any drug , legal or illegal , can be use sensibly or it can be abuse . if society base it decision on the medical provision of drug on the presumption of abuse the shelf of most drugstore would be empty . the idea that the burden of proof should be set at demonstrate that nothing else can achieve the same result be absurd let s ban codeine because aspirin work just fine . drugs that have similar effect be distinguish accord to the speed , duration and efficacy of those effect , in addition to the drug s side effect . different individual experience the pain relieve effect of aspirin in different way . a wider range of individual may experience a longer lasting reduction in pain if take codeine . similarly , an even large number of individual respond positively to cannabis . 
counterpoint : of course all drug can be abuse but introduce one into the system full in the knowledge that it will be abuse be an entirely different matter . on the basis of the balance of probability , the moment any government say that cannabis be safe to use and , more than that , beneficial to health then every pothead in that jurisdiction have an excuse . 
point : the current legislation on drug use in most country be deliver without canvass medical opinion and under the influence of public hysteria and moral panic . seemingly logical but flawed theory link the use of soft drug to later use of harder variety cocain , amphetamins have often be use both to justify and to promote drug legislation . the apparent sense of these argument belie the fact that they have be repeatedly disproven i . 
counterpoint : ultimately , in most country where this be even under discussion , politician run away from this issue because there be no vote in it . the people don t want it and that view must be respect .
