point : trans fat , which be chemically engineer , decrease level of desirable cholesterol while increase harmful cholesterol ; they increase dangerous inflammation that can contribute to the onset of diabetes ; and they harden artery wall , which increase blood pressure . trans fat be much bad than even naturally occur , and still very unhealthy , saturated fat such a those find in butter . 
counterpoint : the alternative to trans fat be not really much healthy , and so unless the argument be to ban all fat , then there would be little point in ban trans fat , a they will just be replace with other fat which be almost a bad . health benefit result from the ban will be marginal or non existent . 
point : one of the purpose of government be identify possible threat to health and protect the people from these threat . the fact that some government regulation seem 'silly' or misplace , or cannot easily be understand by lay people be not a compelling argument for have no regulation at all , or for not have regulation in the case of trans fat . the commentator who denounce the 'nanny state' do not indicate what , if any , regulation or style of regulation they approve of . do they think there should be no inspection of restaurant by health inspector ? no regulation at all of food or drug safety by the food and drug administration ? some commentator think that people should be encourage to study the danger of trans fat and make their own judgement about what to eat . but people have limit time to do research on such matter . it make sense to delegate the research to a central authority , so that instead of 300 million people try to learn about trans fat and every other lurk menace , a handful of expert can make recommendation base on the likely response and desire of the average , informed citizen . 
counterpoint : the american fda considers the use of trans fat to be 'generally safe' . 1 the british food standards agency say the uk's low average consumption of trans fat make a complete ban unnecessary . 6 these organisation be already suppose to regulate foodstuff and monitor trans fat , if they agree that they need to act surely they would . 
point : it be easy and inexpensive to replace trans fat with other , less harmful product without significantly alter the taste of the food . kraft eliminate trans fat from it oreo cooky , with little public perception of any change in taste . 1 similarly , the wendy's restaurant chain test a new frying oil in 370 franchise , with customer not notice a difference in taste . denmark impose a national ban on trans fat with which even mcdonald's have comply . 1 replacements for trans fat will get cheap and cheap with time , a they be use more frequently and a the company that produce and distribute them increase their sale volume and be able to sell them for low price . 
counterpoint : a ban on trans fat will cause specific harm which cannot be fix by switch to other fat or food preparation method . particularly hard hit would be small business , who would struggle to make the transition because they no not have the budget to research alternative way to make their product taste the same and so be likely to end up at a disadvantage compare to their big rival . moreover all business would suffer from reduce shelf life for their product . 7
