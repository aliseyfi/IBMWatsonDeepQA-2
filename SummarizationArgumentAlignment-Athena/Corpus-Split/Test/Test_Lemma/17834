point : it be the developed world that have the capability to combat climate change . it be they that have most to cut per caput . more importantly it be these developed country that have the research capabilities to come up with the necessary technology to make the economy greener , to produce renewable energy , to mitigate against the effect of disaster . moreover these same place be the country that have the finance available to fund these activity ; not only fund the research into the solution but also the financial resource to put them into action all around the world . poor country turn to the powerful financial centre such a london and new york to finance large project , the same will be the case with project to mitigate climate change . finally these country have the expertise to put these new invention and project into practice ; they have the expert to work out the best place to build , to advise on building , and make sure the project do not have unintended side effect . as the nation with the great capability , develop nation have an increase responsibility to act . 
counterpoint : while develop country be more capable of contribute to combat global warming , their obligation to do so do not increase . the ease with which a party can accomplish a task do not determine it responsibility to do so . 
point : the most developed nation be also the most powerful in the international community ; they have a duty to lead by example . even if india and china be rapidly rise the developed country between them be still the most powerful economy . if developing nation perceive that more developed one be not act to combat climate change , they will have no imperative to act . this be because some develop country such a china or india want to maximize their development capacity in order to compete with developed country . they be only likely to cut carbon emission if those develop nation they compete with do so first that way their attempt to compete be not jeopardise . the climate change talk that have achieve relatively little have show this to be the case china have only show willing to do a deal if the united states commit itself first . 
counterpoint : china and india , although develop nation , be actually very politically powerful . both be g20 nation , and the g20 include both developed and develop nation . they have sufficient potential for leadership due to their size and economic power and therefore could equally be an example to other nation . these country would be a good example to other develop country a the method they use to tackle climate change would be directly applicable to other develop nation whereas action by developed nation be much more likely to take advantage of high tech solution that may not be universally applicable . 
point : it be through heavy industrialisation that develop country be develop since they contribute more to climate change , they have a great obligation to resolve it . climate change have largely be cause by long term emission by developed country . while china be now the world s big co2 emitter and other develop country emission be rapidly rise historically the vast majority of emission have be from develop nation . from 1900 to 2004 the united states produce 314 , 772 million metric tonne of co2 compare to china s 89 , 243 million metric tonne and while india now produce more co2 germany over the same period emit three time as much . 1 as co2 can remain in the atmosphere for a long time , about 50 will be remove within 30 year , but 20 or more may remain for thousand of year , the history of emission be as relevant a current emission . 2 since they contribute more of the damage , and since each nation have a responsibility for the harm it have cause , develop nation have an increase obligation to combat climate change . 
counterpoint : it be unknown that emit greenhouse gas cause climate change until the 1980s over a century after the industrial revolution . developing nation be not initially aware of the damage they be cause , therefore the harm be unintentional . it be unfair to retrospectively punish these nation for something that be unknown to be harmful when it be do . the responsibility should therefore be base upon either current emission or at most emission from the period in which the damage cause be know and emission could have be reduce . 
point : developed country emit the most greenhouse gas per caput , in 2008 the us emit 17 . 9 tonne compare to china s 5 . 3 ton per person , 1 and therefore a reduction from these nation be both easy and have a great impact than from develop nation . countries with high co2 emission can reduce these emission through lifestyle change that do not reduce citizen quality of life , for example simply by reduce the amount they drive walk or go by bike when only go a short distance whereas for develop nation reduction either have to work out way of do thing more efficiently or accept that living standard will be affect a most people s lifestyle be already low carbon , the challenge be to keep it that way while improve quality of life . 
counterpoint : many develop nation who be exempt from the kyoto protocol be in fact use more fossil fuel per caput than develop nation who be attempt to cut down . countries with large endowment of oil for example be profligate in it use so qatar emit 49 . 1 ton per caput . while china s emission of 5 . 3 tone be much less than the united states there be other developed country that produce similar amount such a switzerland at 5 . 3 and israel at 5 . 2 ton per caput . nations such a china and india could make an equally meaningful contribution due to their sheer size but also because incorporate green energy into the industry in a still develop nation be easy than try to change a developed one . these county will need to build new power plant anyway a they experience more demand for electricity , they might as well make these new plant green . 
point : developing nation need to be allow to develop without the burden of emission restriction . developed nation have be allow to industrialize at whatever pace they wish , and through industrialization produce emission . despite have be pollute the atmosphere a a result of industrialization since the early 19th century develop nation only begin comprehensively limit pollution after world war ii in order to reduce smog through regulation such a the 1955 air pollution control act and 1963 clean air act in the united states 1 and many developed country have yet to regulate their co2 emission . 
counterpoint : this make the flawed assumption that development have to be dirty to lead to meaningful advance in living standard . this be not the case . in the 19th century the developed world have no choice but to develop in a dirty way a there be no alternative power source that could provide enough energy . today there be numerous green energy source that be every bit as efficient a the coal fire power that be use for the developed world s industrial revolution .
