point : there be three reason why this be the case . first , terrorist group may threaten jury member see argument 2 for more detail . second , terrorism may politicize the jury see argument 3 for more detail . third , the state may be limit in what information it can provide if juror be present . the government may be unable or unwilling to present classified information for fear of intelligence leak ; for example if it do not want to reveal intelligence method and source to the public . this reluctance may make it very difficult to prosecute terrorist . the implication be that the unique national security issue terrorism trial pose may make jury untenable if we ever want to convict terrorist of serious crime . 11laura k . donohue , terrorism and trial by jury : the vices and virtues of british and american criminal law 
counterpoint : first , eliminate trial by jury may make other country less willing to cooperate with u , reduce the amount of information we have about international terrorism . for example , the united states decision to eliminate jury from terrorism trial result in other country be more reluctant to cooperate e . g . germany delay the extradition of two suspected terrorist because of that decision . second , eliminate trial by jury give the democratic country le of a moral high ground in advocate that other country often country from which terrorists come adopt liberal democratic structure something which already establish liberal democracy generally regard a be in their self interest . third , refuse to grant trial by jury to suspect terrorist may make other country less willing to grant our own citizen fair trial when they be abroad . 
point : it be very difficult to carry out trial by jury if people involve in the case continuously attempt to tamper with the jury , or unduly influence it decision . for example , the uk home office have state that try to protect juror from tamper can be extremely disruptive to the juror themselves , who may in extreme case need police protection 24 hour a day . cases involve international terrorism , drug smuggling or organize crime be the most likely to present such problem 1 . in the infamous trial of italian anarchist vanzetti and sacco , one of the juror have a bomb thrown at his house , despite a huge number of security measure take by the massachusetts government 2 . another example be the 2008 case of a large armed robbery at heathrow . after three mistrial , which cost 22m and the last of which collapse after a serious attempt at jury tampering , it be decide that the case would be try by a judge alone 3 . if eliminate the jury be the only way to ensure that a a trial occurs and b juror be safe , particularly when it be the defendants' fault that a fair trial by jury be untenable , it may be necessary to do so . 
counterpoint : there be procedural way of mitigate this concern that be less severe than eliminate the jury altogether . possible way of deal with jury intimidation tamper include 1 have retrial in case where jury tampering occur , 2 attempt to increase the degree of juror anonymity , for example by seat juror where they cannot be see , and 3 by have high penalty for jury tampering and intimidation . the second way be probably the most effective , and american court have find that in case where jury tampering pose a serious threat , it do not interfere with the defendant's right to a fair trial . 11laura k . donohue , terrorism and trial by jury : the vices and virtues of british and american criminal law 
point : juries be not technically train in evaluate evidence . 1 additionally , judge be train to recognize and suppress their own prejudice , evaluate information give to them , recognize prosecutorial strategy etc . , good allow them to make objective decision . furthermore , some study suggest that jury actually work against the innocent ; a 1979 study find that more than 5 per cent of defendant find guilty by jury be consider by professional to have be convict in questionable circumstance . 2 this be hardly surprising give that juror be ordinary citizen who be force to sit through what be often dull and protracted trial , and who may have little interest in actually listen to what be be say joanne frail , a juror convict for contempt of court state that she 'drew more than she write during the trial ' . 3 perhaps we should trust in the expertise of screened and trained justice instead . 
counterpoint : not only be trial by jury a very important check on the justice system , but evidence also suggest that jury be fair and effective . first of all , a explain in the opparguments , trial by jury be an extremely important check in the criminal justice system . eliminating it would be a grave threat to justice . but second , to address the more practical concern raise by the proposition , study actually suggest that jury be fair and effective . recent uk ministry of justice research find that jury tend to be objective and non bias , and that case base on the strong evidence be also those case result in the high conviction rate . 1 
point : juries be very expensive and time consuming , and court may not be capable of use them for all trial . indeed , in both the uk and the united states , minor or petty offence can be try without jury such offense be define differently in different place ; in the us petty offence be those carry less than 6 month prison time or a fine of 5000 1 . that be because in densely populated area , the court be simply not capable of handle all trial with jury 2 . but even beyond the limitation already in place , there may be more small scale trial which could function without jury , and free up resource . according to british government crime advisor louise casey , if all of the either or case case deal with minor offence which can be try in either a crown or a magistrate court be shift entirely to the latter , britain would save 30m in the cost of set up jury . such money could be use to help out victim of serious crime , or otherwise improve the justice system 3 . for example , if more time and money be free up in the united states , the court might not need to pressure so many defendant into plea bargaining , or plead guilty without a trial in exchange for less harsh sentencing or the dropping of other charge in 1996 , about two third of american criminal case disposition involve guilty plea 4 . that would allow more trial to take place , and more justice to be do . 
counterpoint : trial by jury be too important to sacrifice it for the sake of efficiency . as explain in the opposition case , trial by jury be one of the cornerstone of just democratic court . there be other way to free up resource : perhaps if we put few people in prison we could spend more time and money ensure that the right people get there . as judge mcquillan write , dedication , hard work , planning and resource be the mean for deal effectively and rationally with calendar delay . 1 
point : especially in case of nationalist conflict or terrorist attack , it may be extremely difficult to have a non biased jury . in northern island , for example , juror may sympathize with violent offender and acquit them despite a preponderance of evidence . similarly , it can be a struggle to appoint non bias jury for terrorism trial post 9 11 . in 2003 , the lackwana six be accuse of aid a foreign terrorist organization . the magistrate note that understandably , the infamous , dastardly and tragic deed and event of september 11 , 2001 have cause a maelstrom of human emotion to . . . create a human reservoir of strong emotional feeling such a fear , anxiety and hatred as well a a feeling of paranoia . . . these be strong emotion of a negative nature which , if not appropriately check , cause the ability of one to properly reason to . . . be blind . questions about jury impartiality have be raise in multiple similar case , even lead some defendant to claim that they plead guilty out of resignation that the jury would inevitably be bias and refuse to acquit . 1 the implication be that in some trial , jury may be unable to make impartial decision , thus make the trial unfair . the only way for justice to be do , in such case , be to allow a judge to decide the verdict . 
counterpoint : first , there be check in place to help prevent biased decision and second , the less objective nature of jury be not necessarily bad . first , in most jury system , a judge can overturn a guilty verdict if s he believe that the jury make a faulty decision1 . judges can also order retrial in case of guilty verdict , if they believe there be procedural error . furthermore , in most country there be a phase of the jury selection process in which both the prosecution and defence can object to a juror ; in many country each side get a specific number of these unconditional 'peremptory challenge . ' that allow blatantly bias juror to be exclude . perhaps most importantly , at least with jury there be multiple people make the decision , a oppose to a sole judge : there be no reason to assume that a lone judge will be less biased , just because of his 'professional training . 'but second , have a subjective body make the decision be not necessarily bad . we obviously don't want people to be sway by unchecked prejudice , but one of the point of have a jury be that it allow all part of the community to participate in the judicial process and provide input that disconnect and often homogenous government official cannot . for example , the diplock court establish in 1970s northern ireland eliminate jury , and along with them , jury bias . this result in high conviction rate for violent offender , but also have the negative effect of exclude the catholic minority from the administration of justice and judge bias remain , a evidence by the failure of the court to eliminate the gap between catholic and protestant conviction rate . 2
