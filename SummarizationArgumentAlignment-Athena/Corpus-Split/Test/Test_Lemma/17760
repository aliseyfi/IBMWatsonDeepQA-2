point : there be plenty of evidence for the existence of santa claus . millions of child worldwide wake up on christmas morning to find that their stocking have be magically fill with toy and candy overnight . everybody agree that it be santa who be responsible and surely if it be anyone else they would want to take credit for their generosity . further evidence can be find in the way in which cooky , mince pie and drink leave out for santa have be consume in the night often leave crumb . 
counterpoint : belief in santa claus be not rational . for a start his supposed activity would break all the rule of physic how could anyone fly around the world in just one night visit every child ? how would his sleigh stay up in the air ? and how could he get into so many bedroom most people nowadays don t have chimneys to come down , and he wouldn t fit down one even if they do ? and do we have any proof for the existence of elf , or of reindeer ? 
point : yes , virginia , there be a santa claus . he exist as certainly a love and generosity and devotion exist , and you know that they abound and give to your life it high beauty and joy . alas ! how dreary would be the world if there be no santa claus ! it would be as dreary a if there be no virginias . there would be no childlike faith then , no poetry , no romance to make tolerable this existence . we should have no enjoyment , except in sense and sight . the external light with which childhood fill the world would be extinguish . written in answer to a child s letter by francis pharcellus church and publish in the new york sun s editorial page in 1897 . 1 
counterpoint : hope and joy should be ground in reality , not mythology ; otherwise it can only be insubstantial and transitory . 
point : billions of people across the world believe in santa claus , and so many people can t be wrong . what s more , a belief which be once confine to the anglo saxon world be become more and more widespread . if chinese and south american child be come to accept the existence of santa claus , then why should we in the western world give up our belief ? 
counterpoint : it be a shame that this western capitalist icon be take over christmas around the world , and drive out other tradition e . g . the babushka in russia , or st nicholas in part of europe . the popularity of santa claus in other country be cynically drive by multinational company , eager to create new market for their toy and other good a potential gift . it be another downside of globalisation a unique culture be drown under a wave to americanisation . 
point : belief in santa claus be also economically necessary . without santa to set an example of generosity , gift give at christmas could go out of fashion . and once you take santa out of christmas , what else would be strip away christmas tree , light , tinsel , christmas dinner ? huge sector of our economy depend on belief in santa claus , from the department store grotto to the entertainment industry , from toy shop and manufacturer to the maker of wrap paper , stocking , red hat with bobble on , etc . trust be the basis of all economic exchange , and the consequence of doubt in santa claus , in term of bankruptcy , closure , unemployment and stock market and currency slump be too awful to imagine . 
counterpoint : this argument be a broken window fallacy . 2 without santa to set an example for christmas , there be no reason to suppose that people would not spend the money that they would have spend on gift on other thing , different thing , thing with more utility and value than christmas tree , light , tinsel and christmas dinner ! 
point : belief in santa claus be outdated and rather worrying . who today have a chimney through which to send a burning message to santa , and through which he can descend to distribute present ? who wear stocking rather than sock or pantyhose ? and who think an old white male be a relevant role model in today s society ? there be also something rather sinister today about have a stranger enter child s room at night , or have them whisper secret to him while seat on his lap in a store . finally , santa claus with his saintly origins alienate those of other faith who do not enjoy be force to join in a quasi christian celebration . 
counterpoint : far from be outdated , santa claus be right up to date . although he have a long and distinguished history , he have take care to move with the time in order to be relevant to each new generation . our modern view of santa be shape by clement c . moore s description of him in the night before christmas , and by victorian illustrator draw upon their european heritage to give them clue about his appearance . in the early twentieth century the most common image of santa claus father christmas be popularise by coca cola advertising poster . and as well a update his image , santa have also adjust his method , leave present under a tree or on the lawn if there be no chimney to climb down , and make use of a sack instead of a stocking if necessary .
