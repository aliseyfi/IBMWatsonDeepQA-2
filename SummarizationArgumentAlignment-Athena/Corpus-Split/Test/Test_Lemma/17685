point : if child be religious , they should be allow to wear the clothes that express their religion , but school a uniform can often restrict this . religious belief can be extremely valuable and important to many child , give their life a great deal of meaning and structure and inspire them to work hard and behave compassionately in a school environment . some religion place a great deal of value upon worn symbol of faith , such a turban , headdress and bracelet . when a school demand that a child remove these symbol , it inadvertently attack something central to that child s life . this may cause the child to see her school and her faith a mutually exclusive institution 1 . vulnerable young people should not be force into an adversarial relationship with their school , a close , collaborative involvement with teaching and learn technique will greatly effect a child s ability to adapt , learn and acquire new skill in the future . 
counterpoint : some school do have different rule for religious student , so that those student can express their belief . for example , a school might let muslim girls wear some of their religious item of clothing mixed with the school uniform e . g . , reading girls' school 2 . 
point : rather than have school uniform , why not have a dress code instead ? this have all the benefit of uniform without the many disadvantage . while uniform force all child to wear the same clothes , dress code give student a lot of choice what to wear . only a few unsuitable thing be ban for example , gang color , very short skirt , crop top , bare shoulder , etc . 
counterpoint : dress code be a half way house that do not work . it do not make student look at all uniform and it do not show what school they be from . in the united states there have be a move away from allow either no uniform or dress code towards have school uniform . 6 
point : school uniform be often not very comfortable or practical . in state school school for which parent don't have to pay fee in the u . k . , for example , girl often have to wear dress or skirt , when they might feel more comfortable in trouser , and boy often have to wear button up shirt and tie , which can also be uncomfortable for active child 7 . in independent school , uniform be often even more impractical and uncomfortable , with blazer or even tailcoat for the child to wear 8 . 
counterpoint : a lot of school have a choice of uniform so that child can wear what they feel most comfortable in . for example , in australia , which be a very hot country , school often have a summer uniform of clothes that be more comfortable in the hot weather 9 . this mean that in summer , child might be allow to wear short instead of trouser and short sleeved instead of long sleeved shirt . 
point : if a school have a uniform , parent be expect to buy it , and then buy a new one every time their child outgrow the last . this can be expensive . it have be report that parent in south africa 10 , australia 11 , and the u . k 12 . have to pay a lot of money for their children's school uniform , and it be probably the same in other country too . 
counterpoint : in many country , parent can apply for help with the cost of school uniform . for example , in the u . k . , parent who don't earn a lot of money can get money from the government to help pay for their child's school uniform 13 . in australia , the australian scholarships group , which specialise in help parent save money when it come to their children's education , have tip for parent to get their child's uniform cheaper . 14 
point : article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights state that everyone have the right to freedom of opinion and expression 18 . children's freedom of expression be restrict by school uniform , because child who have to wear the same clothing a every other child in their school be not able to express their individuality and creativity . we should get rid of school uniform so that all child can express themselves freely . 
counterpoint : schools can foster creativity and individuality without get rid of school uniform . there be many school with a uniform which still support creativity and individuality with child initiated independent learning , and other scheme which encourage child to think for themselves 19 , 20 . also , if child be participate in creative activity like art , it be surely well for them to wear sensible clothes , and it's easy to make sure all child be wear sensible clothes if they all have to wear the same uniform .
