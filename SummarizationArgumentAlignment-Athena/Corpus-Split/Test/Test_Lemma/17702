point : to member of ethnic minority group overt public celebration of christmas can seem like a form of aggressive evangelism . it be an ethical duty of both christians and society more generally to respect the belief of others , this make the term happy holidays a much more appropriate greeting a it take into account the mid winter festival of other faith and culture such a hanukkah , kwanza , diwali , eid , ashura , to name a few . the red cross in 2003 ban nativity decoration from it british shop because it state that an alignment to a particular religion could compromise it ability to work in conflict situation around the world1 . it be a christian ideal to be tolerant of others , and limit the use of the term christmas in favor of more inclusive term would be an incredible display of this , the term christmas would not be ban , but it use limit to specific occasion in which it specifically refer to christian base activity rather than the general celebration that be see throughout the mid winter period . 1 mirza , m . christmas be ban ! or be it ? spiked : 2 
counterpoint : christianity be entirely respectful to others , this can be see particular in contrast to extreme faction of other religion which desire complete dominance . christians and western nation do not seek to ban the celebration of other religious festival , however this do not give consent to mothball all winter festival into a singular name , many other religion as well a the christianity be against this . while the feeling of ethnic minority group should be take into consideration it must be remember that christianity be often the dominant religion in many western country , christianity be on the whole not try to aggressively force their religion onto others , however if a majority wish to celebrate it they should be allow to , should hanukkah become more dominant that would equally rise to the top , the expression of religion on the whole should not be regulate , all religion should have the right to celebrate their distinctness throughout the mid winter period . 
point : public celebration and festival be all either organize or fund by the state , or otherwise have to gain their approval before they can go ahead . therefore , if the state be to decide that christmas celebration be to be ban , it would be a fairly simple process to ensure they be stop . the british city of birmingham in 1998 alter the name of it christmas festival to 'winterval' , prove it can be done1 . at public school , state have a mean to inform principal that christmas celebration will not be permit . punishments to individual principal whose school do not obey could act a a deterrent to certain individual inform their teacher to act contrary to the ban and thereafter claim deniability . 1daily 1 mail . campaign for a real christmas . 1 
counterpoint : such a ban would be impossible to enforce and therefore achieve little . christmas celebration be not consign to those in school and public place . a state cannot prevent individual and community from celebrate christmas an attempt to do so would merely encourage those celebrate to do so on a grander scale . such a tactic therefore would achieve the opposite of it intention draw attention to the christian ness of the population and encouraging christians to flaunt their religion and celebrate their christmas . muslim fear in the uk that it would lead to a backlash against them be well founded1 . if the state be truly concerned about integration of religious community , they would celebrate christmas openly each year and a whole host of other festival in between . 
point : christmas celebration in the western world , hold in school and public square , do not respect the right of those who be not religious . for school child who do not share the majority christian faith , christmas celebration require either their participation when they do not want to , through coercion , or their non participation and therefore isolation whilst everyone else celebration their inclusiveness . states should instead be sponsor and celebrate event that everyone can join in equally , regardless of religion , race or class . 'happy holidays' be a generic term for the december break that do not discriminate between christians and non christians , or indeed between the religious and the non religious . furthermore , even christmas symbol like the christmas symbol could be co adopt to appeal to non christians ; boston in 2005 re name it christmas tree to 'holiday tree'1 . a tolerant , multi cultural state would not stop there , but ban the public naming of christmas and celebrate the 'holidays' instead . 1 bazar , e . trimming 'christmas' from tree stirs debate . usa today : 4 
counterpoint : the celebration of christmas be only infringe on either of those principle if it be the only event that be celebrate publically . that , however , be not the case . prominent religious event like the hindu diwali , the muslim eid , the jewish hanukah and the christian easter be all celebrate at different time of the year , by member of all faith 
point : the christmas break be no longer a christian festival , but a multi cultural celebration during christmas ; the state should not be sponsor event specific to christians during a holiday for all religious and non religious citizen . christmas be now celebrate not only in western nation but the world over , it be celebrate not only by individual which be not christian but whole nation which do not subscribe to the christian belief system . the holiday have transcend it origin , while it still represent some conceptual christian notion it be no longer for the most part a christian festival . much of the symbolism now use have more relation to pagan tradition than christian one with thing such a the christmas tree and mistletoe originate from the pre christian religion , in addition other common symbol have come from popular culture such a snowman and reindeer . very rarely now be the traditional symbol of a christian christmas actually display publicly or even in the home of christians themselves , with many prefer the symbolism of the modern multi cultural christmas . a uk study find that three out of four employer have ban christmas decoration because they be concern not to offend other faiths1 . it seem only logical to describe public display by other terminology a this would reflect more truly on the celebration of the winter period . 1 furedi , f . do they know it's christmas ? spiked : 5 
counterpoint : christmas be no longer solely a christian festival , but that be in fact more of a reason to retain it history and cherish the inclusiveness of the celebration . while it be certainly true that christmas be celebrate by many more people than just christians , this inclusiveness should be note by the state and use a an opportunity to bring community and religion together . people who be not christian who engage with the festival will still know the reason behind the celebration , the birth of christ and will more widely know what he do with his time on earth . it be true that mixed in with christian symbology there be now many other symbol from a non christian non religious background , what this demonstrate be the liberalness of the christian faith show that it can adapt to modern trend as long a the core message remain , this should not be exploit a a way to neutralize the power of the religion through political correctness restraint but should be applaud and garter respect . due to this ability to adapt christmas can be enjoy by all and still maintain it christian root without the need to change the terminology of the festival .
