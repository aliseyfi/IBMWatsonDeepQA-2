point : the philosophical basis of entitlement for pay be derive from the notion that if something come into be a the product of an individual s labor , then that individual be entitle to the profit and benefit of such a product because it existence be resultant of that individual s labor 1 . that in this case the labor be on service do not make any difference , the product of the housewife s labor be that the child be look after and domestic matter be all sort . this be beneficial to society a housewife in addition to help their own family be likely to have the time to help out others through volunteering , through look after other s child after school etc . 
counterpoint : not all labor be reward with wage or pay despite the fact that good and service be product of say labor . for example , voluntary and charity work be both type of labor that be not pay . the distinction be where the work be do and the obligation owe to people a a result . home keep be a voluntary job that have it own form of remuneration family connection etc . in the same way that volunteer and charity work do e . g . feeling a though you be part of something large . 
point : gender stereotype dictate that the woman s place be in the home and that that be an inferior position in the social hierarchy than that of the male s corporate bread winner status . the stereotype be particularly damaging to woman s expectation for themselves and the way society treat woman . 
counterpoint : paying housewife would not make much difference to image of woman and family life , and could even make thing bad rather than good . by pay housewife , monetize the position of housewife and home keeper , the state re affirm the idea that the only true value a person can hold be an economic one and that the only way to assess and quantify the value of an individual or their impact be through financial mean . re enforce such a financial centric version of worth and value be dangerous to housewife , who , by any reasonable expectation , will never make as much a private sector professional such a ceos . it simply re enforce the inferiority of house keep and the role of the family unit in society . 
point : one of the most important factor of oppression of woman s right , particularly in the developing world , be dependence 1 . women be often confine to the home by force , lack of opportunity or social stigma , on behalf of their husband . when she be not pay , a housewife must rely on her husband for money , especially if she have child she be expect to take care of . economic empowerment allow far freedom for woman in country where woman be confine to the home 2 . by make woman economic actor , you empower them to engage in different social structure and hold a stake and position in the centre of economic power . this be the most empowering tool one can offer woman in most country around the world 3 . 
counterpoint : it be highly unlikely that this can be implement in any country where female empowerment be as restrict a be discuss . if woman be a dependent and oppress a the proposition suggest , the political will to pass such legislation will not exist . even if a law be pass , the pay would be very low , and so the wife would still rely on the husband s income .
