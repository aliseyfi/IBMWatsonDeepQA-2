point : media can be one of the most important factor in democratic development . if government successfully control the medium , they can direct information towards their constituent that cast the regime in an undeniably good light . they can prevent news of faked election , protest , violence , repression , and arrest from ever reach the people subject to those violation 1 . without external source of information people do not question government propaganda , which decrease the likelihood that they advocate for their civil liberty and democracy . the internet promote the free flow of information that lead to social consciousness and enhances democracy . news of political corruption and scandal in china can go viral in a matter of minute among it 540 million internet user 2 . even when the government block certain website , and make avid use of firewall for censorship , upload video to facebook and youtube , and post to twitter can allow information to be disseminate within the country . once information be accessible it be almost impossible for the government to continue to censor the internet . for example , in the most recent egyptian protest , a information leak out of the country via social networking site , cell phone picture and video be show on international news broadcast , make it difficult for the government to spin the situation in a positive light 3 . the internet provide a place to find information , and also a place to discuss and debate it with others . the latter be the essential step to truly shifting view . the internet promote free medium which be essential to both create and maintain a function democracy a it promote government transparency . 
counterpoint : governments still successfully censor information . take china for example . often the government shut down facebook and twitter , arrest blogger , and take down content . terms like tiananmen square and inner mongolia provide no search result because of the protest that have go on there1 governments ability to censor information be advance . therefore the idea that the internet promote the flow of unbiased information be not necessarily true , which counter the claim that the internet promote democracy . further , the internet be not always use for access to western news source , but instead , over 500 million site in the index of search engine be pornographic . in 2003 25 of internet use be for access porn . five of the twenty most visited internet site be download site for video game and porn 2 . the internet be not largely use for access to information , but instead other forbidden resource , and therefore cannot be directly link to democratic development . 
point : the promotion of democracy be not only about form new democracy ; strengthen exist democratic institution around the globe . to do so , transparency and government citizen communication be necessary . britain have set up two website that achieve exactly that . writetothem . com be a website where people can figure out who their parliamentary representative be , and write to them about their problem in an effort to create a strong relationship , and channel of communication between mps and their constituents1 . 130 , 000 people be use the website in 2009 . theyworkforyou . com be another website where people can find out who their representative be , and then read about their recent action in parliament . this site receive between 200 , 000 and 300 , 000 hit per month2 . elections be also strengthen by the internet . voting can be conduct online which make the process easy and can reduce intimidation at the poll . now that politician have website , their policy platform can be more easily access and understand by voter . increasing information and communication between leader and their constituent contribute to a more transparent system and therefore a healthy democracy . the internet be not only useful for promote movement for democratic reform in authoritarian country , but also for make democracy more effective in democratic country . 
counterpoint : to use such website government already need to be commit to democracy . promoting democracy in already democratic country be irrelevant . countries that be not democratic , and seek to maintain autocratic rule will not be impact by the availability of those resource and harness the internet only for continue repression 1 . 
point : another extremely important requirement for successful opposition movement advocate democratic reform be the ability to organize mass number of people . it be one thing if you hate your government , but don t think anyone else do . it be entirely different if you can access the thought of thousand of others and realize that you be in fact not alone 1 . proportionally the number of people benefit from repressive authoritative regime be very small in comparison to the people who be suffer . therefore , if the people who be hurt by the regime realize the number that they have , it spell trouble for the government . the internet have 2 billion user , and 950 million people have mobile broadband 2 . mobile phone with pay a you go access plan be more available and affordable than ever before . protesters do not need to own a computer : they can access social networking and news site from their phone . the internet mean that opposition group don t have to be organize under a particular leader , a there can now be many leader and various cause that fit under the same umbrella and band together . these loose connection , a in egypt , strengthen the movement 3 . the internet also reduce the cost of organization , which can be the difference between success and failure 4 . in the revolution in egypt and tunisia which call for democracy , the internet be first use to create event on facebook to increase the number of people aware of and attend protest 5 . then the video , photograph , and twitter post that become available on the internet increase the support for the movement a citizen become aware of the violence the government be subject the country to . the internet allow user to communicate , then organize demonstration , and then grow the movement . all of these function of the internet be essential factor of a grassroots push for democratic reform . 
counterpoint : the internet be only a place for coordination and cannot replace real life action so if people be not willing to take to the street , then the internet be not go to help and even without the internet , disgruntled mass can still make their point know , a in the french revolution1 . egypt shut down internet and phone service during part of the revolution , yet it continue indicate that this movement be not base online2 . therefore the internet be not necessarily the force that propel people towards change . sms have be a very important part of the organization of these protest , which be entirely separate from the internet3 . close to 5 billion people use cell phone and sms , therefore the impact of the cell phone cannot be distinguish from the internet so it be inaccurate to say that the internet be contribute to democratization when it be very possibly thanks to mobile phones4 . 
point : the internet do not only make information available to oppressed people within a country , but also communicate that situation to the rest of the world . people also learn about other authoritarian and democratic government around the world . for example , the internet allow information about tunisia s revolution to reach egypt , which make it clear that overthrow a government be entirely possible1 . information about the action of other country , and their government can lead to a push for democratic reform around the world . in addition , a information flow out of a country it become more difficult for the globe s power to ignore the event that be ensue , and make it more likely that they will take action . this action can create the internal and external pressure necessary for democratic reform a be see in both the revolution in egypt and tunisia2 . contact between country can also have a more subtle impact as well . it enhance communication between open and closed society particularly in the form of business , which can bring about an exchange of value . thanks in part to the internet ; western firm increasingly own large share of middle eastern and east asian business , put pressure on government to remove their economic protectionism measure and to allow great transparency . for example , while china be not a democracy it have make some government and economic reform that be on the right track3 . 
counterpoint : for many country , communication with outside actor do not make any difference . iran have some internet freedom and access to outside information , yet president ahmadinejad cast the west a a great evil try to destroy iran's culture1 . the government remain a theocracy and while there have be some protest , there be many that still support the system of governance2 . additionally , china may have make reform , but it be not a democracy even though they have extensive contact with the west3 . therefore , contact do not necessarily indicate that value will be adopt . when it come to information flow out of oppressive country , the international community might make matter bad . when the west get involve in local movement , often it can make leader hold a tight grip on their power , and turn the blame for the situation on the west lead to violence , and hinder democratic development . this be similar to the situation in libya4 .
