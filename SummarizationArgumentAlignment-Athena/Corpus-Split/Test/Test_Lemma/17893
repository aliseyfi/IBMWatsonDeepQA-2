point : psbs create unique content which private broadcaster would be unable to produce a they strive for mass market appeal to satisfy the demand place upon them by commercial interest look to purchase advertising . psbs create more educational and minority output which enrich society rather than just entertain it . 
counterpoint : commercial broadcaster have to directly interact with their audience to ensure that the programming be provide be what the public actually want to consume . commercial broadcaster have to pull in audience whereas the partly publicly fund psbs have a financial safety net which allow them to push content onto the audience in an elitist manner and allow them to essentially tell their audience what be good for them . it be also erroneous to suggest that minority taste be not serve by commercial broadcaster . technology have allow for a great number of broadcast channel and a a result many of these specialize to cater for particular niche , for example , the history channel . 
point : as well a air program for minority which the private broadcaster would not provide , by provide and present content in a manner that resonate with the society in which they operate and by offer universal and affordable access to such content see definition in the introduction psbs can also help bring people together and thus promote social cohesion . psbs be able to put people and society first before financial and commercial interest . for example the bbc in it 2005 building public value report state that it aim to serve it audience not just a consumer , but a member of a wider society , with programme and service which , while seek to inform , educate and entertain audience , also serve wide public purpose . 1 
counterpoint : psbs be a thing of the past . people no longer sit around the television together . commercial broadcaster provide more cultural freedom and choice for people . the idea of tv bring a nation together no longer hold any merit in fragmented globalizing medium market where individualism dominate . tv be now more often than not a solitary experience rather than a communal one . this can be demonstrate by the amount of tv set own per household . a market report from nielsen show that in 1980 49 of us household have only 1 tv set and that 15 have three or more . compare that with data from 2010 and only 17 of people in the us own only 1 tv set whereas 55 have 3 or more . 1 
point : advertising limit the type of programming and story commercial network will run a they may fear lose lucrative advertising deal with large corporation . as psbs do not rely solely on advertising they be more likely to air program which be critical towards the practice of large corporation and serve the public interest . for example , in august 2011 , pbs air food inc . , a documentary that lift the veil on the us food industry expose the underbelly that s hidden from the american consumer with the consent of the government s regulatory agency . 1 
counterpoint : the same could be say equally about psbs . they be unlikely to broadcast item which may damage their funding stream . in the case of network use the underwrite model they be also unlikely to broadcast thing which underwriter do not approve of . due to the fragment and competitive broadcasting market place there will always be a home for program which challenge business and other entity if there be enough public interest in the give issue .
