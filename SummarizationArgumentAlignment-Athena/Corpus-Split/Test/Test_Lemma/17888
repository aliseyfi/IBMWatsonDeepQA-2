point : from it early day , the obama administration have strive to change the tide of us foreign policy , by move away from america s unilateralism and dismissiveness of other nation . 1 its treatment of it foe be a product of that same attitude . the general policy not to meet or negotiate without precondition be akin to dangle a spot at the table like some sort of prize that foreign leader need to work for . in international law , all state be sovereign and equal with no one have a right to interfere with other s internal affair . this mean that all leader should treat each other with respect and deference . 
counterpoint : while legally all the world s leader be equal , morally they be not . for decade , the us have be the standard of what it mean to be a liberal democracy and have respect your citizen right and liberty . that be not arrogance ; it s moral leadership . this be a vision that the us should aggressively promote in it foreign policy . the president of the united state should not meet a equal with tyrant and dictator who oppress their own people , and endanger world peace and security . not unless these people give any indication they be even vaguely commit to move toward some common goal . 
point : no government be monolithic . in every regime there will be moderate force willing to use diplomacy and negotiation and extremist element that do not . by demand that precondition be fulfil before a meeting , all power be give to the extremist . israel palestine be an example of this . by often demand that violence cease before negotiation can take place , the us and israel give a veto over negotiation to hamas , who be the perpetrator of violence . they get to decide if and when negotiation take place . instead , the president of the united states should always try to engage and strengthen moderate within these regime . 
counterpoint : not allow any meeting with the president do not mean no negotiation can take place . groundwork can be do by diplomat , negotiator , third party , and even high rank administration official from the state department , like the secretary of state . such tactic can also strengthen moderate . however , a meeting with the president be a powerful symbol , and it should only take place if either significant headway have be make , or if the leader of these regime be fully commit to negotiating , which they can prove by agree to precondition . 
point : no country be likely to agree to condition that will significantly reduce it bargaining power once it get to the table . it would be diplomatically foolish to agree to precondition that would essentially be the subject of the negotiation and the reason why the negotiation be need in the fist place 1 . if north korea agree to freeze development of it nuclear arsenal , or if iran agree to stop it nuclear enrichment programme , once the meeting between the two leader take place , the position from which they start negotiate would be significantly weak than the us s . 
counterpoint : that be true . but that be mostly the case with precondition that be strategically flaw or an attempt at political gamesmanship , when a leader make outrageous demand the other party cannot possibly meet in order to paint them a unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate . however , choose carefully , precondition can set talk and negotiation on the right course , and give a strong indication of the sincerity and commitment of both party . 
point : if , in order to meet with his counterpart , a rogue leader need to compromise on his and his country s position even before he get to the table , this would be a signal of weakness to his opponent at home and those vie for his job . for example , in north korea , which be go through a dynastic transition 1 , the new leader kim jong un be yet to become establish and consolidate his status a dictator . any concession to the sate s designate mortal enemy , the us , might jeopardise the succession . similarly , in iran where ahmadinejad have fall from the grace of the supreme religious leader , the ayatollah 2 , agree to precondition in order to get a meeting with obama would signal to the iranian president s rival that it may be a good moment to attempt to force a change of guard . 
counterpoint : meeting with the leader of the united states can equally bolster a leader s support and strengthen his or her position . after all , the us will always prefer and support a leader that be see a reasonable and willing to compromise rather than a hard liner . hosni mubarak be a prime example of a dictator whose position be strengthen by his good relationship and close tie to the us 1 . therefore , many of these dictator may see it in their interest to agree to precondition , if that will buy them american favour . 
point : preconditions delay engagement and negotiation . sometimes it can take year before the party even start talk to each other . in that time , iran will continue to enrich uranium 1 and north korea will continue to expand it nuclear arsenal 2 . if the us wait for precondition to be agree on and meet , by the time president obama get to talk and negotiate directly with the leader of these state , he will have a much big crisis to deal with . it may have even get to the point where diplomacy can no longer be use effectively . 
counterpoint : if talk don t take place , that doesn t mean no action can be take against rogue regime . diplomatic pressure , third party talk or even sanction can be effective way to deal with state like iran , syria , or north korea . neither of these require the president himself to sit down with these leader .
