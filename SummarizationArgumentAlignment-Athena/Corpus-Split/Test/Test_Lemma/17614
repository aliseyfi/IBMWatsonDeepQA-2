point : the denial of normal legal process do not automatically confer the absence of legal process altogether . though a normal public trial be not possible for security reason , detainees' right be still respect during the internment process . safeguards be build into the internment process so that each case can be consider fairly , with the suspect represent before a proper tribunal and give a right to appeal to a high authority . at guantanamo bay , president g . w . bush introduce military tribunal make up of five u . s . arm force officer and preside over by qualified military judge to handle the legal ambiguity of suspect hold in the facility 1 . the accuse still have the presumption of innocence and proof of guilt have to be beyond that of a reasonable doubt 2 . if such a trial be provide often to standard of evidence and procedure high than in normal court in many country around the world and a sentence properly pass , then this be not internment a it have be practise in the past . 
counterpoint : tribunals do not respect detainee right , but in fact require the undermining of those right . regardless of the procedure with which internment be dress up by embarrassed authority , it be open to abuse because trial be secret with the executive essentially scrutinise itself . often there be not a free choice of lawyer to represent the suspect detainees before us military commissions can only choose lawyer approve by the executive . trials be hold in secret with crucial evidence frequently withhold from the accuse and his defence team , or give anonymously with no opportunity to examine witness properly . appeals be typically to the executive which choose to prosecute them , rather than to an independent judicial body . in such circumstance prejudice and convenience be likely to prevent justice be do . 
point : at a time when our society be under threat , it be more important to protect our intelligence source than it be to try and punish individual terrorist . even when strong proof exists , charge and try terror suspect in open court would require government to reveal their intelligence source . this would risk the identification of their spy in foreign country and within dangerous organisation . not only might this lead to the murder of brave agent , it would also shut off crucial intelligence channel that could warn u of future attack 1 . for example , the head of police in northern ireland have admit if people be not confident their identity would be protect they would not come forward 2 . in a deal with the devil , the intelligence procure be more important and save more life than the violation of one s right to a fair trial . even if special arrangement be make to present intelligence evidence in court , hostile organisation would be able to work out how much or little western intelligence service know about them , and the manner in which they operate . in these circumstance , detention without public trial be the only safe option . 
counterpoint : not only be intelligence often badly flaw , internment simply doesn't work a a strategy to combat terrorism 1 . instead it be counter productive , because it make martyr of the individual and group who be be detain . the experience of northern ireland be that internment act a a recruiting sergeant for the ira , radicalising many detainee without previous terrorist contact , and rally supporter to their cause in response to the perceived injustice . similar response can be see to guantanamo bay today in the muslim world . moreover , the confidence of ordinary citizen in their government be undermine by such harsh measure , reduce their support for the overall war effort . indeed , if we compromise aspect of our free and open society in response to pressure , then the terrorist who hate our value be win . 
point : governments must have power to protect their citizen against threat to the life of the nation . this be not merely to directly protect citizen from political violence , but also because political violence handicap the process of reconstruction 1 in nation building effort . everyone would recognise that rule that be apply in peacetime may not be appropriate during wartime . captured enemy combatant , for example , should not expect to be try individually in civilian court ; it be essential however that they be hold securely until they no longer pose a threat or an appropriate legal process can be establish to assess their case . the war on terror be in this respect a war like early , more conventional conflict whereby capture combatant be hold until the conclusion of conflict . no one capture on d day expect to be grant a trial in a civilian court to establish their guilt . just because our enemy do not wear uniform or conform to a normal military structure some indeed may even hold the citizenship of the state they be fight against , do not make them any less of a threat to our society . 
counterpoint : governments clearly have power to protect citizen from harm , but there be a limit to that extension of power . it be a limit that do not include the undermining of the very value the state be build upon , restrict executive power . captured enemy combatant be not comparable to those capture during world war ii , for the former be arrest for the perceive threat they cause , whilst the latter be capture and intern for a tangible , real threat 1 . soldiers be implicitly guilty when capture , enemy combatant who have yet to commit a crime can reasonably claim their innocence and deserve a fair trial . furthermore , there be little evidence to suggest that internment without trial be a mean to protection ; the period of internment only stir up sentiment that can be direct against the captor once eventually release . it may be the case that the safe way of protect civilian be in fact to offer suspect a fair trial and , if find innocent , render back to where they be find . the existence of a strong , impartial legal framework would have infinite benefit for the moral standing of the state in the eye of potential adversary .
