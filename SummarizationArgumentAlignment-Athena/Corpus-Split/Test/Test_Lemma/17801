point : if this be simply a matter of perform a procedure with no apparent benefit to the patient in most case a young child then it do rather raise the question of why . if the procedure be , say , cut off a toe or an earlobe then all involve would require a clear and compelling case for such a practice . there be grown adult that think that cut off a finger be the next stage up from get a tattoo or a piercing i . at best most people would consider such a practice odd , at bad unstable . however , these be grow adult who have make the decision to mutilate their body for themselves and a a statement they feel appropriate . 
counterpoint : neo natal circumcision be an operation that have be perform , perhaps , more than any other . it be perform mostly for cultural or religious reason but there be also a body of evidence that suggest health benefit . there be very little suggestion in any study of any harm to the child . 
point : a report by the royal dutch medical association note that there be not a single medical body in the world that could point , categorically to a medical need for circumcision of infant . it far conclude that the fact that this practice be not medically necessary and entail a genuine risk of complication mean that extra stringent requirement must be establish with regard to this type of information and advice . yet this be a practice that be perform around the world by people with little or no medical training and accept by parent a an instruction from god . 
counterpoint : there be , of course , risk in any medical procedure . however circumcision remain astonishingly safe . furthermore , deny the parent of a child the right to raise that child in accordance with their own belief would represent an unacceptable intrusion by the state into it citizen private and religious life . 
point : any risk need to be justify against some benefit . in the absence of any demonstrable benefit then there be no need to tolerate any risk , particularly in the case of a newborn baby who cannot express his opinion one way or another and will not be able to do so for year to come . 
counterpoint : the precautionary principle be alive and well but risk be inevitable in any procedure . there be no reliable data on fatality directly relate to circumcision .
