counterpoint : the discussion will not be about gay right or the prevalence of gay people in respected industry , but rather will be able the ethical nature of have out them in the first place . this doesn t give any political weight to movement , it only demonize the people who have out them and allow the opposition to the movement to point to the fact that these gay celebrity want to remain closeted a a reason to believe that it be weird and wrong . 
point : celebrities be uniquely place to help break down misunderstand and prejudice against the gay community . 
counterpoint : although this may be the case for some people in society , you will not reach the most vehement opposition to gay right with this tactic . the people who pose the most threat to the gay right movement be those who have prejudice that be so deeply entrenched either socially or religiously that this will not foster a deep understanding , but rather a rejection of these celebrity a weird and immoral just like all the rest of the gay community 1 . the only people you actually reach with this policy be those who be open to be persuade on the issue a it be , and therefore , you gain no extra benefit from approach the issue this way . 
point : celebrities have a special obligation to society because their success and life be directly create and maintain by society . 
counterpoint : celebrities be in no way more indebted to society than any other person who be dependent on society for everything from their education through to their employment and every single aspect of their life . moreover , this argument be dependent on there be a massive benefit to society , which be disputable . celebrities do not have an obligation to martyr themselves for the cause of any person in society who can demonstrate the potential benefit of their cause .
