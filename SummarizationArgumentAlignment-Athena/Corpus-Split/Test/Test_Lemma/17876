point : nationalism be a sense of fellow feeling between group member . this promote cooperation and social cohesion within the group . nationalism and the identity it bring create a social glue which bind otherwise different people together , that sense of social cooperation make welfare , social security and medical program much more likely and strong . it also may make for a smooth political process when there be a solid basis for consensus . those who be net contributor to the system need something to make them feel that what they be do be worthwhile and in their interest ; something a national identity provide a it create a sense of belong that transcend economic interest . in canada for example those who strongly identify with canada be much more likely to support redistribution and healthcare than those with low identification with canada . 1 societies with a healthy sense of nationalism be more likely to provide for each other and avoid the plight of poverty or poor health . 
counterpoint : far from promote cooperation and social cohesion nationalism a much divide nation a unites them . it be no longer the case that almost everyone in a country will identify themselves the same way a there be increase population movement . moreover very few nation border fit ethnic or linguistic boundary . this mean that nationalism s darker side will have much more of an impact . nationalism cause internal ethnic violence through it narrative of racial superiority . this aspect of nationalism have cause numerous genocide , include but not limited to the holocaust , the armenian genocide , and the ethnic cleansing of the breakup of yugoslavia . this be the inevitable result of nationalism's focus upon definition we be u because we be not like them and so encouragement to exclusion and antagonism . this apply as much to group within the state , where the other be see a both inferior and a a threat , a to other state with different ethnic and cultural tradition . 
point : nationalism have be a potent force for self determination in colonial territory . the profoundly misunderstood vietnamese independence movement , as well a most african liberation movement of the 1940s and 1950s draw heavily on the idea of nationhood to mobilise their people against a foreign exploitative power . other example include india , indonesia , guinea , and guyana . most often these state , once independence have be achieve , see a fracturing of nationalism that prevents those nationalist impulse from be use to condone violence against minority population . meanwhile in big multi ethnic state , most notably india and indonesia nationalism have be use positively to keep the state and it many ethnicity united my make a high level of identity above the regional identity that in many other area of the world would have become a national identity . 1 
counterpoint : while nationalism be a force for self determination this be not always a good thing . the utility of such nationalism depend on at what level the nationalism be create nationalism in india can be say to unite india but tamil nationalism be a national identity at the level below and so be a source of disunity within a country that have already gain self determination . 
point : nationalism can take many benign form , such a that of civic nationalism , where a share sense of national identity be create and reinforce by institution , not ethnicity or history . the start point of civic nationalism be not an ethnic group but the state s territorial border . it focus on citizenship , civic right and legal code where all citizen be equal . 1 civic nationalism have take firm root in the united kingdom and the united states . this be an inclusive kind of nationalism that accept any individual into it institution . nationalism can provide cultural and political glue for strong democratic institution that can win out over form of ethnic exclusion or political repression . 
counterpoint : nationalism be only benign in the sense that it be an improvement on local tribalism the good be derive from the expand size of the group for which individual be willing to work towards the advantage of . by these standard civic nationalism be definitely a step forward and be much less divisive than any ethnically base nationalism but it do not go far enough . the natural conclusion of this reasoning be that the great good would come from u move beyond nationalism and conceive of ourselves a be collective member of the human race , or far , a a part of the ecosystem of the earth . 
point : according to isaiah berlin , the physiognomy of culture be unique : each present a wonderful exfoliation of human potentiality in it own time and place and environment . we be forbidden to make judgment of comparative value , for that be measure the incommensurable . 1 a plurality of nation , especially in the modern era , can allow for cultural development and cultural exchange that benefit both party . the human variety offer by national feeling make the world a good place , through the diversity offer by the culture that nationalism nurture and protects . 
counterpoint : diversity be not always a good thing there be major advantage to there be less diversity if it mean that we can understand each other . better understanding do not just mean less conflict but be also beneficial to the economy a there can be more trade something which nationalism can often block due to worry over other country take job .
