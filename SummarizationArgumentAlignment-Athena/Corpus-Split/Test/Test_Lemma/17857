point : sovereign wealth fund swfs have become very important player in the global economy . the already exceed the asset control by hedge fund and will surpass the stock of global foreign exchange reserve . 1 they be now so big that their activity can shift market , such a norway s government pension fund do when short selling iceland s bank , lead to panic and instability when they sell asset suddenly . 2 their purchase can mean that company own by other state can end up dominate the economy of small country , undermine their own sovereignty and economic independence . it be also worry that many swfs be control by undemocratic state which have a questionable commitment to capitalism ; should we allow such state to exercise so much power over our economy ? 
counterpoint : sovereign wealth fund be not new and they be still only a tiny part of the global financial system . they represent only about 2 of global traded security , and be dwarf by other financial actor such a mutual fund , or private equity group and hedge fund . 1 what be more , in comparison with these other player in the global financial system , swfs be long term investor look many year , even decades into the future . this mean that they be likely to bring calm , rather than irrational volatility to market , a they will not be rush into dump asset base on a few month of bad data . 
point : sovereign wealth fund raise worry issue about national security . unlike mutual fund or private equity group , which seek only to maximise their investor return , swfs must be regard a political entity . rather than passively hold their asset , they may seek to use their purchase to gain access to natural resource , advanced technology , include those crucial to our defence , or other strategic sector . 1 for example gulf state be use their swfs to invest in food and natural resource from latin america . 2 they may engage in economic nationalism , shut factory in western country to give an unfair advantage to their own industry 3 . while it have not yet happen they may even attempt economic blackmail , threaten to turn off the light through their control of energy company and utility if government do not fall in with their foreign policy aim . allowing country such a china , russia and various gulf state to buy up western company at will be potentially very dangerous . even if we regard these state a friendly at the moment , there be no guarantee that they will stay that way , especially a none of them share our political value . 
counterpoint : fears about national security be greatly overblown , and be often simply an attempt to justify protectionist measure . very few company pose a national security risk , and those that do be cover by exist regulation so that , for example , the usa could veto dubai port world s bid to take over american port . most swfs do not seek full control of company they invest in , so they be not in a position to manipulate their asset for political gain , even if they wish to . 1 in reality , country set up swfs for economic reason and they represent a major national investment , the value of which would be expensively destroy if they once try to abuse their position . nor be there any actual example of a country try to exert political influence through it sovereign wealth fund . overall , tie a wide variety of state into the international economic and financial system be beneficial , a it give them a stake in the peace which the global economy need for prosperity and so make them less likely to pursue aggressive foreign policy . conversely , alienate the government of other state by designate them a dangerous predator who cannot be allow to invest in our company be a sure way to create enemy . 
point : sovereign wealth fund suffer from an almost total lack of transparency . most country maintain secrecy about the size of their fund and the extent of their holding , their accountability to government , their investment strategy and their approach to risk management . without know these thing , it be impossible to gauge whether political or economic objective will dominate the swfs behaviour , or indeed whether they will make safe and responsible shareholder in any business secrecy breed corruption . for these reason , jeffrey garten of yale have argue that swfs should be oblige to publish independently audited account twice a year . he have also point out that many country operate swfs protect their domestic economy from foreign competition and investment . we should demand reciprocity , so that country seek investment abroad must open up their own economy fully before they be allow to hold significant asset elsewhere . 1 
counterpoint : transparency be a good thing , but it would be unfair to single out sovereign wealth fund for special punishment over this issue . hedge fund and private equity group be even less transparent than swfs , and their influence in the global economy be much great . 1 some country e . g . norway already operate very transparent investment strategy . many have agree to the santiago principles which encourage transparency and disclosure of financial information . 2 it be likely that other country will come over time to follow their lead voluntarily , a it be in the interest of their own citizen to see that the state be manage their money in an efficiently and honestly . 
point : the ownership of important business by sovereign wealth fund run counter to the economic policy pursue by almost every government over the past 25 year . in the 1970s many state own nationalised industry a part of an attempt at socialist economic planning that have now be discredit . state ownership distort incentive , interfere with management and produce decade of underinvestment , poor service to consumer , and national economic failure with the most extreme example be the soviet union itself . since the 1980s country everywhere have follow the example of thatcher s britain and privatise their industry , free them to compete efficiently and to generate more wealth and job than they have ever do in state hand . going back to state ownership of business be a dangerous backward step , especially a it be now foreign government that be do the nationalising . 
counterpoint : while it may be true that the state be often a bad manager of asset and business in this case the state be not usually involve in the management of the asset . this be be do through the wealth fund which be often in large part run by people whose background be in finance rather than in government . this use of external independent asset manager in itself should be enough to ease worry over state control . 1 because swfs don t seek to have control over the majority of the business they invest in discredited government economic planning be not an issue . 2 indeed swfs be operate much more like private company than state own enterprise . 
point : a number of possible model of regulation have be suggest for sovereign wealth fund . some , such a gilson and milhaupt , have argue that state own investment vehicle that buy share abroad should not be allow vote right in that stock . 1 others would put a cap on swf investment , so that they cannot take a stake of more than , say 20 in any business without government approval within the country the swf be invest in 2 meaning that they can only be passive investor . both these proposal would ensure that they be unable to abuse a dominant position while still allow country to benefit from cross border investment in a globalised economy . at the same time such rule would prevent any broad protectionist backlash so the sovereign wealth funds themselves could welcome the regulation . 
counterpoint : regulations already exist to prevent foreign investment that might compromise national security . 1 other than this it would be unfair to discriminate against certain class of investor . wealth create capitalism relies upon investor seek to maximise the value of their investment . without vote right or the possibility of exercise majority control of a company , swfs would be unable to ensure that manager be work hard on their behalf , allocate resource efficiently and be hold accountable for their decision .
