point : the state must pay compensation for the terrorist attack because they be indirectly responsible for them . it be the state s duty to ensure that it citizen act within the law by provide deterrent , education and by prevent crime through the use of intelligence . even if the terrorist atrocity do not take place within the state , they be most probably plan within the state or initiate by someone who live in the state . this mean that it be within the state s power to have prevent the attack from take place . just a we would expect a state to investigate and track down a drug syndicate , we expect the state to track down terrorist organisation and prevent their activity . 
counterpoint : it be unjust to expect the state to prevent terrorist attack . most of the terror attack be covert operation which be totally outside the purview of the government in the sense that the ruling mechanism have no idea that attack be be plan . why should any government be responsible for act which it hasn't endorse , authorise or have no knowledge of whatsoever ? terrorist organisation be complex and difficult to track down . they spread themselves in a variety of location . the structure of most terrorist organisation be such that individual only communicate with their immediate superior and do not know the identity or whereabouts of any other member of the organisation , make it very difficult to gather intelligence . another reason why it be difficult to track down terrorist be their unwillingness to offer up information . terrorists be in many case willing to die for their cause and so there be very little that we can do to persuade them to give up other member of the organisation or their plan . in short , they work very hard at hide their plan and their member . it be a testament to this fact the us government , with their sophisticated mean of gather intelligence , take year to locate osama bin laden . 
point : if state be expect to pay compensation in this way then they be incentivised to take action against terrorist organisation to prevent incur this massive cost . they be more likely to put resource into investigate lead and to take a hard stance on terrorist activity . this will decrease the prevalence of terrorism or at least make more intelligence available . 
counterpoint : once again , this be unlikely to decrease terrorism because , a we explain , it be so very difficult to track down terrorist . even if the state want to deter terrorism they may not be able to . 
point : compensation can prevent more violence because the victim be less likely to seek revenge if they feel that a they have be recognise a victim b the perpetrator at least someone represent the perpetrator have suffer financially and so some justice have be do c they be more satisfied with the outcome of event because they have receive money . this be less important in scenario such a the london train bombing and 9 11 where there be little chance of victim retaliate but it be important in conflict that have revenge a a common theme . for example , the israel palestine conflict involve a lot of retaliation resemble age old family feud . feuds be often prevent through the payment of blood money , in saudi arabia blood money rate be 100 , 000 riyals to compensate for the death of a muslim man . 1 perhaps we could use similar compensation to prevent some of this retaliation by compensate victim in the case of terrorism victim . 
counterpoint : the arab hebrew conflict , which start a a political and nationalist conflict over compete territorial ambition cannot just be solve by pay some money and sweep everything under the carpet . if this be to be the case , this conflict would have be long over and every crime against humanity also for that matter could be brush aside by pay compensation . both side have a particular aim that they be fight for which do not disappear with compensation . 
point : often when a terrorist attack occur the victim feel anger not only towards the individual perpetrator or the terrorist organisation but towards the entire national , political , cultural or religious group they belong to . an example of this be the flood of anti muslim , anti arab sentiment that arise after the 9 11 attack . 1 this have a lot of negative consequence because it mean that perfectly innocent people will suffer hate crime and ostracization which in turn be likely to turn those people against the victim of the terrorist attack . this kind of disharmony lay the foundation for poor international relation , discrimination and particularly make it difficult for integration to occur such a when a muslim family move to the us . 
counterpoint : this be false . when the state pay compensation they be take responsibility for the crime , a the proposition state in their first argument , and in do so they be associate themselves with the terrorist , not disassociate themselves a prop claim . furthermore , if the state want to condemn terrorism they could simply release a statement do so . this be a frank contradiction with prop first argument . 
point : the time when reparation tend to be suggest be when there be a wound of sort between two group of people that need to be heal in order for there to be closure and reconciliation . an example of this be after the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa when compensation be give to victim of apartheid . 1 we would argue that terrorist attack fit perfectly into this frame because terrorist attack tend to be commit by one group with a particular political , religious or national identity against another group with a different political , religious or national identity . compensation play a role in reconcile these two group . 
counterpoint : an injection of money do not reconcile a family to the death of a loved one . in south africa there be still tension between white and black people and some continue to call for a white tax and land reclaim so there be certainly not closure .
