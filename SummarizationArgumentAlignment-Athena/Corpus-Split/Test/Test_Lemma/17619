point : at present there be a vicious circle whereby woman see no point in stand for politics because it be view a a male dominate institution . positive discrimination be the only way to encourage woman to stand . only if one generation be push towards politics can there be role model for potential future woman mps to follow ; for that reason it need not be a permanent measure , just one that get the ball rolling1 . it have be prove by a study at the university of toronto , canada , that woman need inspirational female role model more than men ; they need it to be demonstrate that it be possible to overcome barrier2 . positive discrimination would provide this evidence and support . this measure would simply allow woman to overcome the institutional sexism in the selection committee of the establish political party , which have for so long prevent a representative number of woman from become candidate , and would encourage other woman to try and emulate that . it's about change stereotype and perception particularly of the concept 'leadership' , which we automatically think of a a male trait1 . this will help achieve true progress in the future . 
counterpoint : a true role model have to be admire . encouraging more woman to stand for election should not be about 'making up numbers' : woman be extremely capable of become elect without help from male party leader . shirley chisholm , in a famous speech on gender equality to congress in washington , u . s . , on 21st may 1969 , air a similar sentiment : woman need no protection that men do not need . what we need be law to protect work people , to guarantee them fair pay , safe work condition , protection against sickness and layoff and provision for dignified , comfortable retirement . men and woman need these thing equally . that one sex need protection more than the other be a male supremacist myth a ridiculous and unworthy of respect a the white supremacist myth that society be try to cure itself of at this time 1 . apportioning a quota of seat for woman or all woman shortlist will be a patronising implication that woman cannot succeed off the back of their own merit , and that men be innately superior . this do not create inspirational role model . 
point : whilst be it possible for men to speak on women's issue , some topic of debate e . g . on family issue or equality in the workplace be still see a less important than economics or foreign policy . creating more female mps would encourage more debate about social policy , and so do more to produce constructive legislation of relevance to real people's life . for example , harriet harman be the first mp to seriously confront the gap in the treatment of woman and other minority in the workplace1 . this be previously see a a 'soft' issue unworthy of parliamentary attention ; she be more in touch with women's and , of course , many men's priority and act upon them . if we want our political system to be in touch with the priority of everyone , we must to act to increase women's representation . 
counterpoint : margaret thatcher in the uk , and madeleine albright and condoleeza rice in the us be high rank female politician who mostly deal in traditionally 'male' topic . not all female politician will represent women's view or need . indeed , sometimes they be bad advocate for woman . for example , nadine dorries propose a bill in parliament for teach abstinence to girl in school , but exclude teaching boy ; this be a clear bias and suggest that boy can get away with be irresponsible . 
point : in a 'representative' democracy it be vital that every part of the population be accurately and proportionately represent . the present lack of female voice in parliament across the world symbolise the continue patriarchal societal bias . women be over half of the population , yet less than 20 of the house of commons be make up of woman . as of 2011 , there be only 72 woman constitute 16 . 6 of all representatives serve in the house of representatives in the us . in order to truly have a representative government , number must be increase to fairly mirror number in society . all woman shortlist and other artificial mean be a quick and effective way of do this . even david cameron , a traditional opponent to positive discrimination for woman , when ask whether a meritocracy be more desirable , say it doesn't work ; we try that for year and the rate of change be too slow . if you just open the door and say 'you're welcome , come in , ' and all they see be a wave of white male face , it's not very welcome 1 . indeed , a recent report by the hansard society2 say that the number of woman in uk parliament could fall unless positive action be taken3 . sarah childs , launch the report , say that unless all party use equality guarantee , such a all woman shortlist , it be most unlikely that they will select woman in vacant seat 3 . compulsion be necessary to begin to achieve parity of representation4 . the labour party use all woman shortlist in the 1990's and many well know female mps be elect this way . positive action be vital for reason of justice and fairness . 
counterpoint : representative democracy be there to represent the interest of every sector of the population , which may be do without mps visibly be strictly representative . to ensure parliament exactly reflect society's demographic makeup be impossible . besides , how can we be sure that by increase number of woman , women's view will be any good represent ? 1 by allow political party to fix these election shortlist , it may prevent constituency from vote for the candidate they feel best represent their view . true , legislation play a role in the formation of attitude but any legislation that seek to restrict a people freedom of choice be an affront to the very pillar of democracy where freedom of choice be a must .
