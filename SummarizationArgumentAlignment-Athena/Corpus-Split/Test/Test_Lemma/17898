point : the only sustainable solution be to divide and then share jerusalem , and the haram temple mount . no final deal will be possible if one side or the other be not willing to embrace this . sharing jerusalem would involve acknowledge and respect each other s claim which would extend to the other problem prevent agreement . 1 
counterpoint : dividing jerusalem would simply turn the city into a war zone , with the battle line be draw wherever the dividing line be draw , a the two mix up and oppose community fight for control over street , holy site and neighbourhood . moreover , it be simply not true that the inhabitant of east jerusalem necessarily want to be the inhabitant of the capitol of a new palestinian state rather than inhabitant of israel . an opinion poll of resident of all 19 arab neighborhood of east jerusalem conduct in 2011 show opposition to a transfer of control to the palestinian authority . 40 say that they would move to israel if their neighbourhood be transfer to the palestinian authority , and 39 believe most of their neighbour s prefer israeli citizenship . on the other hand only 29 would move to a palestinian neighbourhood if theirs remain in israel , and 31 estimate that most of their neighbour prefer palestinian citizenship . 35 prefer israeli citizenship compare to 30 prefer palestinian citizenship , with 30 not know or not answer . residents therefore seem to be satisfy with their current situation of have israeli identity card which entitle them to all the right of israeli citizen except the right to vote in national election . they be also all entitle to citizenship upon request , in which case they may vote in national election . 6 this mean that share jerusalem will not be a simple solution and that the palestinians can come to trust the israeli government and it security service . 
point : the palestinians have a valid a claim to jerusalem a the capitol of their state a the israelis have a claim to jerusalem a the capitol of their state . at the end of 2008 , the population of east jerusalem be 57 muslim palestinian and only 43 jewish , sow a clear and workable palestinian majority in east jerusalem . 10 both side have important religious site in the city . the dome of the rock be integral to islam to the prophet muhammad s night journey to the temple make it islam s third holy place after only mecca and medina . it be equally important for jews to have access to the western wall . 1 
counterpoint : israel have a good historical , moral and demographic claim to an undivided jerusalem a it capitol than the palestinians have a claim to east jerusalem . this be both because israel's historical claim be old , and indeed original , but also because israel do govern all jerusalem , include east jerusalem , both fairly and democratically . moreover , the idea that jerusalem could be be not practical . if all jerusalem become the capital of both israel and palestine , this would create all sort of potential problem . if it be share for example , would a baby bear in a share jerusalem s civic nationality be israeli or palestinian ? and if an act be commit in jerusalem which one nation's government recognises a a crime but the other doesn't , who decide what should be do ? different country share a disputed territory but not divide it be very illogical , even more so if that territory be the capital of both . imagine what would have happen if the uk , france , and the usa decide to share berlin with the ussr instead of divide it ! 
point : the palestinian people since 1967 have demonstrate through resistance to israeli occupation their desire for an independent state of their own . 7 an undivided jerusalem force the palestinians living in east jerusalem to live under the control of a state they do not wish to be a part of , a violation of their right to self determination under international law . the 1993 vienna declaration , which reaffirm the universal declaration of human rights and the un charter and so set the standard in current international law , unequivocally give all people the right to self determination : all people have the right to self determination . owing to this right they freely establish their political status and freely provide their economic , social and cultural development . . . world conference on human rights considers refusal of the right to self determination a a violation of human right and emphasize the necessity of effective realization of this right . 12 because israel capture east jerusalem during the 1967 war , it be consider occupied territory under international law , and it be illegal for israel to annex it . 7 this be why most country do not recognise israeli sovereignty over east jerusalem and in fact keep their diplomatic mission in tel aviv today and do not consider jerusalem the official capital of israel . 15 the fact that arab state initiate the 1967 war do not justify israel respond by annex palestinian territory or hold on to east jerusalem , and so international law support the return of east jerusalem to the palestinians . 8 
counterpoint : the 1947 arab invasion invalidate the international status of jerusalem . the arab non acceptance of resolution 181 and invasion of israel immediately upon it declaration of statehood essentially renege the resolution and the creation of an arab state at the time . 15 furthermore , self determination be not an absolute right . not every territory and region in the world that seek independence have the right to it . this be due in no small part to the fact that such a system would be unworkable . certain criterion must be meet for a territory and people to obtain a legitimate right to self determination , include not compromise the fundamental security or territorial integrity of the original state , which a palestinian east jerusalem would probably do .
