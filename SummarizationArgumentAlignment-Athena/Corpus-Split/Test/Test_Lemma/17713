point : children whose parent smoke in the home be expose to secondhand smoke without any choice ; they can t just leave to avoid the smoky air . many study have find a link between secondhand smoke exposure through living or work with a smoker and an increase risk of heart disease and lung cancer . 1 the universal declaration of human rights state that everyone have the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well be of himself and of his family . 2 because their respiration be hinder and their long term health be threaten , child who be be expose to secondhand smoke against their will be therefore have their human right infringe by their parent , and this properly subject the parent to punishment . 
counterpoint : the right to a standard of live adequate to their health and well be have to do with make sure child have a roof over their head , enough food , and access to medicine not mandate that parent should have to provide a completely sterile home environment . it be far fetch to claim that parent who smoke around their child be ignore their child s human right . for one thing , research on the effect of be expose to secondhand smoke be subject to question , since it rely on questionnaire and human memory . 1 for another , there be allege health risk from such simple thing a living near a road 2 or eat a relatively unhealthy diet 3 , and we do not say that a parent be be immoral if they choose to raise their child in a house that have a road nearby , or let their child periodically eat unhealthy food . 
point : studies have find that child with parent who smoke be much more likely to use drug , and especially more likely to smoke cigarette themselves . 1 children learn about the danger of smoking and drug in school , and know that it can damage health , but their parent be the most influential figure in their life . if they see their parent , supposedly responsible adult , constantly do something , then they be bind to think that it be okay for them to do it too . having a parent who smoke normalises smoke for the child , which be wrong . in order to prevent this from happen , it be necessary to make sure that parent do not smoke in front of their child by punish them if they do . 
counterpoint : this same logic would call for punishment of other bad adult behaviour , such a drinking , gambling or even poor eating or exercise habit , when perform in front of child . in addition , the cause and effect of parental model on their child s smoke decision be doubtful . many different factor contribute to the likelihood with which a person will choose to start smoking . children may be influence more by peer and sibling than by their parent 1 if so , prevent parent from smoke in front of their child would probably not significantly impact the percentage of child who become smoker . people be more likely to smoke if , for example , they live in a poor area , 2 and if the family live in a poor area the child will be subject to numerous pro smoking influence that persist in economically disadvantage area . besides , child would likely still be aware that their parent smoke , a the parent would have to excuse themselves every time they want a cigarette and go somewhere specifically to smoke . 
point : not be able to smoke in their home without risk punishment will make it much more difficult for parent to continue smoking , encourage them to smoke much less or even give up altogether , which will improve their health . this can be see in report which show that there be a big decrease in the number of smoker in england after the ban on smoke in public place there , 1 presumably because they didn t want to have to go outside all the time and be away from their friend every time they want to have a cigarette . similarly , many parent will give up smoke to avoid have to leave their child every time they want to have a cigarette or risk be punish . 
counterpoint : tobacco be legal . smoking be legal . the state encroaches on basic freedom when it punish legal conduct for ulterior motif . would the same logic justify punish parent who drink alcohol in front of their child , because the inconvenience might reduce drink among parent ? also , the desired indirect effect of punish parent who smoke in front of their child may not be achieve . other study in england have show that while the number of smoker try to quit do increase shortly after the ban on smoke in public place be introduce there , number steady again soon after that . 1 while the ban might have lead to some people quit at the beginning , many others continue to smoke despite the new law , obviously just find somewhere else to do it . this show that most smoker will just find a different way to continue their habit . this could have detrimental effect in the case of punish parent who smoke around their child , since those parent might leave their child alone in the house while they go somewhere else to smoke , which be potentially dangerous . instead of risk a scenario where child be periodically left alone during parental smoke break , parent should just be trust to live their life responsibly . it be unnecessary to bring in a legislation that would just inconvenience so many people . 
point : given the high compliance rate of the ban on smoke in public place in country like scotland , 1 it be reasonable to predict that people will be just a law abide with a law that protect child from secondhand smoke in their home . part of the effect would deter parental smoking . they may not want to break the law and realize that it be a serious enough issue for child s health that they should stop . furthermore , friend , relative and others who care about the health and well be of child could be trust to ensure that those flout the new law would be highlight to police . other mean of make enforcement workable would be to prohibit smoking in vehicle with child under age 14 , violation observe by traffic police could be handle like other vehicle relate infraction . 2 after provide ample advance notice of the new law s start date , fine for violation in the home could be enforce , with each repeat violation receive an increase fine . 
counterpoint : given the existence of group campaign against ban on smoke in public place e . g . , forest , it seem fair to say that this proposition would not be instantly accept by all . punishing parent for smoke around their child would be a much more invasive process than punish people for smoke in pub and restaurant , and people would be much less happy with it . as such , they be more likely to flout the law and do so in private , ensure that the police will never be able to charge them with a violation of the new law .
