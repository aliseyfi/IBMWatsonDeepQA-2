point : global institution be well equip to comparatively analyze the fact about fgm and therefore need to prohibit the practice of fgm so that those ignorant to the consequence of the practice will be protect . global organization be also the only body that can ensure that marriage network give up the practice simultaneously so that no woman be socially handicap . this process prove successful in china in the early 20th century when the practice of foot binding be rapidly abandoned1 . it require sufficient funding for large scale education effort and adequate enforcement , a financial requirement that only these large organization can meet2 . 
counterpoint : making this a blanket policy come from international organization , and human right treaty , will likely only create backlash against the invasion of western culture . this have be see in the past , where for example , in the sudan the british and egyptians force the practice to be end in the 1970s , which only force it to happen in secret , girl be cut at an early age , and they be not take to medical professional if complication arise 1 . if there be a backlash , then a global ban come from international organization for whom this project be also too specialized , and highly culturally sensitive will fail completely . 
point : while many believe that fgm be associate with the tenet of a religion , this be in fact not the case . different religious leader condone , deem it irrelevant , or discourage it , but there be no one religion that explicitly say fgm be a necessary practice 1 . therefore , ban fgm be not declare a religion wrong and do not debunk the fundamental belief of a group of people . instead , it be compete with a cultural practice that show a woman s purity , consider to be harmful to her . cultures change and adapt a they come into modernity foot binding be no longer practice in china , although it be a deep seeded tradition . however , as long a it remain culturally value for woman to be cut and men only want to marry cut woman the practice will continue 2 . therefore , there need to be a total ban on the practice so that all woman be uncut otherwise , not undergo the procedure will continue to carry stigma in some society . the practice have be replace within some group , with one that celebrate and serve the same purpose , but do not involve cut 3 . fgm be not a necessary part of religion and the fundamental belief of the group that practice it . so , it be not insensitive to ban it . and , a ban be the only way to make be uncut the norm within these culture . 
counterpoint : whether it be tie to religion , do not justify call a cultural tradition wrong . conservative jews believe that piercings , tattoo , and any other form of change the body be wrong , yet it be accept that they have the right to believe what they do . the most important factor be choice people be allow to choose what they do with their body and what they believe . telling them this be wrong be not appropriate . this apply to genital cutting as well . telling group of people who have historically practice cut that this be inherently bad be not sensitive or justified . education and safe practice should instead be promote so that people can make educated decision . 
point : some right be inalienable , guarantee to all human being and cannot be violate with any justification . the right to bodily integrity be perhaps the most fundamental right we enjoy a civilized human beings1 . fgm be a form of illegal body modification and the mutilation of those too young to give their informed consent . most be not give the choice a they would be socially marginalize if they be 'uncut' . genital mutilation may leave a lasting mark on the life and mind of the woman who have undergone it . in the long term , woman may suffer feeling of incompleteness , anxiety and depression . fgm be also a form of violence against woman and a direct expression of patriarchal oppression . fgm have be practice by some culture solely in order to maintain the chastity and virginity of a woman before marriage , to ensure fidelity during marriage , and to increase male sexual pleasure2 . fgm additionally violate her right to equal opportunity , to not be discriminate against , to freedom from violence , injury , abuse , torture , cruel or inhuman treatment , protection from harmful traditional practice and the freedom to make reproductive decision , all of which be protect under international law3 . it take a woman's body out of her own control , and ultimately inflicts long term pain and suffering , none of which can be justify . 
counterpoint : as a human right a woman have a right to control her own body and make her own choice . this only promote the need for increased education and choice in regard to genital cutting , versus a total ban . if woman choose that they would like to undergo the practice , then they should be allow to , consider that deny them this option be also violate their right to free choice and bodily expression . fgm be primarily continue by woman and often against the wish of a grow majority of men , so it cannot simply be see a patriarchal oppression 1 . 
point : immediate complication of female genital mutilation include severe pain , shock , hemorrhage , urine retention , ulceration of the genital region and injury to adjacent tissue1 . hemorrhaging and infection can cause death . long term consequence include cyst and abscess , keloid scar formation , damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence , dyspareunia painful sexual intercourse and sexual dysfunction , as well a difficulty with childbirth2 . more recently , concern have arise about possible transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv due to the use of a single instrument in multiple operations3 . the fundamental goal of human society be preservation , and it be the responsibility of world wide organization to safeguard human sustainability . this goal be compromise in culture that practice fgm . deliveries to woman who have undergo fgm be significantly more likely to be complicate by caesarean section , postpartum hemorrhage , and episiotomy , extend maternal hospital stay , resuscitation of the infant , and inpatient prenatal death , than delivery to woman who have not have fgm . it be estimate in a june 2006 who study that 10 to 20 baby per thousand birth die during delivery a a result of the practice of fgm4 . additionally 25 30 of woman who undergo fgm be leave infertile5 . fgm jeopardize maternal and infant health and therefore cannot be justify . the health consequence that it cause mean it should not be allow to continue . 
counterpoint : since genital cutting be culturally important , especially to preserve the idea of a woman's purity , virginity , and therefore her ability to get marry , a ban on genital mutilation would only cause the practice to go underground1 . making the practice safe and regulate would well solve the health problem associate with it , versus ban it all together .
