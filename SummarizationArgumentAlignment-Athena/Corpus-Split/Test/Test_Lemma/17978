point : the market have no interest in alter a model in which scarcity increase profitability a be the case with the current market . within that context there be little likelihood that they will provide , with no stimulus , the front load investment necessary for the development of new technology . instead the state have the capacity to offer both the carrot of guarantee a future market and the stick of regulate future carbon emission . 
counterpoint : the market will , ultimately , respond to cost . as a result , just a have be the case with tar sand and shale fracking and other non traditional source of carbon fuel once the cost justifies it or the demand be create then the market will respond by create or utilize new innovation . 
point : in the process of create , effectively an entire new industry , there be myriad infrastructural consideration which company be poorly place to deliver . companies rely on government to train graduate and other staff , to plan for and deal with the externality of industry and , perversely , to regulate them . the energy industry , in particular have not demonstrate a notable capacity to undertake any of these task voluntarily and there be little reason to believe that they would act any differently in the future . 
counterpoint : it be in the interest of the provider of infrastructural service such a education to respond to the change face of the market . attempting to predict that in advance be almost always reckless a have be routinely see in the relationship between university , plan body and others in relation to the it industry . 
point : governmental and inter governmental policy can be focus on decade in the future rather than on the next product launch . energy policy in particular operates on long time scale due to the very long build time for new power plant . equally , government have the power to regulate and , where necessary , compel individual and organization to comply with those regulation . moreover government s interest be very different from the interest of business ; government s interest be in the future welfare of their citizen not their own profit and be as much for the young a the current working generation . 
counterpoint : energy efficiency be an important part of any plan not only for it environmental benefit but also because of it impact on the balance sheet . this reality be be discover not only by individual and smes but by global corporation who be , increasingly build into their corporate strategy i . while it may be true that energy company want everyone to use more energy for most company the opposite be true . the market ensure that company want to cut their cost and so reduce energy consumption . at the same time company know that consumer too want to reduce their energy consumption so a to cut cost so make their product a energy efficient a possible
