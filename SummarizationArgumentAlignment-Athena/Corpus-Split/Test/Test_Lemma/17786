point : professional cheerleader cause men to think of woman a object . they exist on the sideline , wear short skirt and look pretty , whilst the male sport player be the hero . this affect the way that men view woman more generally . it make them think that woman be less important than men . even where professional cheerleading squad contain men , this view of woman be reinforce : male cheerleader lift woman and throw them around a if they be object and only there for decoration . 
counterpoint : the cheerleader have a clear role to support the sport team and therefore it be their talent be showcased . if this be an example of woman be objectify , then there be clearly much more important example to focus on ; ban professional cheerleading would achieve nothing . 
point : professional cheerleader affect how people view woman in general , and therefore there be harm to society . although freedom of choice be often important , it be inhibit at the point that one person start to harm others or society . as this happen in this case , cheerlead should be ban . 
counterpoint : professional cheerleader do not harm society ; on the contrary , by make sport more exciting and engage , they encourage an interest in sport , which be good for society because of the health and community benefit . community benefit be see in the reporting of local high school game in local newspaper . it be a focus of interest for the community , bring people together . however , this interest in sport first stem from the enjoyment of sport on a large scale in professional tournament . 
point : professional cheerleader be bad role model for woman , and especially for teenager who take part in cheerleading . they tend to wear short skirt and show more of their skin than college and high school cheerleader . in addition , their routine tend to be more obviously sexual , and less focus on gymnastic stunt . 
counterpoint : in many sport , woman wear clothes that be tight or short ; this be because the sport require agility , and excess clothing would impede their ability . for example , gymnast wear tight leotard and tennis player wear short skirt or short . there be plenty of gymnastic stunt in cheerleading , and to suggest that they tend to be sexual be a misrepresentation of the truth . 
point : a large number of woman and teenage girl suffer from eat disorder . 1 part of the desire to be thin come from the constant parade of perfect woman . professional cheerleader often have much of their body on show , and a men cheer them and comment on their look , the message to woman be reinforce : it be important to fit a specific version of beauty . 
counterpoint : models , celebrity and magazine all emphasise look and figure . if cheerleader be thin , then they be not the bad offender , and in fact , be positive in the way that they show that a good figure come from exercise rather than dangerous diet . 
point : women be very talented at sport , a demonstrate by venus and serena williams in tennis , paula radcliff in athletics or nastia liukin in gymnastics . however , when people see cheerleader they be more likely to view woman s role in sport a one confine to look pretty on the sideline . women s sport already receive a lot less coverage than men s sport , and it be important to promote the success that woman achieve . professional cheerleader detract from this . this be further true consider that many of the woman participate in professional cheerleading would no doubt be very talented at other athletic pursuit . 
counterpoint : there be no reason why professional cheerleader cannot be respect for the athletic talent that cheerlead require . if we want woman s sport to be more respected , it might be necessary to spend more money promote game or force the medium to cover a large number of female sport event , rather than focus on men . however , professional cheerleader do not stop any of these sport from be treat seriously . 
point : professional cheerleader discourage lot of woman , religious people and family from attend professional sport game . many people do not want to watch woman dance on the pitch wear skimpy clothes , so do not attend . similarly , they do not bring their child because they think that it be inappropriate . professional sport game be a great way to bring people together to form a community . it also encourage child to take part in sport themselves , improve their health . professional cheerleader be harmful because they discourage such attendance . 1 
counterpoint : sports team pay cheerleader to support them . if this didn t have a positive effect on attendance , they would not do so . this show that the number of conservative parent be vastly outweigh by other viewer who do not mind . 
point : cheerleading be a highly strenuous sport . it combine gymnastics with dance . it be also high impact , very energetic and require sophisticated synchronized move . not only do college team and high school team cheer their sport team , but they also perform at competition . 
counterpoint : conversely , have professional team give young cheerleader something to aspire to . many college cheerleader go on to win place on professional squad and that be a high accolade for many . professionals may not go to competition , but that do not mean they do not have an opportunity to demonstrate their athletic prowess . in fact , without the stress of competitive cheerleading , professional squad have more freedom to experiment with new idea and technique , which competitive squad do not have time for . this mean professional squad can potentially showcase even great talent than competitive squad .
