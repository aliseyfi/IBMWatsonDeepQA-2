point : the freedom of sexual expression and exploration be not only a matter of choice which be fundamental to the individual it be also particularly important to young people a they proceed through the stage of adolescence into young adulthood . age of consent law place artificial limit on this freedom . sex be entirely natural and should be celebrate in the context of love relationship , not criminalise and put under the pry eye of an authoritarian state . violence , coercion and exploitation in sexual relationship should still be punish , but not consensual activity . such restriction go against the human right to privacy and of freedom of expression . 
counterpoint : those who be underage be not 'expressing' themselves through sex . they be unlikely to fully know what they be do so this be not an area where they be go to be express themselves . children have freedom of expression in many other area and through technology gain more and more option . this be therefore a step that be unnecessary if all it be about be 'freedom of expression' . 
point : some country have one age of consent for young female say 16 and a different , high age of consent for young male or for have anal sex say 18 . this mean that a heterosexual adult male who want to have sex with a 17 year old female be free to do so , but a homosexual adult male cannot have intercourse with a young man who be 17 . 1 not only be such law clearly discriminatory , they entrench and perpetuate the myth , stereotype , and prejudice against homosexual and homosexual sex . age of consent law , if we be to have them at all , should be equalise across the gender . 
counterpoint : the principle reason some country have high age of consent for male compare to female 1 be simply because of the medical evidence that male reach sexual maturity at a later age than female . 2 this have nothing to do with discriminate against homosexual sex . however it be true that when it come to child , some country do view underage homosexual a slightly more dangerous than underage heterosexual sex . largely because there be the high risk of hiv infection in the case of the former . 3 
point : the idea that young people should not be have sex be a leftover relic from the past : it justification be anachronistic and have little place in modern time . age of consent law be the product of a purity campaign in britain in the 1800s , when it be believe that sex be a male privilege , that it lead to the sexual ruin of young woman , that it mean the loss of their virtue , which be a fate bad than death , and that it contribute to woman s second class citizenship . 1 in the uk the age of 16 be choose and set in 1885 , more than 100 year ago , and have remain ever since . 2 today these idea would offend both men and woman . 
counterpoint : liberals tend to assume that many young boy and girl would want to have sex if not for age of consent law . in reality many boy and girl themselves actually do not want to have sex or sexual contact , but lack the social and emotional confidence to say no . age of consent law protect such child , by prevent others from put them in such a difficult position and help them against peer pressure . 
point : age of consent law be in fact dangerous because they drive underground the very people who should be , and be in most need of , receive contraceptive , advice on safe sex , and access to health and other educational service . this be true both of the statutory rapist as well a the under 16 consent victim , who may worry about have assist in the commission of a crime . both party then become real victim a they be put at great risk of contract stds or unwanted pregnancy . 
counterpoint : it seem important to note that the age of consent could be maintain or raise while allow people who need advice on or access to contraceptive , or other service to access them . the idea would be that school student be still teach about sex , contraceptive and consequence , and doctor be to give free , impartial and most importantly confidential advice , and contraception to be readily available to all .
