point : ever since the destruction of the japanese city of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 during the closing day of world war ii , the threat of global devastation through nuclear world war have hang over human civilization like a damocles sword . the threat of global nuclear destruction peak during the most perilous year of the cold war during the 1950s through the 1970s , and it gradually subside thereafter . with the collapse of the soviet union in the early 1990s , many people come to believe that the threat have entirely disappear . but this be false complacency . although national arsenal of nuclear tip icbms have decline in the two decade since the end of the cold war , they still exist at level that would cause unimaginable death and destruction be they unleash in a world war . the history of human civilization throughout the age demonstrate the strong propensity among human being toward hostility , violence and warfare whatever the potential cost . as long a the international political system be base upon the sovereignty of nation state , the threat of nuclear world war will always be there . 
counterpoint : a world government be not need to prevent nuclear world war , because such a war would be so catastrophic that the common sense of humanity will prevent it from ever happen . from the early day of the nuclear arm race , and especially after intercontinental ballistic missile be perfect in the 1960s a the principal mean of delivery of nuclear bomb , a delivery system for which no plausible defense could be devise , it be recognize that all out world war be no long a viable option in the contemporary world , simply because such a war would almost inevitably entail mutual assured destruction mad . not only would the immediate death and destruction be overwhelming , but the long term effect from radiation and possible nuclear winter could be even bad . in the mad world , the population of all nation , especially those of the major power , be hold hostage in a sort of perpetual mexican standoff . as paradoxical a it may seem , the development of nuclear weapon and ballistic delivery system have create the most effective deterrent to unrestricted warfare ever see in the history of the human race . the inescapable horror of a nuclear war guarantee that such a war will never happen . 
point : economic interaction among the nation of the world , in the form of trade , investment and migration , have reach such a point today that it be meaningful to think of the world economy . economic globalization suggest the need for political globalization in the form of a world government . following the seminal work of john maynard keynes during the great depression of the 1930s , it have become widely accept within the economics profession that a certain amount of interventionist national government policy be essential to maintain a proper balance between the twin economic evil of unemployment and inflation . just a judicious national anticyclical policy be beneficial to national economy , so too a judicious world anticyclical policy , a implement by a functioning world government , would be beneficial to the world economy . a world government would also improve the overall functioning of the global economy by mean of regularize various circumstance of international economic interaction for example , in the area of patent and copyright , and by work to reduce various trade impediment such a tariff and quota impose by national government . 
counterpoint : just a a high degree of reliance upon free economic market be instrumental to the grow prosperity in the modern era of the first world nation , so too a free economic market at the international level would tend to enhance the growth and development of a strong world economy . as for national government anti cyclical policy , although it be clearly justify in crisis condition of deep depression or hyperinfla tion , too often in the past it have be apply injudiciously , so that it aggravate rather than ameliorates cyclical swing . owing to the various lag in policy determination and implementation describe by the famous economist milton friedman , often expansionary policy take full effect in boom period , while contractionary policy take full effect in recession period . this problem might well hold at the global level if there be a world government in existence attempt to apply world anticyclical policy . to the extent that the world government venture beyond anticyclical policy into the realm of overall regulation and control of the business economy , it be likely to repeat and amplify the self evident error and excesses the national government have make in this area . 
point : a world government would enhance the probability that effective mean will be develop and implement toward ameliorate the global problem of resource depletion and environmental decay . in a world divide into a host of jealously independent and self righteously sovereign nation , national leader tend to point the finger of blame for these problem at other nation , and to resist international effort toward resource conservation and environmental preservation . as the mutual accusation and recrimination go on and on , the problem be leave to fester . if a world government exist , it might muster sufficient respect and posse sufficient authority to enable the nation to arrive at a workable consensus on how to share equitably the short term cost and inconvenience necessary to secure long term sustainability of resource and preservation of environmental quality . 
counterpoint : although the problem of resource depletion and environmental deterioration be indeed serious global problem , it be unreasonably optimistic and idealistic to believe that a world government , in and of itself , would be an effective instrument toward the reduction of these problem . the world government would likely promulgate resource use and environmental protection policy that would be acceptable to some country , but totally unacceptable to other country . another consideration be that in a fundamental sense , resource depletion and environmental deterioration be cause by rapid population growth . a world government might try to control population growth by such draconic mean a the notorious one child policy in the people s republic of china . this would be totally unacceptable to a very large majority of the contemporary human population . 
point : a world government would give people a high focus for their political loyalty than their respective nation state , and thus facilitate the development of a high degree of cosmopolitanism than be possible under the sovereign nation state system . this would benefit the practical operation and effectiveness of the world government . the great the sense of community among the citizen of a polity , the high the effectiveness of the polity s government , and the high the effectiveness of the polity s government , the great the sense of community among it citizen . this suggest an interactive , snowball relationship over time between the sense of community of the citizen of the world federation , and the efficiency and effectiveness of it practical operation . from relatively low sense of community and low effectiveness in it early stage , over many year of gradual evolution , the world federation would eventually achieve a very high level of community spirit and practical effectiveness . 
counterpoint : international relation specialist have long conclude that for a successful political amalgamation to take place , the people of the various regional component of that amalgamation must have a great deal in common . the history of nation state demonstrate , for example , that a common language be a strong unifying force . but there must be other strong commonality aside from language . there cannot be extreme difference in economic condition among the region , or extreme difference in political belief and ideology , or extreme difference in cultural attitude and social more . when we look at the world of nation today , we cannot avoid acknowledge the existence of extreme difference in all of these area . aside from economics and political ideology , the most obvious factor be the multiplicity of language and religion . we be force to conclude that a successful political amalgamation among such a wide assortment of dramatically diverse nation be virtually impossible . 
point : the history of the european union eu in the post world war ii era provide an encouraging example of what might be do at the global level through a functioning world government . it be widely agree among economist that the relatively high degree of prosperity and security enjoy today by the people of the western european nation be in no small measure the result of the gradual evolution from the original limited purpose , six member european coal and steel community ecsc to the general purpose , 27 member eu of today . in the early 1940s , many of the eu nation of today be lock in devastate warfare . the fact that these same nation be today harmonious component of a quasi state polity demonstrate the capability of people to change their customary mode of thought and behavior when there exist a sufficient incentive to do so . 
counterpoint : the basic flaw in this argument be that throughout modern history . western europe have always be far more homogeneous , in term of economics and culture , than the world a a whole be at the present time . the immense human and material loss of world war i and world war ii create a far more intense motivation in the post war era toward change than exists at the present time over all the nation of the world , since most nation today have not experience the horror of war at first hand for a very long time . moreover , in the aftermath of world war ii , the western european nation be motivate to a high level of harmony and mutual cooperation owe to the fear that if they do not cooperate , they would become mere pawn in the strategic and potentially deadly game be play between the united states and the soviet union .
