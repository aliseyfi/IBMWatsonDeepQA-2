point : wars be just if the cause be just . nations should be allow to defend themselves from aggression , just a individual be permit to defend themselves against violence . in the un charter , sign in the wake of world war ii , article 2 , paragraph 4 altogether prohibit the use or threat of force with only self defence , a state in article 51 , permit a a justification to the resort to arm . 1 
counterpoint : just cause be an elastic concept . who determine what be aggression ? could violate a disputed border region e . g . ethopia eritrea , pakistan india or impose economic sanction e . g on north korea be aggression ? and if a state be unable to defend itself , can another state intervene militarily on it behalf ? these borderline case make invoke this criterion very problematic . 
point : the intention behind the war must be good . states have the right to use war to restore a just peace , to help the innocent , or to right a wrong . for example , the us and nato be justify in use force in bosnia and kosovo . waging war be far more ethical than stand by and permit genocide and ethnic cleansing . 
counterpoint : reality be a lot murky than theory . how be we to determine a state s intent ? sometimes good intention be bind up with bad ; public justification for war may not always represent the real reason . and who be determine if a peace be just or a wrong have be commit ? the nation initiate the war will use it own value to justify it intention , and these value may be at odds with those of the other party to the conflict . furthermore , it be altogether possible to fight a war for selfish motif and nevertheless protect civilian and reduce suffering in so do . 
point : the war must be lawfully declare by a lawful authority . this prevent inappropriate , terrorist style chaos , and ensure that other rule of war will be observe . for example , when state declare war , they generally follow specific legislative procedure ; a guaranteed respect for such procedure be likely to ensure that the nation will respect international humanitarian law , formally codify in the geneva conventions of 1949 and update in the additional protocols of 1977 . 
counterpoint : many nation wage war without official declaration e . g . the usa s involvement in vietnam and act unilaterally instead . such unilateralism do not necessarily lead to an inevitable circumvention of the geneva conventions , it merely avoid the bureaucracy necessary to draw authoritative approval . moreover , who be to decide which entity can and cannot issue call to arm ? legitimate authority have sanction some of the most horrific war in history . 
point : war must be a last resort . the state be justify in use arm force only after it have try all non violent alternative . sometimes peaceful measure diplomacy , economic sanction , international pressure , or condemnation from other nation simply do not work , but they must at least be try in order to give every chance for a peaceful resolution to a crisis . 
counterpoint : sometimes go to war before all alternative be exhaust be the most moral action . for example , a nation might decide to go to war if it determine that wait would enable to the enemy to increase it strength and to do much more damage than an early war would have inflict . this , after all , be the bitter lesson of the failure of appeasement in the 1930s . waiting might allow an invading state to entrench itself so that far great force would be necessary to remove it at a late date . 
point : the goal of the war should be proportional to the offense , and the benefit proportional to the cost . for example , when an attacker violate a nation s border , a proportionate response might extend to restore the border , not sack the attacker capital . a war must prevent more suffering than it cause . the coalition that form under the aegis of the united nations to repel the iraqi invasion of kuwait fight a proportional conflict to the extent that they do not march on baghdad after they have push the iraqi army out of the occupied territory . 
counterpoint : we have see that a proportional response frequently doesn t work . suicide bomber continue to blow up victim in the middle east despite the response . why should a nation tolerate continue aggression for the sake of proportionality ? and if a nation know it be likely to be attack , why should it wait to disarm the aggressor ? is not pre emptive action justify to prevent the loss of innocent life ? finally , what of deterrence : a vigorous response to an aggressive act may not be strictly proportionate , but by make all potential aggressor think twice about future action , it can be justify a save more suffering in the long run . 
point : the war must have a reasonable chance of success . war always involve a loss of life , but expend life with no possibility of achieve a goal be unacceptable . thus , if a fight force cannot achieve it goal , however just , it should not proceed . charging an enemy s cannon on horseback or throw troop at a pointless occupation be clearly not just action . 
counterpoint : sometimes it be morally imperative to fight against overwhelm odds , a resistance fighter do in world war ii . also this condition may give large nation free rein to bully small one because they could not win a war . it also may cause a country to surrender in a war it might actually win . weak country have win war against powerful one look at the american revolution . finally , the point at which a war become unwinnable , and therefore unjust by this definition , be often only identifiable with hindsight consider the soviet occupation of afghanistan , or the american involvement in vietnam .
