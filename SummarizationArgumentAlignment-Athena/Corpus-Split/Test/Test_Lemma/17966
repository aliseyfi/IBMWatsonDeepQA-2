point : as most primary only serve to decide the number of delegate who will be bind to vote for a particular candidate at a party s national convention , a presidential hopeful will be able to ignore contest later in the election cycle if he have already secure a majority of delegate . the staggered nature of primary under the status quo allow candidate to determine when their lead have become unassailable . as a consequence , candidate will refrain from mount campaign in state that poll later in the election cycle . the later a state vote , the less chance it have of influence the size of a candidate s majority . 
counterpoint : the primary be simply the device by which party select their candidate . they be part of the internal affair of america s independent political organisation and do not require the legitimacy of the election itself . 
point : the minority population of both of the early state be relatively low , and this can impact on the outcome of their primary . minority population such a african and latino americans and migrant who have be grant citizenship will approach the issue at the heart of a presidential campaign from a different perspective . due to high level of social and financial deprivation among minority population throughout the us , african americans be likely to vote in a way that reflect concern about law and policy that regulate access to educational subsidy and state support health care . latino voter may have strong familial tie with south american nation state . correspondingly , candidate position on cross border trade and the enforcement of immigration law be likely to influence the voting decision of latino americans i . 
counterpoint : a national primary would disenfranchise large portion of the country , a candidate would be force to court the support of only the most populous state a they currently do in the general election . at least with the primary system a it stand , candidate have to pay attention to all of the state and all section within the party . 
point : immense pressure be place on candidate to win in the early primary and then to deliver repeat performance across key state . each stage of the process be effectively a national campaign and have to be treat and fund a such . even though vote in primary be limit to the citizen of individual state , or the member of state party , the medium can communicate a poor showing in the poll or a blunder in a debate to the entire nation . the overall cost of run campaign advert , research a candidate s position on a huge range of local issue and organise rally , debate and press briefing can quickly become astronomical hence the need to establish a decisive lead as early a possible . 
counterpoint : a lengthy primary campaign give candidate time to test each other on a whole range of issue . voters , in turn , make their decision base on a balance of candidate strength and weakness . voters can do this because they have have the time to get to know the candidate well , to become familiar with their policy and position on various issue and to analyse their professional or political background .
