point : in a democratic society the people be the ultimate arbiter of government policy and action . we be free to remove and replace all level of government on a regular basis . 
counterpoint : the idea that government be at the control of the people might be fine for a civics class , in practice it be really not . the elected component of the government be relatively small and in term of those point at which government enters into most people s live on a daily basis , it be not know for it obedience to the will of the people . 
point : the idea that free market make for free people become derisible the moment you look outside the west . in the developing world unfettered corporation routinely act again the interest and wish of the people . from the privatisation of natural resource in latin america and africa to undermine the price charge by indigenous farmer the world over . even russia , the poster child of the reagan revolution be now control jointly by a dictator and a handful of oligarch .

point : although there be area of government that we , the people , accept must be keep secret such a security , the vast bulk of government activity be open to scrutiny . where it be not we and our elect representative have the tool to find out why . the united states for example have the freedom of information act . i corporations , by their nature , have to be secretive , they have an interest in their customer and competitor not know how they have , or plan to have , a market advantage . they tend not to want their customer to know how much of a product or service s price be profit and so forth . 
counterpoint : this be simply not true . anyone who have ever try to get concrete and meaningful information out of a government agency know that this be untrue . even in many western democracy there be no guarantee of transparency in government , in france former president mitterrand be able to keep it secret that he have cancer . i
