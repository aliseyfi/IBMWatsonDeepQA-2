point : once people leave compulsory education the relationship they have with the state change dramatically . the state no longer have so great a duty of care . their option , other than go to university , would normally be to get a job . in do so they be in an open competition . it seem unreasonable that university should not treat them in the same way a a company would . universities , like company , should therefore have to compete for the best academic talent and there should be a level playing field in this competition rather than set quota or give a leg up for student whether it be for the poor or for those native to the country where the university be locate . 
counterpoint : the state have invest in the individual student and in the university a an institution , it be therefore a stakeholder . a university be , therefore in a significantly different position to a private company which be a more obviously independent actor . 
point : if university be expect to become increasingly self funding in the case of many nation they already be entirely self fund it be unfair to restrict whatever advantage they may have to succeed . equally those university in a country which simply aren t up to scratch should not be guarantee the luxury of an inbuilt base of domestic student . 
counterpoint : this be simply unfair to nation with less developed tertiary sector who would lose all of the little advantage they currently have . even accept the analogy with a market place , the result would work poorly for education just a they have for many involve in free market in other sector . the reality of a free market be not that it improve standard across the board but , rather , that it produce a handful of global leader usually those who have all of the advantage to start with and the rest of them go to the wall . i 
point : the predominant role of tertiary education be skilling people for the workplace . this be do either through direct vocational training or the somewhat more pedagogical shaping of the mind . universities also provide the setting for acquire skill of socialization that allow people to function a independent citizen outside the family home . 
counterpoint : the vast majority of graduate will find their work in their country of birth . in a survey of international student in u . s . university only 6 percent of indian student , 10 percent of chinese student and 15 percent of european student say they want to remain permanently in the u . s . i to design the entire education system to the benefit of these people who will not end up benefit the economy be perverse .
