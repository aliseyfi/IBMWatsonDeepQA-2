point : museums preserve and display our artistic , social , scientific and political heritage . everyone should have access to such important cultural resource a part of active citizenship , and because of the educational opportunity they offer to people of every age . glenn lowry , director of the museum of modern art , claim it s almost a moral duty that museum should be free smith , 2006 . if museum be not fund sufficiently by the government , they will be force to charge for entry , and this will inevitably deter many potential visitor , especially the poor and those whose educational and cultural opportunity have already be limit . visitors to the victoria and albert museum in london decline by 13 after it start charge for admission . free access be essential to provide freedom of cultural and educational opportunity garrett , 2001 . 
counterpoint : not everyone wish to visit museum , which be essentially a form of entertainment for the middle class and tourist . the majority of adult never visit a museum , prefer instead leisure pursuit such a football , the cinema or clubbing . as philippe de montebello have wonder , if the public can pay for other event , what be it about art that shouldn t be pay for ? smith , 2006 why should they have to pay for their choose entertainment while subsidise the generally wealthy middle class through their tax ? tourists pay no tax here and so gain a free ride at the expense of domestic taxpayer . the state provide educational opportunity for all through free schooling , which often include free museum trip . if free museum entry be consider a cultural right , shouldn t the state make theatre ticket free a well ? 
point : museums be a crucial source of inspiration and education for our increasingly important creative industry e . g . art , design , fashion , and architecture . as the secretary of the national union of teachers describe , free access mean that every child can benefit from the treasure chest regardless of the depth of the parental pocket russell taylor , 2007 . free access be an investment in the future of both the education and creative sector of the economy and therefore have long term benefit in secure prosperity for the whole of society . similarly , tourism be an important sector of our economy and many visitor will be deter from visit our country if they think it will be very expensive to visit it great museum and gallery . tourists do contribute hugely to government revenue through the indirect tax they pay and the job they generate , tourism be a 115bn industry , bbc news , 2010 so free museum access to support the tourism industry be a sensible investment . 
counterpoint : such potential and economic benefit be dubious and rely upon access to collection that be excellent in their content and in the way in which they be conserve and display . if museum be to be fund entirely out of public money , the pressure on any government s budget from the demand of hospital , school , pension , etc . will inevitably mean that museum will come a poor second , result in under funding and poorer museum at the end of the process . this will not help our creative industry or tourism . it be excellence rather than the cost of visit attraction which attract tourist in any case ; acquisition budget have fall in both london and edinburgh over the last few year , our national gallery continually outbid by foreign rival a they seek to keep their collection contemporary hunt , 2011 . 
point : in the uk , labour government policy result in some of the lead national museum end admission charge . their policy be in response to evidence from the 1980s that suggest museum that start charge visitor saw their number plummet on average by a third and never fully recover barrie , 2001 . labour s policy shift have the effect of increase visitor number greatly , prove that free entry be beneficial in increase public exposure to culture . this can be show by the uk have the high number of visitor to art museum of any country base upon the art newspaper s figure for top 100 visited gallery in 2010 . the art newspaper , 2011 other country should follow this example in order to draw more people into their own national museum . 
counterpoint : entry figure do increase when the uk scrap admission charge at some museum , but study have find that this be not because more people actually visit the museum . instead similar number of people a before chose to make more individual visit to the same museum , push up admission number martin , 2003 . in this way subsidise free admission act a a giveaway of public money to the privilege middle class , who would in any case pay to attend the same institution . 
point : the contribution of government funding have be show to be capable of sustain the cost of a museum , prevent those cost be pass on to the public in the form of admission charge . the example of the british labour government fund national museum have be note above . the national museum of the american indian in washington be set up partially with government funding and partially with private fund , ensure it have remain free since it opening in 2004 democracy now , 2004 . in 2011 , china also announce that from 2012 all of it national museum would become publicly funded and cease charge admission fee zhu guo , 2011 . 
counterpoint : museums charge cannot be offset by government without use taxpayer money to subsidize the activity of only a portion of the population . as such , the actual cost of the museum be pass onto the population in the form of tax , rather than admission charge . this way however , all of the population be charge , instead of purely those whom utilize museum .
