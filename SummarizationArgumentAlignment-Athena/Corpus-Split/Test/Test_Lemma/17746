point : franglais have connotation of english and french conflict such a the norman conquest and the hundred years war and be a mark of disrespect and impertinence towards the french . 
counterpoint : there be a need for a progression in attitude . the past and political history should not impinge on our freedom to choose our own word in the modern day , particularly when those political division no longer exist . an example be that the english call a certain flower a sweet william , but the scots name it a stink billy a a result of the king who oppress the scots in favour of the english . however , england and scotland have be unify for some three hundred year . scotland have not elect independence , although such a party exist . therefore , the memory remain , reflect by and encase in this use of language , but the original emotion do not . 
point : how a people see the world be encase in the word they use to communicate with each other and the word they use to write song , poem and story about their people s history and experience . culture be inseparable from language . for example , the e on the end of a word that be silent in everyday speech becomes pronounce in french poetry and song when it figure on the end of a line , thus add an extra syllable to that line , and so femme on the end of a line of poetry would not be pronounce fam , but fam mer , and so an extra syllable result . this principal also help to create more rhyme within the poetry and song . therefore , in order to keep the french culture alive , we must too protect it home language from fall to the globally dominant language of english . this be why we need an increased awareness and presence of francophone art ; high quota of francophone song on the radio and the same of francophone programme on television . these two example demonstrate how the culture itself can be well protect when the language be well upheld . 
counterpoint : but these two nation do have share history and these anglicisms in the french language be only a reflection on this . for example , the british call a particular brass instrument a french horn , but the french call it un cor anglais , in translation , an english horn . certainly , how a people see the world be encase and reflect in the language they use , and their history and their relation with other nation be not separable from this vision of the world . au contraire , it be integral to it . it be unlikely that historical event embed so deep in memory that be reflect through language be likely to disappear just because certain word be deem unacceptable by a certain body like défense de la langue française . 
point : there be four level of french language . in descend order of formality these be ; précieux snobby , poetic , soutenu literary , write , courant public , administrative , familier informal language , non standard popular term , argotique very informal language , offensive if use in the wrong context or say to a stranger . 1 the middle ages ninth century fifteenth century saw the emergence of a new standard language , replace latin . 2 since french if not begin , at least grow up it have function with these four level of formality . franglais be not standard french , although many franglais noun un post it , un walkman would be acceptable in a formal context , and it presence , uprising and prevalence threaten the use and survival of the more formal version of the language . 
counterpoint : quod semper a it always be . french have previously relax the formality of it language and have always change by absorb foreign influence . 
point : the french often call the use of franglais anglo snobberie and those who use it a oppose to the standard version of their mother tongue anglo snob . 
counterpoint : language be spontaneous ; our choice of word be subconscious and word association be derive from the individual s own experience and vision of the world . no two people s choice of word will ever be identical . 
point : the french language cannot realistically survive if be not upheld a a relevant and respected language in official context . it be a very emotive and sensitive issue for the french people . the eu be found by a frenchman , robert schuman , france and germany be two of the five found member , the union be create to ally france with germany and before britain join , the french vetoed britain s entry . now , the french feel their part be europe be become dilute by the use of english . by force them to accept the english language in the context of an eu meeting only open the gate to make them accept the same rule a other nation ; if their own language be silence , so too be their voice of expression and opposition . 
counterpoint : english be a valid language in the european union . if m . chirac , m . sarkozy or any french leader wish to express him herself in this language in order to improve diplomacy with their neighbour across the channel , they have that very right .
