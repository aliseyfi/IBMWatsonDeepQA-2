point : there be many mechanism by which this policy could be implement . the one common thread be that those hop to receive organ would be divide into those register a donor , and those who be non donor . potential recipient who be non donor would only receive an organ if all request by donor for such an organ be fill . for example , if there be a scarcity of donated kidney with the b serotype , organ donor require a b kidney would all receive kidney before any non donor receive them . the exist metric for decide priority among recipient can still be apply within these list among both donor and non donor , individual could be rank on who receive an organ first base on who have be on the wait list longer , or who have more priority base on life expectancy ; this policy simply add the caveat that non donor only access organ once all donor for their particular organ be satisfy . what define a donor could vary ; it could be that they must have be a donor for a certain number of year , or that they must have be a donor prior to need a transplant , or even a pledge to become a donor henceforth and indeed , even if they be terminally ill and for other reason do not recover , some of their organ may still be usable . finally this policy need not preclude private donation or swap of organ , and instead can simply be apply to the public system . 
counterpoint : the controversial part of this plan be how the status of donor be determine . each standard that could be use have massive , and sometimes monstrous , negative ramification . if the requirement be that recipient be donor for a certain number of year beforehand , then people who have be donor for a substantial but still inadequate time be be perversely punish simply for not have be do their civic duty long enough see also past decision they cannot now undo point below . if the standard be simply that they must have be a donor for any amount of time , however small , prior to need the organ , this perversely encourage patient to hide their need for an organ long enough for them to register a donor and then collect their organ ; any attempt to solve this would require doctor to report on their patient need for organ , erode patient privacy and turn the doctor patient relationship adversarial . the last of the propose standard , that the recipient only need to sign up to be a donor in the future , cause all the allege benefit of this to policy evaporate ; the average person will not sign up to become a donor , a they know that they can always sign up later in the event that they need an organ . this plan only get any benefit whatsoever if healthy people be sign up to be donor a a cautionary measure , rather than a small group of sick and likely elderly people who only sign up when they need organ . in addition to reduce the pool of donor , such a standard which call for people to be donor from the time of their need onwards would require a massive breach of body right to enforce . in order to make it bind and prevent people from de register a donor once they no longer need organ , the state would have to say that they can no longer withdraw their consent to be donor , which amount to the state lay claim to their organ . 
point : the great argument for this policy be also the simple : it will save thousand , perhaps million of life . a policy of prioritize transplant for donor would massively increase the proportion of donor from the status quo of at best just over 30 confirmed organ donors . given the number of people who die under circumstance that render many of their organ useless , the rate of donor registration must be as high a possible . the overwhelming incentive that this policy would create to register may well eliminate the scarcity for certain organ altogether ; a bonus benefit of this would mean that for organ where the scarcity be eliminate , this policy would not even need to make good on it threat of denial of organ to non donor and even if this happen for every organ and thus reduce the incentive to register a a donor , the number of donor could only fall as far a until there be a scarcity again , thus revive the incentive to donate until the rate of donation reach an equilibrium with demand . 
counterpoint : there be alternative which be far more palatable mean of increase the rate of organ donation , spar u the moral quandary associate with deny organ to patient and coerce the populace to donate . an easy example be the opt out organ donation system , wherein all people be organ donor by default and need to actively remove themselves from the system in order to become non donor . this alternative turn every person who be indifferent to organ donation , currently a non donor , into a donor , while preserve the preference of those with a strong commitment not to donate . 
point : reciprocity be a basic moral principle : afford others the good treatment you yourself would like to receive . in most case , it be a hypothetical ; one must place oneself in the other person s position even though one will never actually be in their place . however , how donor and non donor be treat when they themselves be in need be a situation in which reciprocity become a practical reality . this principle of reciprocity suggest that people who be willing to donate their organ more deserve to receive organ when they need them . and there be good reason to believe in reciprocity . those who would flaunt this principle be basically state that they expect something of other people that they themselves be unwilling to do ; this be a position that be either incoherent , or base on the unjustified premise that oneself be more objectively valuable than other people . the concept of desert have a foundational role in our society . for example , innocent people deserve not to be put in prison , even if it would be useful to frame and make an example of an innocent person in order to quell a period of civil unrest . 
counterpoint : the principle of moral reciprocity do not require identical act . potential organ recipient who do their part for society in other way ought to be reward . we do not require that citizen repay firefighter by carry them out of burn building , because we recognize a certain division of the responsibility for make the world well . a system that purport to evaluate people s desert for life be an affront to the inherent human dignity that entitle every human be to life . see the right to healthcare be absolute point below . reciprocity mean treat others a we would like to be treat even if they don t do likewise for u . 
point : organ donation , in all it form , save life . more to the point , it save live with almost no loss to the donor . one obviously have no material need for one s organ after death , and thus it do not meaningfully inhibit bodily integrity to incentivize people to give up their organ at this time . if one be register a an organ donor , every attempt be still make to save their life organ donation faq . the state be always more justified in demand beneficial act of citizen if the cost to the citizen be minimal . this be why the state can demand that people wear seatbelt , but cannot conscript citizen for use a research subject . because there be no good reason not to become an organ donor , the state ought to do everything in it power to ensure that people do so . 
counterpoint : even grant the premise that people ought to donate their organ anyway , the role of the state be not to coerce people to do thing they ought to do . people ought to be polite to stranger , exercise regularly , and make good career choice , but the government rightly leave people free to do what they want because we recognize that you know what s good for you good than anyone else . moreover , the premise that people simply ought to donate their organ be highly contentious . many people do care deeply about what happen to them after they die ; even an enthusiastic organ donor would probably prefer that their body be treat respectfully after death rather than throw to dog . this concern for how one s body be treat after death affect the psychological wellbeing of the living . this be particularly true for member of some religion which explicitly prohibit the donation of organ . any government campaign that act a if it be one s duty to donate force them to choose between their loyalty to their belief and the state .
