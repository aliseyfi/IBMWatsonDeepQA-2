point : the spread of aids in the 80 and 90 show that education and information be more important than ever a exemplify by the slogan in the british 1980 s advertising campaign to prevent aids aids : don t die of ignorance . the campaign be credit with credit with change behaviour through warning on advert and inform through an information leaflet . 1 this show that education can work even when start from scratch . giving sex education in school be crucial to the spread of information to each successive generation , and may be supplement by frank discussion at home . 
counterpoint : while a serious disease , aids transmission make up only a tiny proportion of sexually transmit infection each year . 1 
point : young people express their sexuality a part of their development to adulthood . it be not have sex that be a problem , but have unsafe sex or hurting people through sexual choice . refusing to promote safe sex would mean not move with the time . just because school do not promote safe sex do not mean that adolescent will not experiment with sex . they will already be expose to sexual imagery and idea of sex so it be necessary that they be taught properly how to remain safe . 
counterpoint : to not promote abstinence be not a neutral position , it be a position the implicitly encourage sexual promiscuity . children be at risk of severe psychological and physical harm from have sex too young , and should be encourage not to do so . promoting safe sex be implicitly encouraging sex by imply that it be safe and a normal thing to be do . this will encourage young people to believe that there be no risk when this be not the case even if they do follow the prescription they have be teach about sex . 
point : the internet provide a vast amount of easily accessible information about sex , of vary degree of quality . most child in the west now have access to the internet and be therefore likely to have access to this information on sex , or at least educational material on sex even if the child s access to the internet be control . 
counterpoint : the problem with mandatory sex education be precisely that it present that information in an organised fashion by the state . in do so the right of the parent to raise their child in accordance with their structure of belief be usurped . 
point : with the age of consent be 16 and with young people be able to vote at 18 , it do not make sense for parent to have control over whether their child attend sex education class right up until the age of 19 or whenever they finish full time school . 
counterpoint : true , but nor do it make sense to make the class mandatory once the child reach an age where it be legally able to decide whether it want to partake of them . nor do this mean that these class need to be promote safe sex rather than simply teach the fact and encourage abstinence .
