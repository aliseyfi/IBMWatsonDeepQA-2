point : hate speech pose a clear danger to student and other member of the campus community . often , the hatred be direct towards minority group that be easily identifiable base on skin colour , clothing , or behaviour . because these minority be easy to identify , they can be target by those sway by the speaker s message . every hate crime be a tragedy and an attack against the principle of wlds . even when the message doesn t provoke violence , it can have a deep emotional harm on member of the target community . as such , the government have a duty to intervene to ensure that individual be safe . 1 
counterpoint : the government s primary duty be to protect the constitutional right of it citizen . censoring speech be a clear attack on the right to free expression . governments can use the criminal code to ensure people be protect . acts that physically harm people or directly encourage others to use violence be already illegal and these law can be enforce without violate an individual s constitutional right . 1 
point : while hate speech be a form of expression , it be not one that encourage dialogue . by promote hatred base on immutable personal characteristic it be by definition anti dialogue . hate speech do not contribute anything ; it merely provide a justification for violence and discrimination . extreme message , be they in word or through symbol , deter moderate from voice their opinion , either because they do not want to legitimize the message or out of fear of reprisal . this reduce the net dialogue on university campus and injure the quality of the dialogue that remain . 
counterpoint : hate speech can encourage dialogue and be positive . allowing hate speech provide an opportunity to combat and change the view of those who be promote hatred . in the long term this will lead to a reduction in violence through help air and then solve the underlying cause . 
point : members of group that find themselves the target of hate speech will be less likely to attend university where they feel target . as a result , those campus will become less diverse which will decrease the most effective deterrent of hateful idea : understanding through interaction . less muslim , gay , jewish , etc . student on campus be exactly what those promote hatred be try to achieve . less student of the targeted group make them easy to target because there be less people speak out against the hate speech . a downward spiral be create that , if not check , can drastically reduce campus diversity which be a massive harm to social integration and social harmony . speech code or other censorship send a signal to minority that they be welcome in the university . 1 
counterpoint : the need for interaction be all the more reason to ensure that all idea be in the marketplace . this way , the veracity of all idea be question . for example , if someone bring bigoted idea with them a a freshman , perhaps because these idea be prevalent in the community they grow up in , if they cannot express these idea and be challenge they may never attempt to integrate . instead , they will gravitate to those who share their idea and remain isolated . 
point : when individual feel that they will be target at a university base on who they be , they be less likely to attend that university either out of fear they will be discriminate against or because they believe that they will not be allow to express themselves freely without be discriminate against or assault . no group should be discourage from attain high education because of immutable personal characteristic . tertiary education be at the heart of social mobility and self actualization . even if no attack ever take place , because hate speech can create an atmosphere which deter member of society from attend university the state be justify in ban it . 
counterpoint : there be the potential for massive harm should universities become place where individual continuously need to contain their thought and idea for fear of sanction . it be far easy to actively promote open dialogue and tolerance a this will lead to more diversity .
