point : given that people be already allow to watch court proceeding from the public gallery include the judicial committee of the house of lords in the uk 1 , and the supreme court in the us 2 there be little reason why this should not be extend to give good access across the nation to anybody who want to watch . those with full time job or who live far away from the court be currently unfairly limit in this respect , and those who do wish to attend well publicised trial often have to arrive hour in advance to get a seat . individuals should not have to give up so much time and money just to be able to watch a democratic proceeding , which be a cornerstone of democratic nation . given that many close trial such a the trial of the guant√°namo bay terrorism suspect 3 have still lead to intense medium coverage , we would be good off show the court to be transparent and just instead of vainly try to hide everything behind closed door . 
counterpoint : when people take the time and effort to visit the law court and watch a case , it be a formal , regulate atmosphere . if this be televise , it would become close to entertainment than to fair , legal proceeding . it become a human interest story rather than a legitimate court case , where the focus be on moral retribution rather than fair application of the law . given that high profile case can go on for week , or even month , even if you be to broadcast every step of the court case it be likely that viewer would only tune in for the climax of the trial . this mean that they would miss important but perhaps comparatively boring step which lead to that conclusion ; it obscure the whole picture of the trial . 
point : it s difficult for people to have faith in a system which be normally hide from them . as long a the court proceed themselves be hidden , the public and the medium will continue to judge the judiciary base on unfortunate comment , or comment take out of context , by judge 1 2 . this mean that the legal system become distorted and confuse in the public eye . televising trial would dispel this image by prove the competence , efficiency and sensitivity of most judge in the legal system , and restore faith in it a a whole . 
counterpoint : video footage of court case will only serve to increase the soundbite culture of the medium , where particular quote or image be take out of context 1 and emphasise to the detriment of the rest of the trial . instead of simply be write down in newspaper , this motion would allow them to be relentlessly play back . televising court case do not come close to solve this problem . furthermore , the very reason why unfortunate quote from judge be repeat and criticise be because society recognises that they be out of keep with the general respect and intelligence of most judge in the legal system ; these individual be expose because they break away from the high quality of thought which the judicial system be see to represent . 
point : if these camera be introduce , then the public would have something to measure medium sensationalism against . instead of rely on journalistic evidence , the public would be able to literally see for themselves how the judge act , and how the victim and defendant appear . in 1981 , the case of chandler v florida prove that camera could operate in courtroom which do not inherently violate due process 1 while improve the transparency of courtroom to the general public . cameras in the courtroom will prevent the public from be mislead about the court proceeding . 
counterpoint : especially consider recent newspaper scandal such a the news of the world scandal 1 , most of the public should already be aware that newspaper be not always reliable , or even that they themselves will break the law to gain their information . furthermore , it be entirely possible that the judge , victim or defendent might appear differently if they know that their every move be be watch on national television ; what the public might read a nervous guilt on the behalf of the defendant might actually be a kind of stage fright . they could merely be nervous because an entire county be assess and judge them before a verdict have ever be reach . this measure do not help the public to see the truth ; rather , it encourage them to formulate an opinion before the judge and jury have speak . 
point : if the defendant be convict of a crime , they have a right to appeal in the uk 1 and us 2 . however , this be make difficult for another court to re ass the conviction if they cannot know how reliable evidence be in the first trial . without film recording of court trial , judge who have the duty to re examine the case be unable to see witness testimony ; though new evidence do sometimes come to light during the course of an appeal 3 , it would be easy to assess this new evidence if the judge also have knowledge of how the first trial go . if the judge could watch a video of the first trial , they could judge the demeanour , body language and general impression give by each witness in the first trial . body language can affect a court s perception of a witness 4 , but this information could not be gain by a transcript . however , this evidence may be important for a new verdict to be reach . 
counterpoint : a stenographer already record every word speak during the course of the trial , which already serve to help with potential appeal 1 2 . furthermore , appeal court judge rarely interfere with the verdict of low court because they be not present at the original trial . using a video record to overturn the verdict of a previous court would essentially eradicate the role of a jury ; which be to reach a decision base on the fact present , guide by the judge s knowledge of the law 3 4 . far from make court proceeding more democratic and transparent , use camera in courtroom would actually be damage because it undermine the position of normal people to reach a verdict of guilty or not guilty . in this case , a judge s choice to hang a new verdict on video information would make the law a very exclusive practice where very few individual can determine the fate of others , and the role of jury would become irrelevant . 
point : placing camera into courtroom encourage the judiciary and lawyer to increase their efficiency and have high standard of behaviour , because they be aware that it will be carry outside of the courtroom by public viewing . the introduction of camera to the houses of parliament in the uk result in significantly improve standard of debate , great punctuality , and great attendance of mps 1 . we can expect this same principle to continue in courtroom when camera be put in place . 
counterpoint : putting this kind of pressure on the judiciary and lawyer do not have the same kind of benefit that it might in the house of commons . politicians often focus on , and be expect to uphold , the general interest of the public , which be why have public access to televise debate be an incentive for them to push those interest through as far a possible . however , the rule of law do not always correlate to public opinion . particularly in high profile case , the public may wish to see the accuse give the harsh sentence possible ; however , this might not be the legally correct sentence to give in those circumstance . public outrage have be know to tamper with judicial verdict in place such a india 1 , and be damage to the principle of a fair trial .
