point : in many place in the world food be scarce ; tobacco farming use up land that could otherwise be use for food production . by subsidise tobacco farm state take away from their ability to provide food for their own citizen as well a their ability to export food to other area . 
counterpoint : the money people get from tobacco farming can be use to buy food in from other area . money from tobacco sale can be use to provide infrastructure , health facility and education1 . 
point : governments spend a huge amount of money on help people stop smoking ; in the uk the government spend annually annually 83 . 9m on service to help people stop smoking and a further 61 . 8m on stop smoking medication 1 . for the eu and state around the world to go out of their way to subsidise tobacco farm undermines these sort of public health initiative . governments should be consistent in their subsidy and tax rather than encourage an industry with subsidy and then take money away again with increase tax . 
counterpoint : countries like the uk may choose to spend money on help people stop smoke without any regard to the economy of tobacco produce country if they wish . however tobacco produce country do not owe anything to the uk and should not harm their own economy in order to help public health drive in country that be rich than themselves . 
point : it be nearly impossible to justify the state spending huge amount of money on something that cause such large amount of harm . about half of regular cigarette smoker will be eventually kill by their habit with 100 , 000 smoker die from smoke related cause every year in the uk . 1 
counterpoint : the state have no place whatsoever in dictate lifestyle choice to it citizen . citizens who choose to smoke be not ignorant of the risk ; they choose to smoke in spite of them . the state do however have a place support it economy . subsidies can help area of the economy grow where they would otherwise falter , create a huge number of job and possibly an industry that might be self sustain in the future . in the usa , which subsidise it's tobacco producer , an estimate 2 . 7 million job be dependent on the tobacco industry1 there would be a great harm on the american economy if subsidy be not maintain . given that tobacco farming be heavily concentrated take place in a few area in america , particularly around virginia and kentucky , it would be hard for the rest of the economy to 'pick up the slack' in these heavily dependent areas2 .
