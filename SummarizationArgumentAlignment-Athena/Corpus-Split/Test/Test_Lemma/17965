point : a federal europe would build upon the success of the eu and it predecessor in tame the nationalism that cause so much conflict in the twentieth century . the eu be draw nearer to realise the vision of it founder for an ever close union . despite the eu s relative success in this regard , while national government still exist they will regard policy make within europe a a competitive business , abuse veto and damage the potential prosperity of all of europe s citizen . such be the case with britain's veto over the carbon tax , which the eu want to implement the british government be highly likely to block european commission proposal for a carbon tax contain in a widely circulate draft version of the energy taxation directive , eu diplomatic source say yesterday . 1 
counterpoint : national identity and difference remain far more important than supposedly share european value . existing national government operate on different model which recognise the historical , cultural and economic distinctiveness of each nation , and thus provide an important focus for the loyalty of their citizen e . g . various monarchy , the french republican system , hallow by successive revolution . the further power be remove from a citizen , the more detached he be from the democratic process , the less accountable that power becomes , and the more likely it be to make decision badly , damage the interest of ten of million of people . 
point : a federal europe will be more advantageous for individual citizen , since they will be live in a powerful state , yet with respect of their cultural and local situation 
counterpoint : actually national government be more effective . the more authority international governing body , organization and institution have , the less can they afford to bother with local problem apply less effective problem solve procedure . not fully understanding local tension , burn issue in one particular area can , in the long term , bring great harm to the citizen of the whole federation . one spark can set ablaze a much large fire than a federal government can possibly imagine . therefore create one european federal body will shift the focus of the local problem and the problem of the average person to more global one which will be problematic on it own . furthermore the advantage in the face of connection to the political process , respect for local cultural tradition and responsiveness to differ economic and physical situation will not be achieve , because boundary fade away and people become more interested in the activity on a high level , rather than on small . 
point : a federal europe will be good equip to promote the interest of it citizen in the world , carry more influence in the un , wto , imf and other intergovernmental and treaty organisation than it individual state do now . furthermore , europe have a lot to contribute to the world in term of it liberal tradition and political culture , provide both a partner and a necessary balance to the usa in global affair . 
counterpoint : actually if the eu become a unified state , there would be s loss of un seats a major democratic , liberal voting block in international institution such a the un would be lose , in return for one vote for an incredibly powerful state . due to the uk and france , both eu member and also un security council permanent member unsc p5 along with the us , china and russia , and with germany g4 along with india , japan and brazil hopeful to gain a seat in the future , removal of these nation from the unsc would leave it open to great sway by american , russian or chinese influence . as it be , the uk and france provide a powerful voting bloc in the sc . italy have offer the plan of a revolving seat for eu member state . . therefore country from the eu be powerful enough a it be and create only 1 country can result in the exact opposite situation . 
point : the success of federal state elsewhere in provide peace and prosperity for their citizen , alongside democratic safeguard , point to the advantage of pursue this model in europe . the usa , australia and canada provide standard of living for their citizen which most europeans would envy , while federal india be the best example of a long term democratic success in the developing world . 
counterpoint : europe be not like america and australia , which be found by immigrant with considerable homogeneity of language and culture . canada s relation with quebec show that where such difference exist they can be politically destabilising , while federal state such a brazil and the ussr have not avoid dictatorship , human right problem and economic backwardness . within the eu there be often no commonality of interest on key federal issue such a defence and foreign policy . even today there be big split on major issue such a agricultural reform and trade policy . 
point : in a globalised economy , there be a need to tame multinational corporation , which would be otherwise capable of play national government off against each other in search for low wage , social cost and state protection . a federal europe would be powerful enough to demand high standard of behaviour from such company , because only a powerful and economically significant player can dictate restricting condition . this would ensure fair wage , safe work condition and additionally europe would be able to force the multinational company to implement correct and holistic policy and would also be in a position to make a great difference on environmental issue such a global warming . sovereignty become less relevant when effective independence be lose anyway a the economy and the problem face by all nation be increasingly globalise . 
counterpoint : the assumption about the multinational corporation be not actually prove . national government close deal with such corporation if both side have interest in it . even if we assume such a thing exist nowadays in a federal europe the same problem would occur only not with country , rather with region . that be because every region would want the company to create more business in it area so we will end up with the assumed status quo today . 
point : federalism and subsidiarity , that thing should be deal with at the low , most local , level possible , 1 can allow for regional identity in a way national state cannot . for example for northern ireland , corsica , basque region , lombardy . in a federal europe such people would not feel under threat from a dominant culture and long running conflict could be resolve , a issue of sovereignty become less relevant within the new political structure . 
counterpoint : devolution and subsidiarity can be apply by exist state , a britain and france have both show in the 1990s , and a germany have do since 1945 . spain s problem with separatist terrorist in the basque region show that even a great deal of regional autonomy fail to satisfy extremist .
