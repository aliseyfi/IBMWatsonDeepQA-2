point : in recent year , supposedly innocent site such a social networking site have be purposely use to harm others . victims of cyber bullying have even lead victim to commit suicide in extreme case 1 2 . given that both physical 3 and psychological 4 damage have occur through the use of social networking site , such site represent a danger to society a a whole . they have become a medium through which others express prejudice , include racism , towards group and towards individual 5 . similarly , if a particularly country have a clear religious or cultural majority , it be fair to censor those site which seek to undermine these principle and can be damage to a large portion of the population . if we fail to take the measure require to remove these site , which would be achieve through censorship , the government essentially fail to act on it principle by allow such site to exist . the government have a duty of care to it citizen 6 and must ensure their safety ; censor such site be the best way to achieve this . 
counterpoint : while in a tiny minority of case , such social networking site can be use malevolently , they can also be a powerful force for good . for example , many social networking page campaign for the end to issue such a domestic abuse 1 and racism 2 , and facebook and twitter be even use to bring citizen together to clean the street after the riot in the uk in 2011 . 3 furthermore , this motion entail a broad move to blanket ban area of the internet without outline a clear divide between what would be ban and what would not . for example , at what point would a website which discuss minority religious view be consider undesirable ? would it be at the expression of hatred for national of that country , in which case it might constitute hate speech , or not until it tend towards promote action i . e . attack other group ? allowing censorship in these area could feasibly be construe a obstruct the free speech of specified group , which might in fact only increase militancy against a government or culture who be perceive a oppress their right to an opinion of belief 4 . 
point : we already set boundary on what constitute free speech within our society . for example , we often endorse a balancing act 1 an individual may express their belief or opinion , but only up to the point where it do not impede the protection of other human right 2 other people right not to be abuse . in this case , if an individual express abuse towards another especially racism they may be deem to be outside of the boundary or free speech and can be punish for it . this motion be simply an extension of this principle ; the kind of site which would be ban be those which perpetuate hatred or attack other group in society , an so already fall outside of the protection of free speech . the harm that stem from these kind of site outweigh any potential harm from limit speech in a small number of case . 
counterpoint : outright ban this kind of prejudice do not directly tackle it it ignore it . a good way for the government to tackle derogatory and prejudicial speech be to engage with it in a public forum and reasonably point out the flaw and ignorance that it embody , rather than desperately try to hide it from public view . in this way , those who be be attack by these website would feel a if the government be actively protect them and their right and punish those who have violate them , rather than simply close a few website and allow their author to continue in other way . this motion do not solve the problem of prejudice in the way it claim to . 
point : some government , such a the vietnamese government 1 , have already see sufficient cause to ban social network site such a facebook . recently in the uk , many major city witness devastation and destruction a social networking site be use to co ordinate wide scale riot which rampage over london , manchester , birmingham , worcestershire , gloucester , croydon , bristol , liverpool and nottingham 2 . rioters contact each other through facebook and blackberry instant messenger to ensure that they could cause maximum damage 3 , which result in the destruction of property 4 , physical violence towards others 5 , and even the death of three young men 6 . these event prove that seemingly innocent internet site can be use by anybody , even apparently normal citizen , to a devastate effect which have cause harm to thousand 7 . to protect the population and maintain order , it be essential that the government be able to act to censor site that can be use a a forum and a tool for this kind of behaviour when such disruption be occur . 
counterpoint : given the number of people who actually use facebook 1 and other social networking site , these occurrence be remarkably small 2 . these riot cannot be attribute to facebook ; it be the mindset of the rioter rather than facebook itself which provide the raw determination for these riot to occur . if facebook have be censor , they may have simply use mobile phone to co ordinate their action instead . censoring these site would not prevent such event , and would anger those who use facebook to communicate with friend 3 and share photo 4 innocently . 
point : under the status quo , state already regulate other form of medium that could be use malevolently . newspapers and book be subject to censorship 1 , and medium such a television , film and video receive a high degree of regulation 2 because it be widely recognise that move picture and sound can be more emotive and powerful than text and photograph or illustration . the internet have many mean of portray information and opinion , include film clip and sound , and almost all the information find on television or in newspaper can be find somewhere on the internet 3 , alongside the million of uploads from internet user themselves 4 . 
counterpoint : any information from television or newspaper have already be regulate , so it be not a problem that it may now appear somewhere on the internet . it be exactly because the internet be a forum for free information and expression that so many people engage with it ; remove this be a dictatorial move against ordinary citizen who seek information without bias and undue censorship .
