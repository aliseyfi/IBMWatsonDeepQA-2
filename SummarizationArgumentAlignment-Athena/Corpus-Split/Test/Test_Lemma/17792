point : palestinians and israelis will not be able to live together in peace in the same state any time in the foreseeable future . the idea that palestinians and israelis can live in peace and harmony in one state , with tolerance for each other and in keep with democratic principle of inclusion , be simply naive . this idea have be make impossible by nearly a century of direct conflict between these people . while this might change in coming century , it be unacceptable to adopt a one state policy now base on these naive idea . 
counterpoint : simply because past conflict have exist be no reason to believe that peace and understanding cannot be establish through co operation , share institution and interaction . this be exactly what a one state solution would foster in the long term , but which a two state solution prevents by separate the two community . even if they each have a state of their own , unless the israelis and palestinians learn to live in proximity to each other in co operation , there will be no peace . 
point : as describe in the above quote by peres , the vast majority of israelis desire to live in a jewish homeland in which they can define their own institution and culture in light of their jewish heritage . a one state solution , however , would undermine israel's legitimacy and internationally recognize right to exist a a sovereign jewish state in the land of the jewish forefather . 
counterpoint : the two state solution would have israel relinquish the west bank , know to the israelis a judea and samaria . yet , these be historic region to the jews . israel would similarly have to undermine it identity to give up these two region , and so any two state solution acceptable to israel would have to mean the retention of judea and samaria . because of the large palestinian population in the west bank , even a two state solution would mean israel could not be both jewish and democratic . 3 
point : a two state solution can offer sufficient territory for both israelis and palestinians . for israel this would mean keep the vast majority of area inhabit by israeli citizen within the state of israel . the two state solution would also , however , offer sufficient land to the palestinians . 
counterpoint : palestinian support for two state solution decline around 2008 , and be wan even among the 'moderate' palestinian camp , as well a among additional arab element . 8 it be also na√Øve to think that a two state solution would gain the favour or even support of iran . iran want to be the dominant power in the middle east , and it want nuclear weapon so that it can threaten not only israel but other state in the region . 9 to this end , iran have an incentive to keep the israeli palestinian conflict big and bloody so a to distract the west from it own regional agenda . furthermore , an independent palestinian state would probably be perceive a a security threat to some of it neighbour , particularly jordan , and thus might actually prompt further tension . 9
