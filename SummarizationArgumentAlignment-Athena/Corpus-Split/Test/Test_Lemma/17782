point : only intent , not the word nigger , can be racist . the word nigger be not racist . a word can never be racist , the only way a word be racist if it be use with racist intent and explain that way . there be other word besides nigger that be just as offensive because of the connotation , like eggplant . the word by itself have no meaning ; the history of the word and the situation in which the word be use brings the word to life . the term be both endear and disrespectful depend on the situation in which it use . for example i can say you're my nigga ! and it's review a positive or i can say you're a nigga , and it can be see a negative . the common debate about this word doesn't exist so much with how to use it , but more so who use it . 
counterpoint : regardless of intent , the n word still carry extremely negative connotation with america s dark past . many african americans see the word a dehumanise give the mailicious context it be commonly use in during the post reconstruction era . to use the word now , even in a humourous , endear context would be to at best , disregard the suffering of the past which be evoke by the word , or bad make something as grave a the abuse suffer into a figure for fun . either way it be best if the word be not use by anyone to avoid such risk of offence . 1 
point : meaning of word shift over time ; nigger have soften . there be a time when the word black be offensive when describe african americans . the word black be use to define everything in a negative way , african americans prefer to be call negro or colored in the late 1800s and most of the 1900s . it wasn't until figure like stokely carmichael , adam clayton powell , malcolm x , huey p . newton , james brown , syl johnson , tommie smith and john carlos begin to endorse black power and black be beautiful do african americans associate themselves with black a a signal of positivity . 1 prior to the black panther era , black be just as negative a nigger . the fact that the word have be switch from negative to positive , show that language can be manipulate and change with the time . 2 
counterpoint : the use of the word black be bind to shift a americans grow more enlightened in the post civil rights era . black be the word of a colour and it usage in term of one s race be intentioned a a description of appearance , in the same way that white be the name of a colour use to describe the racial appearance of caucasians . the n word on the other hand be a bastardisation of a legitimate spanish word to create a demeaning insult . 1 it be unnatural unlike the word black and thus should not be attempt to be treat a such . 
point : a dangerous double standard have emerge over the use of the word nigger . it be acceptable depend on who use it . a black person can say it and it can be endear , but if an outside race use it , it be automatically racist . difficulties can arise from it use be misinterpret purely on the race of the person use it . surely it be best for all if such an anomaly be remove by make it acceptable for all people to use the word within the change context highlight earlier in the debate . if this happen , then accusation of preferential treatment towards african americans with regard to the use of word can no longer be use a a pretext for barely disguise prejudice which be still prevalent in society . 
counterpoint : the controversy over whether it be acceptable for non black to use the word clearly underlines why the word should not be use in civilised conversation . the n word still evoke painful reminder of the suffering of black americans at the hand of oppressive white , thus create the automatic assumption of malice when a white person use it , regardless of context . surely it be best for the purpose of clarity and understanding between the race that all people be prevent from use the n word .
