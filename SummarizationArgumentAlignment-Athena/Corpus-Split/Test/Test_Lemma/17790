point : the problem with google censor it result , be that in do so , it be complicit in china s repression of free speech : it adapt it own search engine to display only the result the chinese government want , thereby limit it citizen basic human right to free access to information a corollary to free speech . by avoid this complicity , google be take a bold , praiseworthy step towards enhance respect for human right in china and with it , google can set an important example for other business with dealing in china . 1 
counterpoint : not censor doesn t advance human right in china at all 
point : google s corporate motto be don t be evil . this be partly an issue of corporate identity , and partly a clever business proposition . in both case , comply with chinese censorship rule damage google a a company . 
counterpoint : this doesn t enhance google s business proposition at all 
point : google s decision to stop censoring be world news , and have put internet freedom on everyone s agenda even so much so , that u . s . secretary of state mention internet company gang up to censor the chinese corner of the internet specifically a a threat to freedom worldwide in a recent speech . 1 this help to inform ordinary citizen of other country who may not know about the great firewall what the chinese government be do . by make a high profile decision like this , and by engage and inform the government and public of free and democratic country like this , google increase the public and political pressure on china to change it way . 
counterpoint : china win t budge that easily
