point : participation in sport promotes health . the effect on self esteem and well be a a product of sport can only be experience by certain child if force by their school to first participate . a recent report to the european parliament declare 'physical education be a springboard for involvement in sport and physical activity throughout life 1 . government be , or should be , concern with the health of it citizen . encouraging physical activity in the young through compulsory pe fight child obesity and contributes to form lifelong habit of exercise . this doesn t have to be through traditional team sport ; increasingly school be able to offer exercise in the form of swimming , gymnastics , dance , weight training , use of a multi gym , aerobics , etc 
counterpoint : it be a red herring to say that pe make any serious difference to people's health . there be plenty of more effective way of ensure a healthy population than push child round a freezing sport pitch once a week ; not least would be address the disgust diet our young have today , and encourage walking or cycling to school rather than total reliance on the car . both method would involve promote a healthy lifestyle without force the participation in unpopular physical education class that do little for one's education . 
point : physical education help to forge character and the mutual respect require to succeed in an adult environment . playing team sport build character and encourage student to work with others , a they would be expect to do in most business or sporting environment . sport teach child how to win and lose with good grace and build a strong school spirit through competition with other institution . it be invaluable to imbue with child the delicate balance between a competitive rivalry that encourage effort and , on the other hand , lose the fairness and respect require to enjoy sport . it be often the experience of play on a team together which build the strong friendship at school , which endure for year afterwards . as be note in a report to the european parliament , 'pe . . . help child learn to respect and value their own body and ability , and those of others' 1 . compulsory physical education be the only mean by which all child can be force to appreciate such advantage . 
counterpoint : physical education undermines one's character as much a it strengthen and forge it . for every future athlete who grow in stature a he become comfortable in a team environment , there be a number of academic student who be force weekly to cope with the brutality and criticism of others more gift at specific sport . values like respect be not teach on a football field , any glance at a professional football match lead inexorably to that conclusion . furthermore , learn about teamwork and co operation no longer require hour spend play sport ; they can be taught just a accurately and effectively in a classroom through music , drama , community project , etc . without the need to encourage an ultra competitive ethos . 
point : the quest for national sporting achievement begin in school . if school don't have compulsory pe , it be much hard to pick out , develop and equip athlete to represent the country on a wider stage . even with a 'sports academy' model run along australian line , it's much easy to find suitable individual with a full sport program in every school . in the uk seventy per cent of state school student be drop pe when it become optional ; it be no surprise that up to 30 of it olympic athlete be now privately educate , where physical education be compulsory until the end of one's education 1 . state education be not just about aid the individual it s also about the state get a good return on it investment in a well educate populace to drive business and entrepreneurialism etc . this apply equally in sport . 
counterpoint : schools aren't suppose to be about foster achiever for the state that smack of stalinism . schools should be tailor to the individual if the individual student doesn t want to participate in sport , they shouldn t have to . if we allow such national aim to be consider in school , would we consent to humiliation of those that do badly in maths lesson , to encourage their achievement in math and thus business skill ? of course not . but we allow that in pe . 
point : without school support , sport will collapse . if compulsory physical education class aren't in place , then team activity will end by sheer lack of number , no matter if several very talented individual be at the school or even potentially talented they ll never know without the program . new survey in the united kingdom have find that they expect to see a fall in sport event provide in school due to cost cutting , despite the upcoming olympics inspire student to want to compete 1 . if voluntary take up of sport in school be too low , then school will shut down pe programme so that there be no choice at all . not everyone be academic : why deprive those talented sport student of their one chance to shine ? athletes who lack academic prowess be require to stick at class like math even if it appear obvious their career path be in sport ; why should mathematicians escape from their respective obligation to compete in sport ? 
counterpoint : forcing child that don't want to play to make up team in order to allow others to shine smack of rigid education from a bygone era . learning about teamwork and co operation no longer require hour spend play sport ; they can be taught just a accurately and effectively in a classroom with altogether more academic and conducive activity . in any case , in an increasingly litigious age , a compulsory rather than voluntary sport program be a liability . more and more school be avoid the very team game e . g . rugby , soccer , hockey , football to the realistic fear of lawsuit when injury and dispute occur . 
point : compulsory pe lesson can be treat in the same manner an ordinary educational class be treat ; if the student refuse to participate and therefore do not do their work , they be punish with extra work of that same class . in this case , that would necessitate added physical education exercise at a late date or immediately after the class . the excuse that the student do not wish to participate in the class should be see a no different to if it be state during a math or english class , where it would not be accept . the fact that physical education be qualitatively different to those class be irrespective ; once deem a compulsory subject , and therefore beneficial , it must be accept and complete . 
counterpoint : the intention of advocate a healthy lifestyle and sport be lose if there be a punishment attach to the class . furthermore , to expect all student to participate in a class that be so overtly embarrass to the weak athlete be almost state sanction bullying . in a maths class , the working and answer of the weak student be not parade in front of the class for all to see , and if they try to stop this , keep behind for extra work . it be demonstrably unfair to ask student , fragile about their appearance a it be , to compete physically with classmate . it should be encourage , but maintain voluntary for those who wish to do so . the others can still be teach about healthy living and exercise without be drag into physical exertion .
