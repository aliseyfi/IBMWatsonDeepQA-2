point : an individual or firm with a monopoly right to the production of something may not have the ability to efficiently go about meet demand for it . intellectual property right slow , or even stop the dissemination of such idea and invention , a it may prove impossible to sway the creator to license or to market the product . such an outcome be deleterious to society , a with the free sharing of idea , an efficient producer , or producer , will emerge to meet the need of the public1 . a similar harm arises from the enervate effect intellectual property right can generate in people and firm . when the incentive be to simply rest on one's patent , wait to for them to expire before do anything else , societal progress be slow . in the absence of intellectual property , firm and individual be necessarily force to keep innovating to stay ahead , to keep look for profitable product and idea . the free flow of idea generate by the abolition of intellectual property right will invigorate economic dynamism . furthermore , many firm that develop and patent idea do not share them , nor do they act upon them themselves do to their unprofitability . this have be the case with various treatment for predominantly develop world disease , which exist but be unprofitable to distribute to where they be need most , in part of africa and asia . 2 with no intellectual property right , the access to such drug would be facilitate and producer interested in help the sick rather than simply profit would be able to help those in need leave to die due to intellectual property . 1 stim , rishand . 2006 . profit from your idea : how to make smart licensing decisions . berkeley : nolo . 2 boseley , sarah . 2006 . rich countries 'blocking cheap drugs for developing world' . the guardian . 1 
counterpoint : there be no significant slow down of the spread of information in the long run , since intellectual property generally only last for a short time , mean owner have an incentive to make the most of it while they can . besides , any small slow down of the spread of idea and innovation be a small price to pay for the recognition of a person's fundamental right to the product of his effort . furthermore , license arrangement be become more and more refined to allow for the quick transfer of right in order to meet societal demand for product . licensing law have also begin to extend to product that producer may not wish to produce , such a medication for sick africans , and be help to force firm that refuse to act upon their patent to license the right to those that will . 
point : many firm cannot act independently , but rather rely on the technology and system of other firm . the complicate , and often convolute , license arrangement need by many firm to function sap resource and effort , slow productivity and cause general economic sluggishness . in high tech and science research firm particularly , mutual licensing pact be need that often slow production and advancement due to the complicated legal arrangement that must be enter into to allow firm to go about their business . for example , the recent battle over right to computer technology between hewlett packard and oracle , which have cost both firm million of dollar in legal fighting1 . these cost be entirely mitigate in the absence of intellectual property right , a idea flow freely and people can go about their business without the complication of licensing . 1 orlowski , andrew . 2011 . oracle and itanic : tech's nastiest ever row ? . the register . 5 
counterpoint : the complication in the legal framework be not reason to eliminate intellectual property right . in fact , most licensing arrangement be do swiftly and amicably between firm . intellectual property battle over licensing arrangement be the exception rather than the rule . with intellectual property , firm feel free to share openly through licensing . without it , they will be more reticent to share anything . 
point : intellectual property right system create perverse incentive in firm , lead them to inefficiently allocate resource . one such inefficiency arises from the duplication of effort by firm seek to develop the same process or product , though only the first to do so may profit from it . this lead to brutal race and excessive expenditure of resource to be first over the line and to monopolize the production , at least for a time . another serious inefficiency arises in the production of similar product to exist one , seek to get around exist intellectual property right . such have be the case for year in the pharmaceutical industry , which have succeed in cure erectile dysfunction dozen of time . an overemphasis on such spin off of similar product be the result of intellectual property right pervert incentives1 . furthermore , intellectual property right create the problem of corporate espionage . firms seek to be the first to develop a new product so a to patent it will often seek to steal or sabotage the research of other compete firm so a to be the first to succeed . without intellectual property right , such theft would be pointless . clearly , in the absence of intellectual property , market and firm will behave more efficiently . 1 gabb , sean . 2005 . market failure and the pharmaceutical industry : a proposal for reform . national health federation . 6 
counterpoint : the cost of research and development of new product be often extremely high for firm . in order to reap a profit from their effort , they must be able to count on the guarantee of ownership over their intellectual property . in the absence of such a guarantee , the incentive of firm to research and innovate decline substantially , result in a less dynamic business climate . the duplication of effort by research firm be rare in practice , and the effort to develop spin off product can easily become the beginning of entirely new inventive project . 
point : the state incurs huge cost in monitor for intellectual property right infringement , in arrest suspected perpetrator , in imprisonment of those find guilty , even though in reality nothing be steal but an idea that , once release to it , belong to the public domain . the united states government , for example , project cost of investigate intellectual property claim will cost 429 million between 2009 and 20131 . firms likewise devote great amount of resource and effort to the development of non duplicable product , in monitoring for infringement , and in prosecute offender , all of which generate huge cost and little or no return2 . furthermore , the deterrent effect to intellectual property piracy generate by all the effort of the state and firm have prove generally minimal . this be because in many case intellectual property right be next to unenforceable , a the music and movie industry have learn in recent year . only a tiny handful of perpetrator be ever catch , and though they be often punish severely in an attempt to deter future crime , it do little to stop it . intellectual property , in many case , simply do not work in practice ; firm should move with the time and recognize they need to innovate in way that will compensate . 
counterpoint : it may be costly and sometimes ineffective to police property right , but that do not make them less of a right . efficiency and justice be not the same thing . if firm feel they can benefit from fight infringers of their intellectual property right , it be their right to do so . the state likewise , have an obligation to protect the right , physical and intangible , of it citizen and cannot give up on them simply because they prove difficult and costly to enforce . for the state the cost accrue by effort to enforce intellectual property be repay many fold by the fact that business feel safer to invest in them due to the perceive protection the state promise . 
point : an individual's idea , so long a it rest solely in his mind or be keep safely hidden , belongs to him . when he disseminate it to everyone and make it public , it become part of the public domain , and belongs to anyone who can use it . if individual or firm want to keep something a secret , like a production method , then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product . one should not , however , expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one have , since no such ownership right exists1 . no one can own an idea . thus recognize something like a property right over intangible asset be contrary to reason , since do so give monopoly power to individual who may not make efficient or equitable use of their invention or product . physical property be a tangible asset , and thus can be protect by tangible safeguard . ideas do not share this right to protection , because an idea , once speak , enter the public domain and belongs to everyone . 1 fitzgerald , brian and anne fitzgerald . 2004 . intellectual property : in principle . melbourne : lawbook company .
