point : perhaps the most basic and fundamental of all our right . however , with every right come a choice . the right to speech do not remove the option to remain silent ; the right to vote brings with it the right to abstain . in the same way , the right to choose to die be implicit in the right to life . the degree to which physical pain and psychological distress can be tolerate be different in all human . quality of life judgement be private and personal , thus only the sufferer can make relevant decision . 1 this be particularly evident in the case of daniel james . 2 after suffer a spinal dislocation a the result of a rugby accident he decide that he would live a second rate existence if he continue with life and that it be not something he want to prolong . people be give a large degree of autonomy within their life and since decide to end your life do not physically harm anyone else , it should be within your right to decide when you wish to die . while the act of suicide do remove option to choose life , most case in which physician assist suicide be reasonable , death be the inevitable and often imminent outcome for the patient regardless if by suicide or pathological process . the choice for the patient , therefore , be not to die , but to cease suffering and tto choose the time and manner of their death . 
counterpoint : there be no comparison between the right to life and other right . when you choose to remain silent , you may change your mind at a late date ; when you choose to die , you have no such second chance . arguments from pro life group suggest that nearly ninety five percent of those who kill themselves have be show to have a diagnosable psychiatric illness in the month precede suicide . the majority suffer from depression that can be treat . 1 if they have be treat for depression as well a pain they may not have want to commit suicide . participating in someone s death be also to participate in deprive them of all choice they might make in the future , and be therefore immoral . 
point : the gradual decline of their body , the failure of their organ and the need for artificial support . in some case , the illness will slowly destroy their mind , the essence of themselves ; even if this be not the case , the huge amount of medication require to control their pain will often leave them in a delirious and incapable state . at least five percent of terminal pain cannot be control , even with the best care . faced with this , it be surely more humane that those people be allow to choose the manner of their own end , and have the assistance of a doctor to die with dignity . one particular account be of sue rodriguez who die slowly of lou gehrig's disease . she live for several year with the knowledge that her muscle would , one by one , waste away until the day come when , fully conscious , she would choke to death . she beg the court to reassure her that a doctor would be allow to assist her in choose the moment of death . they refuse . rodriguez do not accept the verdict and with the help of an anonymous physician commit suicide in february 1994 . 1 
counterpoint : modern palliative care be immensely flexible and effective , and help to preserve quality of life as far a be possible . there be no need for terminally ill patient ever to be in pain , even at the very end of the course of their illness . it be always wrong to give up on life . the future which lie ahead for the terminally ill be of course terrifying , but society s role be to help them live their life as well a they can . this can take place through counselling , help patient to come to term with their condition . 
point : the impact on the family who remain can be catastrophic . often because they be unaware of how their love one be feel . suicide case such a megan meier , an american teenager who commit suicide by hang herself in 2006 , 1 a the parent have to launch police investigation into why their child might have felt so desperate . by legalise assist suicide , the process can be bring out into the open . in some case , family might have be unaware of the true feeling of their loved one ; be force to confront the issue of their illness may do great good , perhaps even allow them to persuade the patient not to end their life . in other case , it make them part of the process : they can understand the reason behind their decision without feeling of guilt and recrimination , and the terminally ill patient can speak openly to them about their feeling before their death . 
counterpoint : demanding that family take part in such a decision can be an unbearable burden : many may resent a loved one s decision to die , and would be either emotionally scar or estrange by the prospect of be in any way involve with their death . assisted suicide also introduce a new danger , that the terminally ill may be pressure into end their life by others who be not prepared to support them through their illness . even the most well regulated system would have no real way to ensure that this do not happen .
