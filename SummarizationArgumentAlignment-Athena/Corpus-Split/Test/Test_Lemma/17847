point : since the fall of communism , russia have plunge into a deep economic recession . the introduction of market reform and privatization have lead to a swift increase in inequality couple with an increase in corruption . the chaos of economic and political reform , along with the chaos of the break up of former ussr , have leave the majority of the population both disillusion and distrustful of their government . in a period of such chaos , stability seem to be much more important than reform . a strong leader be the only solution to provide such stability , set a clear direction and pull a country at risk of fall apart together again . this be also prove from various poll among the russian population the most eye catch statistic be the overwhelming majority of respondent who say that order be more important for russia than democracy 72 per cent , with 16 per cent respond conversely . 1 
counterpoint : all period of transition have be chaotic by definition and reform be by their nature disruptive . at the same time , it be only through these reform that a future of freedom and prosperity be possible . while a long transition process can certainly cloud mind and turn people into distrustful and disillusioned individual , one must keep in mind that it be precisely at these moment that the risk of authoritarian tendency re emerge be high . the people of russia agree in poll over and over again that democracy be and should be their future . we must not let the immediate chaos of reform scare u into a fake stability . even if still russians prefer strong leadership the number of these people be decrease and the tendency show that more and more be start to evaluate the true value of democracy but that number be actually down from the last time vtsiom conduct a similar survey in 2000 , when 75 per cent of russians say they favor order , and 13 per cent democracy . 1 
point : putin be the strong leader that russia have be wait for . his electoral success and consistently high approval rate show that the people of russia be ready for someone who can rid their society of increase corruption and restore a sense of calm and equality . his ability to maintain a high level of support despite what some have call authoritarian tendency show that people be ready to sacrifice a certain degree of freedom for the promise of stability . enthusiasm for putin among the young also show that he do not only appeal to those look back to past certainty . 
counterpoint : putin s initial support be base mainly on strong promise , a series of arrest of corrupt businessmen and tough action towards chechnya that at first seem to give positive result . his support base , however , have be significantly damage follow his increase tendency to control the medium and to replace elected governor with presidential appointee , and by scandal surround the disappearance and murder of several important journalist . he have lose the support of the ngo community and most of the intelligentsia and also the originally strong backing of the usa and president bush . 
point : putin s authoritarian style be not a threat to democracy but rather a requirement for a successful and quick transition . having putin control the medium be probably healthy than have it be control by a corrupt few that promote their personal interest rather than the interest of the state and thus those of the population at large . democracy be a goal and while certain country believe themselves to have achieve it , they be constantly struggle to maintain it . as a young democracy , russia be still work towards define it own version of democracy and find what work best in it case . 
counterpoint : putting your hope and trust in a single person can be fairly dangerous , particularly in a transition period . putin be not the state and his ability to control and represent the state and the population at large be questionable . putin be also not a saint and an example to be follow . his authoritarian tendency do not have insignificant effect : at this point most russian medium be control by the state , decision continue to be make behind closed door without consultation , russia have once again become the pariah of the international community , the chechen conflict have spill into new attack against civilian result in the death of thousand of people include child one only have to mention the horrible attack in beslan and the moscow theatre , etc , etc . putin s stubborn refusal to accept international help in the case of the stuck submarine kursk also result in the unnecessary death of ten of people . 
point : historically , russia have always need strong centralised leadership for it to make progress . this be true both in imperial time under tsar such a peter the great who make russia a european power and build st petersburg and alexander ii who free the serf , and since 1917 under lenin and stalin . russia be too big , too diverse and too thinly populate for western system of representative democracy to be apply . culturally it people be temperamentally suit to follow the decisive lead of a strong ruler who can unite them in the face of great challenge . without such a ruler russia be likely to fragment with local strongman grab power in the region , religious fundamentalism dominate much of the caucasus and central asia , and economic stagnation . 
counterpoint : history be not destiny and a highly selective view of russia's past should not lead u to prefer authoritarian rule today . the tsars and their communist successor kill million of people through brutal rule and fail policy make possible by the same lack of consultation and accountability that we see in russia today . only a vigorous multi party democracy , fully independent legal system and free medium can ensure that the disaster of the past be not repeat . nor be there any reason why such a system could not take root in russia it be no more diverse than many other country and modern communication mean that mere distance be not a problem . and there be nothing in the culture or temperament that make russians uniquely unsuited to democracy .
