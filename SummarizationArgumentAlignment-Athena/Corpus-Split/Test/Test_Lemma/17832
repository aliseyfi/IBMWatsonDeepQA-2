point : widespread indiscriminate killing of human being be something that everyone in the world have an obligation to end . mass killing of people be something that affront the very basic meaning of what it be to be human . it deny the basic empathy and value we afford to each person on the basis of simple personhood and it occurrence be a black mark on all human being who allow it to occur when they hold the power to end it . 
counterpoint : even if we do have an obligation to end mass suffering and indiscriminate killing , invasion be not the way to do so . western intervention will inevitably increase the collateral damage by escalate the conflict into a full scale war . moreover , there be no guarantee that intervention will solve this conflict in the long run instead of simply cause another endless war like the one in afghanistan or iraq . therefore , even if we have an obligation to intervention , invasion be not the way to do it . 
point : there be no reasonable chance of success for the opposition movement absent substantial military re enforcement by the west . 
counterpoint : although it be true that bashar al assad have very strong entrenched power of control in syria , there be less risky and damaging way to undermine this to help support the domestic opposition movement if this be your aim . the crux of this case come down to the capacity of the government to outspend the opposition movement , international sanction and freezing of state and personal asset of high rank leader in syria combine with funding of the opposition movement in syria would gain this same end without involve western troop on the ground .
