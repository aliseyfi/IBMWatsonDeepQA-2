point : israel s security wall be a breach of international law . the international court of justice icj in the hague be ask by the united nations general assembly to consider the legality of the barrier and , in july 2004 , it rule that the security wall be a breach of international law . 1 specifically , it find that the fourth geneva convention and international human right convention do apply in the occupied territories . the security wall breach the geneva convention because it assist illegal settlement and it building injured private property owner . 
counterpoint : the opinion of the icj be advisory and , therefore , largely symbolic . in this case the court be ask by the general assembly to comment on a resolution which be already anti israel , so the form of the request prejudge the decision . it be shameful that the icj have allow itself to be capture politically in this way . moreover , israel do not acknowledge the automatic jurisdiction of the icj and be therefore not bind to implement it ruling . the occupied territories be never part of a recognised state , and so the various international convention do not apply there . 
point : any short term security gain will be offset by grow palestinian resentment against israel , which could result in a great number of suicide attack in israel . israelis and palestinians will need to learn to live side by side ; build an eight metre high wall send a clear message to palestinians that israel be hostile and unwilling to find a permanent solution that would suit both nation . when construct the barrier through jerusalem for example the wall split community , disrupts everyday life and declare that a shared sovereignty solution be no longer possible for the city both side claim a their capital . when people s life be disrupt by something that they feel be unnecessary and discriminatory it be bind to increase resentment . in this case it be make worse by the barrier be sit on land the palestinians consider theirs . it should therefore be no surprise if more palestinians turn to the only way they see that they get any response from israel violence . it would be hard to find a good way to radicalise the inhabitant of east jerusalem . 
counterpoint : israel have a legitimate right to self defence and the protection of it people . the barrier be intend to prevent palestinian suicide bomber from cross into israel . before the barrier be in place , 900 israelis die in such attack . 1 if there be no terror threat , there would be no need for a barrier . since the construction of the security wall , it have be much more difficult for palestinian terrorist group to mount suicide attack in israel . for more than three year , no palestinian terrorist have be able to get through the barrier to attack civilian . 2 a security measure which have save the life of countless innocent people demand our support and should be complete as soon a possible . east jerusalem during the second intifada be relatively quiet precisely because it be cut off from the rest of the west bank and the movement of the resident be restrict . 3 
point : the security wall could weaken the palestinian position at any peace negotiation , a it affect the fact on the ground which in turn impact negotiation . creating the barrier essentially unilaterally annexes land to israel from the west bank a that land be no longer accessible from the west bank but be accessible with no restriction from israel . many of these area that be be annex be be annex precisely because they include the israeli settlement that have be build up in the west bank so this land be be occupy by israeli citizen who be have infrastructure build for them . the more this happen the more difficult it will be for israel to give the land back later . israel will rightly be able to claim that if only israelis live within the barrier why should they give that land back a a majority of the population would be against it ? 
counterpoint : the security barrier be only temporary and , therefore , will not affect any peace negotiation . israel have make clear that it expect any border settlement to be negotiate with the palestinians . the barrier will be move or dismantle should there be a final agreement between israel and the palestinians . such an agreement will never take place , however , without proper security for israelis . in this way , israel s security barrier will actually bring a full peace settlement closer . 
point : israel s security wall effectively annexes palestinian territory . palestinian leader assert that the route chosen could lead to almost half of the cultivatable land in the west bank be annex . 1 this obviously reduce the viability of any eventual palestinian state a it will need to rely more on import food . most western government have criticise the barrier because part of it route departs from the so called green line , israel's pre 1967 boundary and the internationally recognised border . 2 the route be not base on security consideration , but be clearly political , concern to tie the land around israeli settlement to israel . it also violate property right , a thousand of acre of land have be take away from palestinian owner in order to build the wall and the wide strip of access track beside it . this be clearly wrong and a barrier that keep to the 1967 border would have allow the palestinians a viable future state while also provide security for israel . 
counterpoint : the security barrier merely connect israeli settlement in the west bank . civilians in the west bank settlement deserve a much protection against terrorist attack a anyone else . while the estimate that half of the west bank could be annex be blow out of proportion , israel acknowledge that the barrier do sometimes depart from the green line and therefore include part of the so called palestinian territory . yet the fence be not political a former israeli defence minister benjamin ben eliezer put it . 1 its exact route have be dictate only by security consideration , for example the need to prevent sniper have a clear line of sight on road use by israeli settler .
