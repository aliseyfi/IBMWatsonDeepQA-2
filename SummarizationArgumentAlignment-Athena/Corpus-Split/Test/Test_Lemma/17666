point : other civic duty also exist which be recognise a necessary in order to live in a good , more cohesive , stable society 1 like pay tax , attend school , obey road rule and , in some country , military conscription and jury duty . all of these obligatory activity require far more time and effort than voting do , thus compulsory voting can be see a constitute a much small intrusion of freedom than any of these other activity . 
counterpoint : a democracy be base on the principle of respect basic human right , such a free choice . this principle be directly violate by compulsory voting . with many civil right there be a choice to choose to engage in the activity or not . voting have carry that option , citizen of a democracy have the choice to either vote or not , despite be encourage to vote . it do not matter why a person choose to vote or not , it be the fact of principle that they have the right to choose . compulsory voting go against such idea of the freedom of choice , and on that ground should not be compulsory . 
point : voter apathy be high among the poor and most excluded sector of society . as the institute for public policy research 5 highlight , the high the income a citizen enjoy , and the high the educational qualification attain , the more likely it be that he or she will turn out to vote . since they do not vote , the political party do not create policy for their need , which lead to a vicious circle of increase isolation . by make the most disenfranchised vote the major political party be force to take notice of them and this would reduce political polarisation 1 . an example of this be in the uk where the labour party abandon it core supporter to pursue middle england . political party be draw towards those group to whom favourable policy will be reward in the form of vote . compulsory voting ensures that all stakeholder in society be proportionally consider in governmental policy . 
counterpoint : this idea be nonsense . political party do try and capture the disadvantaged group vote , specifically in order to convince them that voting be in their best interest . as oppose to compulsory voting , a voluntary system in fact encourages political party to target policy at the disadvantage in order to convince them to get out and vote , rather than accept that the disadvantaged will simply vote for the opposition . the labour party shift to the right in the uk specifically because no one be vote for it ; the majority of the population , from across the social spectrum , no longer believe in it socialist agenda and it alter it policy to be more in line with the majority of the population . low turnout be best cure by more education , for example , civics class could be introduce at school . in addition , the inclusion of these less interested voter will increase the influence of spin a presentation become more important . it will far trivialise politics and bury the issue under a pile of hype . another alternative could be reform the voting system of the individual country to better accommodate it population . 
point : compulsory voting increase the number of people who cast their vote 1 . people who know they will have to vote will take politics more seriously and start to take a more active role . compulsory voting will potentially encourage voter to research the candidates' political position more thoroughly . this may force candidate to be more open and transparent about their position on many complex and controversial issue . citizens will be willing to inform themselves even about unpopular policy and burn issue that need to be tackle . better inform voter will , therefore , oppose a plan that be unrealistic or would present an unnecessary budget drain . this mean that such a system could produce good political decision that be not contradict each other , quite upon the contrary . 
counterpoint : forcing the population to vote will not stop people express their wish not to vote . tucker note that in australia 5 of eligible voter do not caste a valid vote . most country that use compulsory voting give voter a legal opportunity to abstain . for example , in australia valid explanation might include be overseas , try to vote but fail for some reason , or belong to a religious order which prohibit vote electoral commission 8 . moreover people who vehemently refuse to vote find a way to do so such a pay the fine straight away for those who can afford to or attend the polling station but submit a blank ballot . mcallister et al 1992 1 conclude that compulsory voting have lead to a high level of non vote because the only legal method of political protest be to spoil the ballot paper or leave it blank deliberately 2 . however , in non compulsory jurisdiction voter so motivate would boycott the ballot . 
point : australia be one of the most notable example of compulsory voting and show how it can be implement . in australia compulsory voting be introduce at federal election in 1924 1 . every australian citizen who be over eighteen have to vote unless they have a valid and sufficient reason for fail to vote which be decide by the electoral commission whether a reason be sufficient 2 . if the elector who fail to vote do not provide such a reason they pay a penalty and if s he do not pay then the matter be deal with in court 3 . there be little reason to believe that this would be more difficult to implement in any other country . 1 evans , tim , 'compulsory voting in australia' , australian electoral commission , january 2006 , access 4 8 11 10 2 harrison , brianna , and lynch , philip . votes for the homeless , march 2003 , access 4 8 11 11 3 voter turnout for referendums and elections 1901 12 , australian electoral commission , 2010 
counterpoint : that it have be implement successfully in australia do not mean that compulsory voting will work everywhere . australia have a small population so the system do not have to be as bureaucratic a it would be in a much big nation . moreover australia have a law abide culture and fast and efficient court so most people will vote even if they object to it be compulsory . in a country with either a slow court system or a population that be less inclined to follow the law the number of case of fail to vote face the court could be overwhelm . 
point : a benefit of compulsory voting be that it make it more difficult for special interest group to vote themselves into power . under a non compulsory voting system , if few people vote then it be easy for small sectional interest and lobby group to control the outcome of the political process . a notable example would be the disproportionate influence of agriculture in policy making a see in both european politics and well a american with enormous amount of subsidy for farmer who represent a minute percentage of the population . 1 2 
counterpoint : the power of lobby group be a benefit to politics at large . their ability to publicize issue that be important to specific interest group be invaluable to the political process . similarly , they be able to propel and sustain wide interest in the political agenda , ensure oversight over public policy and recommend necessary change . to reduce their power in favour of less interested voter will increase the influence of spin a presentation , not substance , become more important . it will far trivialise politics and bury the issue under a pile of hype . furthermore , by remove incentive for political party to mobilise their support , compulsory voting favour establish party over minor party and independent , whose supporter tend to be more inherently motivate .
