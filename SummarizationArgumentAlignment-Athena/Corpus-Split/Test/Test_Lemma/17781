point : states can legally acquire the capacity to build a nuclear bomb and then withdraw from the treaty . the essential problem be that uranium and plutonium be use a fuel for both nuclear reactor and nuclear bomb . the process by which these material be manufactured uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing be permit because they have legitimate application in civilian nuclear program . on it website it be state : the iaea verifies through it inspection system that states comply with their commitment , under the non proliferation treaty and other non proliferation agreement , to use nuclear material and facility only for peaceful purpose . 1 providing a state 'plays along' with the iaea and allow inspection , it can legally acquire these technology . then , once it be in a position to produce material suitable for use in a weapon , it can simply leave the npt . all a state then have to do to leave the npt be give 6 month notice ; the iaea be then left powerless . indeed , this be precisely what north korea do , and what it be fear that iran will do . north korea be know to have reprocess technology and it probably have an enrichment capability too . in 2003 it withdraw from the npt follow the breakdown of an agreement with the us place it facility out of the reach of the iaea . although international law have succeed in prevent proliferation in some case , it 'optional' nature mean that to be truly effective it must sometimes be bolster by american unilateral action . 
counterpoint : it be not a loophole to allow state to use nuclear technology for peaceful purpose . many state have energy supply problem and nuclear be often a necessary part of the energy mix . it may be true that the iaea do not move as quickly a the usa would like but there be advantage to it careful , meticulous approach . first , this approach ensure that the iaea do not make false accusation . as the united states find out recently in iraq , assess the state of a wmd program be a tricky exercise and mistake can be costly . second , the iaea's approach allow for a gradual build up of international pressure . it be unrealistic to expect immediate agreement from the entire international community about the need to deal with a potential proliferator . by carefully acquire and present evidence the iaea can gradually build up international support . this process also lead to an increase of pressure on the potential proliferator and hence the chance of a peaceful solution . 
point : the iaea's approach to non proliferation monitoring nuclear facility focus , almost entirely , on what be know a the demand side . america can supplement this with a counter proliferation strategy that focus on prevent supply . a us lead coalition have , for example , start the proliferation security initiative psi 1 . states within the psi have agree to share intelligence about unlawful shipment of nuclear material and then intercept these cargo at sea . this strategy enable the us to prevent proliferation to organization which be outside of the iaea's reach , namely terrorist organization and state which be not party to , or ignore , the npt . although exact detail be keep secret , a number of illegal shipment have be stop and seize under psi . a second example of america's supply side approach be the proposal to stop the spread of reprocess and enrichment . 2 clearly , prevent potential proliferators from buy the technology to produce nuclear weapon in the first place be a more effective strategy than monitor it once it be in the hand of state which may abuse it . 
counterpoint : the us strategy of prevent proliferation on the supply side be flaw for two reason : it doesn't work and simultaneously undermines more effective demand side effort . america's attempt to halt the spread of reprocess and enrichment be doom to failure because it cannot convince other nation to do the same . in 2004 president bush approach the nuclear suppliers group nsg and ask it member state not to export reprocess and enrichment facility to state which do already possess them . the nsg refuse , effectively ruin the president's plan without the support of every nation that already these technology he cannot hope to prevent their further spread . however , even if he have get the agreement of the nuclear suppliers group , there would still be the problem of prevent state from develop this technology themselves without help . 
point : unlike the iaea , the usa be able to take fast , decisive action against a potential proliferator . in contrast , the united states can act quickly and decisively . quickly because there be usually consensus between the president and congress about proliferation issue . decisively because of the massive diplomatic , economic and , in extreme case , military power at the usa's disposal . this power can not only be use to stop a potential proliferator in it track but be also an effective deterrent to state try to go nuclear . in an example , the us be able to take decisive action in kosovo when the rest of the world be deal with bureaucracy , instead of help the people there . 
counterpoint : apart from the lack of check and balance associate with us unilateral action , the threat of such action be unlikely to prevent proliferation . rather it will encourage other state to try and acquire nuclear weapon a a counterweight to the us . those state that be currently in the process of acquire nuclear weapon iran and north korea be do so precisely because they be the only effective mean of deter us conventional power . were the usa to stop act outside of the iaea , international effort to curb iranian and north korean weapon program would likely be much more effective .
