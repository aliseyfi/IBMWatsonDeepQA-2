point : the concept of parenthood in the context of donor assist conception be complicate . is someone who donate an egg or some sperm really a parent ? shouldn't parent mean the one who care for you a a baby , get up in the night for you , saw you through teethe and childhood illness , and work hard to give you food , shelter and the best life they be able to provide ? in the case of child seek the mother who give them up for adoption , this be permissible specifically because of the relationship build up during pregnancy and birth1 . in the case of sperm donor , 'whether for money or out of altruism , the father have go into a cubicle and masturbate into a container . there be a difference'1 . as such , give that donor never actually meet or speak to the real parent or the actual child , the situation be not at all like adoption or even surrogacy . it be more like blood donation , and therefore give the recipient no right over the donor . 1 berlins , m . 2006 , april 5 . children's right to find their sperm donor father . retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from the guardian 1 
counterpoint : sperm and egg donor be biological , and therefore the only objectively true , parent . therefore , they have to accept that a child conceive use their material assume 50 of their dna , and inevitably thereafter will be link to them . donors who enter into the process must therefore accept that child be naturally go to be curious about where half of themselves originate . as olivia merricks , who use a sperm donor to have her daughter zannah , argue , 'i think people should only be donor if they understand that need to know more about yourself'1 . nowhere else in the law be child deny the right to know who their parent be if the information be available . this reflect the widely hold , and very natural , notion that learn about yourself be one of the fundamental driving force of life . we ask our parent question not just to know about their life , but to understand how we come to be . it be to our parent that we direct such question specifically because we share their gene . as such , donor cannot deny they be true parent . 
point : few would be sperm or egg donor wish to be know to any child result from their donation . removing anonymity be therefore a major deterrent , especially a in most country little money be pay for sperm donation more be pay for egg because the procedure be much more intrusive and unpleasant for a female donor . it be widely predict that remove anonymity in the uk would result in a fall in donation , and this have in fact happen for both egg and sperm despite government claim that sperm donor have increase , the number of actual donation have crucially go down . as the times report , the number of woman treat with donated sperm fell by 20 per cent in the first year anonymity be lift , reflect the reduced number of sperm donation 1 . egg treatment be similarly down , by 40 , a catastrophic drop accord to a british member of parliament 1 . if the donor name be to appear on the actual birth certificate of any child , it be obvious that even few people will be prepare to donate . given the desperation of infertile couple seek assistance with conception , and the long waiting list for both egg and sperm , the predictable consequence of this policy be both lamentable and cruel . 
counterpoint : removing donor anonymity do not deter donor population overall , but it do alter the composition of the donor population . instead of young single men who do not have child , it tend to be old men , who do have child and who see that what they be do be create a family , who come forward'1 . for example , in sweden , where anonymity have be lift , after an initial fall , the profile change in just this manner1 . furthermore , the uk policy of remove anonymity have also not affect the number of sperm donor negatively . the number have fall for three year lead up to 2005 , when anonymity be lift , but increase somewhat in the two year follow , with a 6 rise in the number of donors2 . the number of egg donor be down somewhat , but the reason for this have much more to do with wide issue of publicity and incentive than with anonymity . 1 bbc news . 2005 , march 31 . sperm donor anonymity end . retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from bbc news : 4 2 hfea . 2007 , may 3 . number of sperm donor up follow anonymity law change . retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from human fertilisation embryology authority : 5 
point : because lift anonymity make it so much more difficult to conceive a child through the government's regulate health care system , desperate couple will be drive to look for alternative . estimates suggest that , in the uk where anonymity have be lift , one in seven couple have fertility problems1 . however , with long wait for donor expect after the policy change , many be increasingly turn to riskier , unregulated option . women will be tempt to seek sperm informally from male friend the do it yourself turkey baster approach , which can cause friction among friendship group . couples will also go abroad a fertility tourist , seek egg and sperm in country where donor can still remain anonymous2 . such consequence be clearly bad for everyone , be unregulated , often emotionally messy , and possibly even dangerous . the evidence from sweden also suggest that it be now much less likely that parent will be honest with their child about their origin , defeat the whole point of the policy3 . 1 bbc news . 2005 , march 31 . sperm donor anonymity end . retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from bbc news : 4 2 henderson , m . 2008 , june 26 . childless couple deny a anonymity loss scar egg and sperm donor . retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from the times : 6 3 bbc news . 2004 , january 18 . sperm donor 'to lose anonymity' . retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from bbc news : 7 
counterpoint : a reduction in the number of donor will not force couple overseas . firstly , most couple will trust their own health system much more than foreign one with few safeguard , so they win t want to go abroad . secondly , seek a donor abroad be a much more expensive business ; whilst a british donor be pay just 250 pound compensation , a spanish donor will receive up to 900 . the extra cost be pass on to the donor seek couple 1 . as such , most people be simply unable to go overseas , even if they felt they have a good chance of conception by do so . 
point : sperm and egg donor have a right to remain anonymous . having go out of their way to provide a mean for a couple to have the child they otherwise could not have have , they deserve their wish to be respect in return . the unveiling of their identity and , likely , contact from the child would cause psychological harm at least equal to that of the offspring1 . there should be no hierarchy regard whose right be more important , disclosure should only be permit if both party be happy to do so . in the united states , for example , when sign up with donor bank , donor be able to 'make it clear' they don't want to be find by sign a waiver of anonymity2 . if donor wish to sign that form and retain their privacy , that right should not be take from them , regardless of the child's wish . donors should be entitle to move on with their life and not fear be track by offspring they neither ask for , nor wanted3 . 1 berlins , m . 2006 , april 5 . children's right to find their sperm donor father . retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from the guardian 1 2 lehmann haupt , r . 2010 , march 1 . anonymous anymore ? retrieved july 13 , 2011 , from slate : 8 3 essig , t . 2011 , june 30 . balancing the rights of donor offspring with those of donors : but what about parents ? retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from forbes : 9 
counterpoint : the right to privacy of a sperm or egg donor be less fundamental than that of the child's right to know , therefore the donor's desire for anonymity be override by the child's desire to know who their actual parent are1 . to deny to a child the name of one of their parent , when it be available and on record , be to discriminate between child base on whether they be conceive naturally or not . many parent , if give a choice , would choose to remain anonymous after one night stand , or accidental pregnancy , however since they be give no right to privacy , why be it that grant to donor ? what be share between both case be the superiority of the child's right and an understanding that regardless of the circumstance in which they be conceive , they deserve an equality of right which remain paramount . one of those right be the right to know who their biological parent be . 1 the economist . 2007 , august 2 . misconceived . retrieved july 6 , 2011 , from the economist : 10
