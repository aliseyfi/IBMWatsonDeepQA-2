point : the nation state be the fundamental building block of the international system , and be recognize a such in all international treaty and organization mearsheimer , 1993 . states be recognize a have the right to defend themselves , and this right must extend to the possession of a strategic national missile defense system . the united states have every right to develop such a system if it will furnish a great measure of defense for it citizen and interest . us military technology be the most advanced and prodigiously finance in the world , which be why it be generally the united states that stand at the forefront of new defense and combat system . the national missile defense program be simply the new tool in the arsenal of the world s great military , whose purpose be entirely defensive . to shield itself from potential ballistic missile , and even nuclear , attack the united states have the right to build a missile shield to defend itself and it ally under it aegis . there be no principled justification for a country to not pursue defense initiative that benefit itself and that it wish to pursue . 
counterpoint : it be not always within the right of a state to develop weapon and technology , since international treaty ban , for example , the development of chemical and nuclear weapon . furthermore , when the development of weapon will be detrimental to the state that build them , it be in their interest no to do so . in the case of national missile defense , the united states be anger several country , particularly russia , and potentially upset the balance of mutually assure destruction harding , 2007 . clearly more than a right to self defense must be consider when develop new kind of armament . 
point : the missile defense shield the united states intend to build be the most effective and complete ballistic missile shield ever devise . when fully arm with a complement of anti ballistic missile both within the united states itself , and in allied nation in europe , the shield will be virtually impregnable to external missile attack . this mean the chance of a nuclear attack succeed against it will be very unlikely , reduce the chance not only of a full scale nuclear war between the united states and another nuclear power , but also against missile fire by rogue state or terrorist , the big threat in term of actual use of nuclear weapon the economist , 2009 . technologically speak , anti ballistic missile missile have develop by leap and bound in recent year . the current system be put into operation by the united states be the aegis combat system , design for deployment on us naval vessel . this new development have serve to sidestep the problem associate with ground and space base missile defense array , due to the slow response time of ground missile , and the still unfeasible orbital deployment . the sea base defense array , furthermore , lack the problem of the land base system in that it do not need to be place in country other than the united states in order to be effective thus avoid the political problem of the past . technology and diplomacy have clearly make a national missile defense system highly desirable . 
counterpoint : anti ballistic missile system be a largely unproven technology , and still have many problem that do not make them a viable option for strategic defense , at least not at present . furthermore , there be the excessively high cost of design and building such a system , which have be in development for 25 year . it have cost billion of dollar over the decade , include 53 billion between 2004 and 2009 , the large single line on the pentagon s budget for those year . for all this , only an unproven system of questionable efficacy have be produce . it would be good to stop throw good money after bad try to develop a technology that may never be useful . also , even if the technology be make effective , the same technology could be use a a countermeasure by enemy country against the interception of their missile , make the system even less effective , if not useless sessler , et al . , 2000 . furthermore , the system do not protect the vital interest of the united states because it anger country like russia , which have actually begin increase it conventional force distribution on it western border with the rest of europe , and to threaten to deploy short range nuclear missile on it border . the political destabilization cause by the missile defense program be not worth it ephemeral benefit . 
point : with a fully function missile defense shield deploy , nuclear arm ballistic missile become obsolete , unable to ever reach their target . this mean country strategic obsession with second strike capacity , the ability to return fire with nuclear weapon should they be attack by them mutually assured destruction , will cease to be an issue , a first strike be destine to be wipe out before they hit a single target . what this mean be that country with missile defense system can feel secure without the need of retain massive nuclear arsenal . this will alleviate the pressure to have stockpile of warhead and will promote disarmament . mutually assured destruction have become a far less secure strategy a nuclear proliferation have occur to state with different strategic conception . this have be see in the united states , which since it full adoption of the aegis system have actively pursue a policy of reach a new accord with russia on nuclear arm reduction . this culminate in 2010 with the signing of the new start strategic arms reduction treaty , an accord to reduce the number of strategic nuclear missile launcher by half associated press , 2011 . this new step toward nuclear disarmament could not be politically possible in the united states without a replacement defense , which only a national missile defense system can provide . 
counterpoint : nuclear capability have historically create more stable international relation between country , a describe in the doctrine of mutually assured destruction mad . the united states and russia never engage one another in open conflict during the whole span of the cold war , for example , for fear of set off a nuclear cataclysm neither could survive waltz , 1981 . mad break down , however , with the advent of national missile defense system . this be due to the fact that when a state cannot guarantee it second strike , or even first strike capability it become vulnerable . countries without missile defense system will be defenseless against those that have them . furthermore , a the technology be disseminate and more country possess missile defense system , stability decrease a it will become a gamble a to which country can more successfully counteract the offensive and defensive missile system of the enemy . missile defense make the world le , not more safe . 
point : an operational national missile defense system render nuclear weapon , and intercontinental ballistic missile generally , obsolete . when a country can shoot down all enemy missile , those weapon lose their power . the future of war , once country have access to the technology to build missile shield , will no longer be mark by finger hold over the proverbial red button . rather , the incentive for conflict between state arm with effective missile defense will be to seek diplomatic solution to problem . the technology will likely be in the hand of many nation very soon , a the united states have already provide the technology to japan and australia , and will be build defense battery in romania from 2015 mcmichael , 2009 . furthermore , even should war break out , they will necessarily be far less destructive , a they will not feature the city level power of nuclear missile . with missile defense , war will be less likely and , should it occur , less destructive . 
counterpoint : conventional war be a nasty thing , and can be just as destructive a nuclear war , if not a immediate . the threat of war be only increase with the break down of mad , a country will be able to engage one another without fear of the existential threat of nuclear holocaust . furthermore , if many country have access to missile defense system they will likely be able to employ countermeasure against their enemy system , bring the chance of nuclear weapon deployment back to the fore .
