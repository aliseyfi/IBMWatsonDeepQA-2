point : if it be logically possible for a necessary be i . e . god to exist , then it exist . whatever one clearly and distinctly to be contain in the idea of something be true of that thing . it be clearly and distinctly perceptible that necessary existence be contain in the idea of god . for this reason , god must exist1 . one cannot conceive of a god in any context other than one of existence . clearly , he must exist . 1 malcolm , n . 1960 . anselm's ontological arguments . philosophical review 69 . 
counterpoint : it be nonsensical to suppose that just because we can mentally visualize something akin to a god that it must exist . rather , it be clear that the visualization be nothing more than a fantasy until it can be demonstrate 1 . furthermore , it could be that everyone's visualization of god be not of the ultimate be , but only an approximation of the idea , mean that perhaps the very notion be impossible to conceive at all . 1 : holt , tim . 2008 . hume on a priori existential proofs . philosophy of religion . 3 
point : people all over the world believe in god . they believe that a high power watch over them and guide them , and that they will be reward when they die for live good life on earth 1 . religion of some kind be a constant in virtually every culture , and there be evidence of religious practice almost a far back a we have evidence for humanity . faith be it own proof , and the willingness of people to make tremendous sacrifice for their belief , even die for them , demonstrate that they must believe in something that be real . 1 swinburne , richard . 1997 . is there a god ? . oxford : oxford university press . 
counterpoint : believing in something do not make it real . people once believe that the world be flat , but their belief do not make it so . faith without reason be ignorance . furthermore , many people believe in different deity , and many religion have come into and go out of existence throughout the age . these religion be often contradictory , and yet their adherent believe them fervently . at best only one of the group can be wholly right , mean the others belief be unfounded . it be more likely that all the belief be untrue . 
point : nature be mark by clear design . the complexity of the human body , of planet , star , and galaxy , and even of bacteria attests to the existence of creative agency . it be impossible that such thing a interdependent specie could come to exist without the guidance of god 1 . likewise , certain organism can be show to be irreducibly complex , meaning that if one be to remove any part of such an organism , it could not function . this refute the gradualist argument of evolution , since there be no selective pressure on the organism to change when it be functionless . for example , the bacterial flagellum , the motor that power bacterial cell , lose all functionality if a single component be remove 2 . besides design , the only explanation of it development be blind chance , which seem less sensible , since in human experience nothing complex can come about without agency . 
counterpoint : there be no design in the universe . people tend to anthropomorphize their environment , try to assign human like quality to animal and nature . all of the complexity in the universe can be attribute to natural process ; the universe , star , and life be all the product of physical and chemical interaction . there be no mystery in the basic process . furthermore , there be no irreducibly complex organism . every example offer by theist of irreducible complexity have be find inaccurate . the bacterial flagellum , for example , when several key component be remove lose it functionality a a motor , but become a form of secretory system that have a separate function1 . clearly , complexity be not indicative of a creator . 1 miller , kenneth . 2004 . the flagellum unspun : the collapse of 'irreducible complexity' in ruse , michael and william dembski ed . . debating design : from darwin to dna . cambridge : cambridge university press . 
point : throughout the age many people have claim that they have observe and speak with god . all the major religion of the world speak of individual who have walk with god and derive divine insight . these prophet be the author and subject of many holy book , such a the bible and the qur an . the revelation provide in these book can only be the work of god 1 . god s commandment to act morally , god s philosophical wisdom , be record for any doubter to see . 
counterpoint : virtually every holy book be full of error . they be often write long after the fact from second and third hand account of the exploit of their subject . this lead to the development of embellishment and legend , with the supernatural element of story always begin to take precedence once all actual witness to event have die . ancient holy book be nothing more than the moral framework of the time in which they be write . they be not transcendent in their wisdom , but very much a part of their time . this be why many of the moral sentiment express in such text a the bible be not practice in western state any longer , because to do so would now be consider morally repugnant . no one in europe would consider it acceptable , for example , to stone someone to death for work on the sabbath . moral sentiment clearly evolve over time1 . holy book and prophet show no divine wisdom , which would have to transcend the time of writing and be applicable always . 1 mcginn , c . 1979 . evolution , animals , and the basis of morality . inquiry 22 : 92 98 . 
point : the probability of life begin on earth be tiny . the chemical composition of the planet have to be perfect for the development of life , a do it position of orbit around the sun , since if it have be slightly far away it would have be too cold for life to develop , while it if have be slightly closer , it would have be too hot . furthermore , the evolution of human being , with free will and intelligence , be even less likely . had the universal constant e . g . gravity , strong and weak force be different , the universe would have be very different , and might well have be unable to sustain life 1 . only through design could the universe possibly be the way it be , conducive to life on earth . 
counterpoint : the fact that our planet support life seem remarkable to u only because we be here to observe it . there be many other planet which do not support life ; we just happen to live on one on which the condition be conducive to life . we do not need to appeal to a divine designer to explain this .
