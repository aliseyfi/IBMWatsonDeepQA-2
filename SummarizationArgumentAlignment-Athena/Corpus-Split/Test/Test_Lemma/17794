point : feminism be still of relevance today , and be indeed need . in the uk , one in four woman suffers domestic violence , and an increase in the reporting of rape in the last thirty year have go alongside a threefold drop in conviction rate . in country such a ireland and malta abortion be still not legal for all woman , this can be see a an important part of equality for woman that have not be achieve yet and need to be fight for . if we take feminism a a global movement then the movement be still of huge importance . that's because u . s . woman still earn only 77 cent on the male dollar in 2008 , accord to the late census statistic . that number drop to 68 for african american woman and 58 for latinas . 1 these be all real problem , on which feminist continue to campaign a they should . 
counterpoint : feminism have no more battle leave to fight . victories such a gain the vote , the right to an abortion in most of the northern hemisphere and the right to equal pay be important and worth winning . but give that sexual equality be now rightly enshrine and protect in law , there be nothing left for the feminist movement to do in most western country . it may still be useful in part of the world where woman still lack basic democratic and other right . however , in western society the feminist cause in no longer need . 
point : out of over 250 country , only a few be currently head by woman . 1 women still account for only about 14 of member of parliament worldwide in 2002 . 2 some argue that gender quota should be establish to ensure equal input of men and woman in parliament . therefore , the feminist movement be still need to fight this battle . 
counterpoint : the glass ceiling be extremely variable . the two deciding and overlap factor , be whether woman have child and which profession they be in . higher number of woman now go to university may change the number of lawyer , judge , doctor etc in the future . doctors , barrister , lead scientist , all now contain a significant female percentage . since 2001 there be more woman call to the bar than men . 1 huge advancement have be make and give positive intervention in the past statistic be now change . therefore , the feminist movement have achieve it objective . 
point : employers worry when they hire young middle age woman . they fear that after hire a woman , she will only cost the company money by get pregnant and go on maternity leave . to combat this attitude , maternity and paternity leave should be equal . currently , paternity leave be a maximum of two consecutive week . these two week must be take within 56 day of the child s birth . this can be contrast with the long maternity leave that be allow for . women be entitle to 52 week of maternity leave from day one of employment . women be entitle to maternity pay for 39 week if they have be work for their employer for 26 week . 
counterpoint : most corporation , in almost every country on the earth will not even offer their male employee something close to paternity . 1 but , most country mandate by law , that woman get a set amount of maternity leave . the truth be that , the lack of any kind of paternity leave for the male , indicate that there be a glass ceiling hovering over father head , and be prevent them from be good parent . it would benefit every family , if father be allow to spend time with their new born , like woman can .
