point : the united nations be a global body that must represent the whole world . just a democratic government need to remain representative to be legitimate so the same be true of intergovernmental organisation . if the uk and france hang on to their permanent seat forever , the unsc will lose it legitimacy , a the united nations will no longer be see to be representative . the result will be an increase risk of war and conflict because the world s major power have no legitimate share arena for discuss their interest . this be exactly what happen to the league of nations after world war i . as many of the most powerful nation , usa , ussr and germany be unwilling to join or bar from join the league never have much legitimacy . as a result the league be unable to prevent conflict in manchuria and abyssinia ethiopia eventually lead to world war ii . 1 since their interest in a stable world through the legitimacy of the unsc outweigh their interest in a formal veto power , france and the uk should be willing to give up their veto power . 
counterpoint : there be a good reason why previous attempt at reform the united nations security council have not succeed . reform have be attempt several time since 1992 when secretary general boutros ghali call for a renewal of the united nations by 1995 . 1 the g4 make up of germany , japan , brazil and india have be lobby to become permanent member but be oppose by others who want more non permanent seat . 2 kofi annan in 2005 suggest two option either 6 new permanent member with no veto or eight four year renewable term , 3 but this too have get nowhere . no matter who be on the council some country will feel aggrieved . if brazil become a member argentina and mexico will object , china might object to india become a permanent member and pakistan certainly would . 4 in africa it be not even certain who should represent the continent a there be no single leader , whoever be choose some country would not like the result . it be therefore good to leave thing how they be . the current unsc have be recognise a legitimate for more than sixty year this be not about to change . 
point : the permanent seat for france and the uk be base on the fact that they be among the great power and victor of world war ii . however , the global balance of power have shift significantly since then : france and the uk have decline ; britain s manufacture export drop from 25 of world manufacturing export in 1945 to 5 in 2000 . 1 and the uk be 6 . 52 of the world economy in 1950 2 but down to 3 . 56 in 2010 . 3 moreover both have large empire which be lose in the decade after 1945 . at the same time the eu have emerge a a major player in the international arena . the eu be one of the world s large trade bloc , have the world s large gdp , and represent almost half a billion people . a permanent seat for the eu would reflect those new power dimension . 
counterpoint : france and the uk might have decline in relative power since 1945 , but even today only japan and germany among non p5 state rank ahead of them economically . in any case , france and the uk be still amongst the world s foremost military power , with the world s large nuclear arsenal after the usa and russia , 1 and the world s high military expenditure after the usa and china with france spend 61 billion and the uk 57 billion in 2010 . 2 by contrast , the eu have no significant military to speak of , and be thus unable to project power across the globe . the eu launch a rapid reaction force mean to be 60 , 000 troop in 2001 , but it be still a paper tiger without even this many men and with many capability shortfall . 3 given the mission of the unsc to maintain international peace and security , eligibility for a permanent seat should be base on military power , not just economic or demographic power . 
point : the eu might function a an economic union , but it original goal be to prevent war from ever happen again on the european continent . the political resolution of the congress of europe in 1948 say it be the urgent duty of the nation of europe to create an economic and political union in order to assure security and social progress the creation of a united europe be an essential element in the creation of a united world . 1 the economic integration be a mean to this goal , by make member state economically too dependent on each other for them to want to declare war on each other . given this history , the eu can contribute a lot of knowledge and experience on how to use soft power in a foreign policy context . europe have be successful in create peace on a previously warlike continent . it have also have success in encourage reform in the country of eastern europe and be continue to do so in the balkans through enlargement . 2 croatia be at war with it neighbor fifteen year ago and part of yugoslavia twenty year ago but will become the 28th member of the eu in 2013 . 3 
counterpoint : the european union might be an economic powerhouse and might want to coordinate foreign relation in regard to external economic policy , but at heart it be intend to be an economic union , not a political union . most of it founding treaty and the daily working of it institution focus on create and maintain a single market , not on create a share foreign and military policy . giving the eu representation at what be an institution for foreign and military policy be misread what the eu be intend to be . 
point : in the past the european union have not have the necessary foreign policy bureaucracy and decision making capability to be able to control a unsc seat . since the lisbon treaty this have change . the treaty create a president of the european council , currently herman van rompuy . 1 and a european external action service eeas which will eventually have a staff of 5 , 400 . the eeas be a functionally autonomous eu body with a large number of embassy around the world . 2 this will give the eu representation in most country , 54 with ambassador out of a total of 136 , 3 and the ability to coordinate a foreign policy . a seat at the united nations security council would be a natural extension of this . 
counterpoint : europe may now have a president but a he have few independent power the lisbon treaty have not answer kissinger s apocryphal question who do i call if i want to dial europe . 1 the us president or secretary of state would still need to call round the major capital of europe a van rompuy would need to get the agreement of the prime ministers and presidents of the continent before he could do anything . 
point : the most practical way to reform the united nations be for france and britain to give way to a european union seat . although there would inevitably be some loss of influence for both nation the pain would be minimise by retain one seat between them . the european union often decide what country get what job base upon internal politics , so for example catherine ashton become high representative for foreign and security policy because tony blair do not get the presidency . 1 it would therefore be possible through an internal agreement in the european union to make sure that france and the united kingdom retain control of the unsc seat through have control of the foreign minister post and the post of ambassador to the united nations . 
counterpoint : even if unsc reform be perfectly logical in theory , in practice they would never work . the uk and france have a veto in the unsc , which mean they can halt any kind of reform of the unsc which be not in their interest . losing a permanent seat without get a clear benefit in return be definitely against their interest . even if they be to retain control over foreign policy no nation would want to move from have sole control of a seat to have to negotiate with it partner which way it will vote . as such the uk and france would veto any such proposal .
