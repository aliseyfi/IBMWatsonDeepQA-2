point : ransom payment be mean to end , and when utilize by criminal organization , those end be similarly criminal . stop pay ransom , and the fund for criminal activity will dry up . when the african union ban the practice in 2009 , algeria argue one of it primary motivation be prevent the like of al qaeda 'using ransom it receive in neighbour country to finance attack on security force inside algeria'1 . in the philippines , police official have call for criminalization due to fear that ransom payment have allow abu sayyef , a militia link with al qaeda , to survive and finance deadly bomb attacks2 . 
counterpoint : even if ransom payment be use to finance other crime , why be payee therefore responsible for those crime ? the ransom be not pay so that these crime can be commit , but rather in order to ensure those held captive be return unharmed . families and captive themselves should not have to sacrifice their loved one or themselves in order to prevent some prospective future crime from occur . it be the responsibility of the police force to do that , victim of kidnapping should be able to use their own money to protect themselves , however selfish their motivation . 
point : in situation where police force be inadequate , it be even bad to incentivise ransom far by give kidnapper virtual certainty of payment a be the status quo in many area . it be this combination which underlie the epidemic nature of ransom in some part of the world . at least if payment be criminalise , potential kidnapper would know that a pay off would be less likely , and thus some would decide it be not worth the risk . this would allow police force to concentrate resource on the remain case where kidnapper be more determined . 
counterpoint : kidnappers would not be deter for police force would be in no position to concentrate resource once ransom payment be criminalise . if this law be to be anything other than dead letter , they would have to take rigorous step to monitor and investigate victim of ransom demand to ensure they do not make payment . this would be a highly damaging distraction in a situation where the full focus and resource of the police be need elsewhere . further , the knowledge that they would be under scrutiny would likely deter many victim of ransom demand from contact the police in the first place . this may make sometimes situations even more dangerous for victim of ransom . 
point : ransom payment should be criminalize and payee arrest if they be find to have pay a ransom . the police should retain a monopoly on all negotiation , both to ensure kidnapping be not materially reward and to improve their own effort to stop the practice . while not all kidnapping may end peacefully , if the police be aware of them all , it may only take a few lead in a few case to break a kidnapping ring and reduce the threat to society a a whole . furthermore , the involvement of police will drag out hostage negotiation , make the overall industry less profitable to kidnapper for whom time be money . the african union in 2009 adopt such a resolution , 'condemning the payment of ransom to terrorist group to secure the freedom of hostages'1 . 
counterpoint : the criminalization of ransom payment both leave the payee in a no win situation and overestimate the effect of such a policy on kidnapper . firstly , the very first demand of kidnapper be that the ransom payee do not contact the police , often at risk of the life of the kidnap victim . once more , it seem cruel to demand that individual take this significant risk . secondly , ransom case often occur precisely because there be a low chance of detection , or due to the untrustworthiness of local police and security force . it may be preferable for ransom victim to contact the police , but this be best achieve not by coercion , but by make the police a genuine and trustworthy asset in such case . in colombia , which have experience a decline in kidnap figure from it height in the mid 2000s , the success be attribute to a proactive policy use the military , rather than a reliance on a reactive police force1 . the belief that criminalize ransom payment will have any positive effect be myopic at best . 
point : bluntly , the payment of ransom be exactly what the criminal in question want . it aid them financially , and bring a swift conclusion to a risky situation . both of these factor greatly decrease the chance of their detection and capture . given the threat pose by such serious criminal it be more than reasonable for the state to prohibit an action such a ransom payment , which so greatly reward criminal behaviour . the potential reward of kidnapping have also lead to the practice spread across border . in 1999 , 92 of all kidnapping take place in just ten country ; by 2007 , the practice have spread to six more countries1 . so long a ransom continue to be pay , the practice will not stop spreading . 
counterpoint : ransom payment do reward criminal behaviour but they be the less evil . paying a ransom ensure both that the captive be release without harm and prevent the criminal from commit a more serious crime . furthermore , the criminal behaviour be not the 'fault' of the ransom payee , therefore the payee cannot be blame either for the kidnapping or any late crime . police remain responsible for prevent crime occur in the first place , regardless of the resource of the criminal . the spread of kidnapping a a practice therefore reflect the quality of the police force in those country , and cannot be blame on ransom payee . 
point : the payment of ransom have very real and serious practical harm for society . in addition to aid the non detection of such criminal , the payment greatly increase their ability to conduct such act in future . as many case of ransom take place within network of organised crime the funding from these payment can greatly increase the capability for further act of ransom and other crime in the future . in state like mexico , where up to forty per cent of the national population feel unsafe due to profligate kidnapping , more have to be do to discourage or capture kidnappers1 this provide solid ground for criminalise act which propagate such activity . society be not merely harm by fear for one's own safety , financial fear still exist over the extent of the somalian piracy epidemic . despite more than 80 million be pay to pirate in 2008 alone , ransom price continue to rise2 , 3 . with ship and cargo continually willing to pay , the cost may eventually be pass onto consumer . 
counterpoint : kidnappings would not cease if ransom stop be pay . kidnappings be also carry out a a mean of stoke fear within a population ; in which case , the murder of a kidnap victim will achieve that purpose just a easily . furthermore , the harm to society be arguably less if all ransom be pay and victim return . if the proposition's model be to be adopt , the number of victim kill would rise and citizen would be far more worried about the risk of kidnapping a a result .
