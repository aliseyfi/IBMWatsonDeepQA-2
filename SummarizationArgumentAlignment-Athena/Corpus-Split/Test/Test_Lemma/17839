point : discretion allow for both intentional and unintentional bias . the u . s . supreme court recently hear a case concern allege corruption when a west virginia judge rule in favor of a plaintiff that have donate over 3 million to the judge s election campaign . 1 though this case be not directly link to minimum sentence , it demonstrate that judicial corruption be an issue in the legal system today ; mandatory sentencing reduce the discretion that allow unethical judicial action . furthermore , judge may attempt to be impartial , but data show that human be incline to be more sympathetic towards particular group . for example , female defendant be less likely to receive a death sentence than male defendant , while defendant in general be seven time more likely to receive the death penalty if the victim be female ; scholar suggest that these disparity be cause by societal perception that woman need great protection rather than any actual difference in the severity of the crime . 2 thus even decision that seem impartial be often not . strict sentencing mandate be more likely to yield just decision because they be less vulnerable to individual bias . 
counterpoint : mandatory sentence do not eliminate undue discretion ; they merely shift the power from judge to prosecutor . prosecutors may decide whether or not to charge defendant for violation other than the main charge . for example , a prosecutor may add weapon possession to a charge for drug sale this additional count can drastically increase the defendant s sentence . in the united states , defendant often cooperate with prosecutor and provide information in order to avoid such hefty sentence . michael simmons explain , a cooperation departure be usually the only significant sentence factor over which a defendant have any control and because the average cooperation departure cut a defendant s sentence in half it be often a defendant s only hope for a reduced sentence . thus , it be not surprising that cooperation departure have fundamentally change federal prosecution . 1 prosecutors may wield this power to coerce defendant into accept a plea bargain in case where they might reasonably be acquit at trial . because prosecutor be part of the executive branch , they be more susceptible to political influence than federal judge , who be often appoint , not elect . thus for a balance of power , it be well to allow judge to have discretion . 
point : deterrence work through several mechanism ; likelihood of get catch , severity of punishment , and perceive public disapproval . mandatory minimum sentence increase the effectiveness of severity a a deterrent . if potential criminal know a mild sentence be possible , they be more likely to commit crime in the hope that they may charm a judge into sympathetically lower their sentence . by establish a set minimum punishment , a potential criminal with any knowledge of the penal code know that , if catch , he she will face a substantial punishment for his her crime . the pro need not demonstrate that every , or even a strong majority , of would be criminal will be deter by mandatory minimum sentence ; so long a the mandate have a reasonable deterrent effect , it will reduce crime and therefore improve the overall standard of living . 
counterpoint : minimum sentence have only a theoretical impact on crime rate ; in reality they make no difference . the pro make two major assumption ; first , that criminal have reasonably accurate perception of the legal code . second , the pro assume that harsh penalty have a psychological impact on potential criminal . interviews with convicted felon find that a mere 22 even think they know what the punishment would be . another 18 do not know at all , and more than a third report that they have not think about punishment at all at the time of the crime . 1 thus minimum sentence be not sufficiently well publicize to have a significant deterrent effect . furthermore , substantial evidence demonstrate that additional severity have a relatively small deterrent effect . criminals respond much more to the chance of get caught rather than the consequence that occur if they get catch ; if a criminal s chance of get catch be 10 , the deterrent effect be virtually zero . 2 thus mandatory sentence do not have a substantial deterrent effect . 
point : the negative side effect of minimum sentence guideline can be avoid via safety valve . the u . s . federal government introduce safety valve in 1994 ; mandatory sentencing be suspend if the defendant meet certain criterion , such a be a low level participant or have no prior criminal history . the safety valve allow flexibility so that low risk offender do not receive excessively harsh punishment . thus mandatory sentence guideline have enough flexibility to recognize varying circumstance , while retain enough rigidity to deliver consistent punishment . 
counterpoint : safety valve be simply a reflection of the problem with mandatory sentencing . safety valve be proof that the inflexibility of minimum sentence lead to injustice . safety valve be a step in the right direction , but be themselves an inflexible form of relief . for example , safety valve often do not apply if the defendant have a history of more than one very minor offense , such a pass a bad check . 1 the good way to reduce the injustice of mandatory minimum sentence would be to eliminate the system and allow judicial discretion . 
point : incapacitation be one of the 4 basic reason for punishment . mandatory minimum sentence keep criminal out of society for a long period of time than they might otherwise be in jail , thereby reduce their window of opportunity to commit crime . the criminal justice system be obligate to refrain from cruel or unusual punishment , but it main purpose be to protect society from law breaker through various mean of prevent and punish illegal activity . mandatory minimum sentence should be proportionate to the severity of the crime , thus satisfy the requirement of humane punishment . thus mandatory minimum sentencing be a just method of protect the public . 
counterpoint : imprisonment only yield the benefit of incapacitation if the offender be a likely threat to society . if the criminal that be give an extensive prison sentence be unlikely to commit another crime , then his her incapacitation do not actually protect society . studies within prison population demonstrate that most offender commit relatively little crime , while a core group commit a large portion of the crime . for example , a rand corporation survey find that half of all burglar commit few than six crime per year , while the top 10 commit over two hundred . 1 thus society be not particularly well serve when the bottom half of burglar face long prison sentence ; few burglary be avoid , and these criminal will now have more difficulty rejoin society . 
point : former supreme justice sandra day o connor once say , liberty find no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt . 1 without mandate , judge may have radically different idea of just sentence . michael simons give the example of mutt and jim two criminal of identical background who commit the same crime . judge lenient sentence mutt , while judge harsh sentence jeff . mutt might receive one day in prison while jeff receive a sentence of twenty five year . 2 while such an extreme be unlikely , it be noteworthy that the legal system emphasize the importance of consistency . consistent precedent be essential because citizen need to be able to make decision know the legal consequence of their action . mandatory sentence need not be overly harsh , but there should be some sort of rigidity to establish reliability in the legal system . 
counterpoint : judges be capable of deliver consistency . judges be trained professional and must demonstrate competence in order to be appoint they be unlikely to administer completely random sentence . in order to further reduce inconsistency , the con support government issue sentence guideline so that judge be aware of the precedent concern sentence for a particular crime , so long a these guideline be not compulsory . in the unusual occurrence that a judge administer an unjustly harsh sentence , defendant may appeal their case to a high court . thus judicial discretion be unlikely to result in widespread inconsistent sentencing .
