point : theft be take something from someone who be the rightful owner without their permission . it doesn t matter if the rightful owner keep an original version or not . if you be download music from an unofficial source , you be steal it : you can start listen to that song , without the permission of the original owner . the only way you can get the right to listen to that song be via a legal transaction from which the right owner can make a profit 
counterpoint : theft always involve a thief take something away for themselves with the result that the original owner can t use it anymore . for example , if i steal your bike , you can t use it anymore . and this be exactly why theft be wrong : you have something which you want to use , and now you can t anymore , simply because i take it . 
point : because the artist make the music , it be their property , in this case intellectual property . property mean that the owner artist have the right to ask something from you in exchange for you gain access to the music . this may be money . it may also be the requirement that you clearly recognize the artist s moral right to always be mention a the creator of that music . this be call the free exchange of value , and this be the most fundamental relationship in our free market economy . 
counterpoint : realistically speak , music be not even property for property to really be property , it need to be tangible something physical you can touch . 1 if it be tangible , it be easy to keep you from use it , whereas when it be intangible , i can t . what if you hear a song on the radio which stay in your head all day long because you like it so much ? in economic term , we call such a good non excludable . 2 
point : apart from the moral reason , there be also a simple societal reason why it be wrong to download music without permission . the reason be that musician have to eat , too . suppose you be an up and come young musician think about what to do with your future . you can either become a full time musician or take up a job . if you become a fulltime musician , you ll be do what you love . but at the same time , everyone will be download all your music for free , simply because they can . this mean that music win t be a good , stable source of income for you , and this mean you d rather take up a job . since you re not work on your music every day , your talent will be underdeveloped , and the little piece of music you do write , for example in the weekend , be not as good a they could have be . so , download music without permission will lead to fewer good musician . that s not only bad for the musician , but also for u : we ll have less good music to listen to . 
counterpoint : it s true that musician have to eat , too , but it s not true that download cut their income . most of the money spend on music go to record company , not to artist , from each retail cd sell the artist only get between 3 and 10 . 1 those record company have be keep musician on a leash for decade , pay them less than they could . they pay them enough to make sure they would remain fulltime musician , but not so much that they didn t bother to create new album . so if download music file mean record company miss out on some income , we shouldn t feel bad about it .
