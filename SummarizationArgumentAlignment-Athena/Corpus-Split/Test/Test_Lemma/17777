point : sex crime , typically define a crime of violence involve sex , be one of the bad kind of crime , damage it victim both physically and psychologically . for such a horrific crime , a suitable punishment be need . castration fit the bill perfectly . it have be show that for many sex offender , the crime be cause by both psychological and physical urge no rational counselling will prevent a repetition of the crime . thus castration do not only stop far crime by the offender one of the main purpose of any punishment , but it be a strong deterrent for prospective offender . furthermore , a douglas besharov argue , the sexual abuse and violence in prison merely heighten their propensity to commit further crime besharow , 1992 . castration a the punishment for sex offender suit both perpetrator and victim , provide an effective and specific punishment for a specific crime . 
counterpoint : castration be not a fitting punishment for any crime . 
point : castration will help the offender themselves , by free them from the urge that motivate them to re offend . court testimony have show that many sexual criminal would dearly like to be free of these urge , but cannot control their action , much like a heroin addict cannot control theirs . thus a chemical cure for these urge will free the offender . dr . martin holly , a lead sexologist in prague , admit none of the nearly 100 sex offender who have be physically castrate have commit further offense bilefsky , 2009 . dr . fred berlin , cite separate study , claim re offend rate drop below 15 when participant be chemically castrate spalding , 1997 . 
counterpoint : castration be an inadequate mean of free sex offender from the potential to re offend . even if castration be combine with a jail term , it be still a far cruder and less effective treatment than prolonged psychotherapy . chemical castration do not even begin to get at the psychological root of the offender , focus instead on a swift , easy solution to a problem that run far deep . dr . fred berlin , in the same source mention opposite , believe there be many sex offender for whom this be not go to be appropriate or useful spalding , 1997 . also , the proposition s argument place the legal emphasis on help the offender , and may give the appearance of be a soft touch on such people . 
point : castration will also help the widespread hysteria about the crime of a sexual nature . at the moment , there be a massive stigmatisation of sexual offender , with them be name and sham publicly for example , by the news of the world newspaper in britain in the summer of 2000 , and hound off their estate by mob a can be see from the event after the news of the world campaign . they be also subject to a large amount of violence in prison from other inmate . if castration be introduce , the public would know that these people be no longer a threat , and they would be allow to get on with their life . castration remove both the public stigmatisation and personal suffering of sexual offender , and should be embrace by the penal system . 
counterpoint : there would be no such benefit . the proposition have admit that witch hunt take place over sexual offender , and these be by definition not motivate by rational consideration . castration would not end public anxiety ; just a declare a mass murderer rehabilitate would not put his neighbour at ease . also , the prison violence , and indeed other violence , be not so much motivate by a fear of re offence a by the desire to punish far for the original crime . castration would not help under these circumstance . it be an unproven and unsubtle method that deserve no place in a modern penal system . 
point : the legislative and executive branch of the state be equip with the power to order sentence that best suit both the offender and society . for sex offender that be adjudge to be at risk of re offend no matter how long or harsh the prison sentence , castration should be order . sexual castration would only be order however for those offender whom it would almost certainly reduce the risk of re offending , for it attack the root , hormonal cause of their criminal activity . once administer , the offender could be assess and release if it be felt that his rehabilitation be complete and he be no further risk to society . 
counterpoint : the precedence establish by allow the state to order that an individual be subject to physical harm separate and short of death be a slippery slope to the infliction of harm on offender in other area of the law . if sex offender be to be castrate , why not follow the example of saudi arabia and cut off the hand of those convict of theft ? furthermore , capital punishment be still permit in many place because , inter alia , it solve the issue of re offending . castration however offer no such promise , it may remove part of the sexual drive of sex offender but that neither prevents their ability to commit sex crime , nor alter the psychological state of mind that may have lead them to their initial crime .
