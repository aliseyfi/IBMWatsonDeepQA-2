point : there be very difficult issue involve here ; student will not easily understand whether the prohibition on kill applies to the death penalty , war , assist suicide , and a number of other very sensitive public policy subject to intense debate . 1 likewise , the prohibition against adultery could be interpret a not ban pre marital relation , non coital sexual behaviour , and other action the state may not in fact wish to endorse . 2 
counterpoint : rarely be there a moral issue that do not require a nuanced explanation in some situation . there be no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater , however . the ten commandments form a good baseline from which child can learn , and then , a they become old , issue like the death penalty or just war can be explain to them in more depth . even if these be not absolute guideline , they can still be useful simplification . just a we teach child calculus or other advanced mathematics only after we have teach them division and multiplication , we can build their moral knowledge start with thou shall not kill and then later explain more complicated ethical exception . 
point : public school be run by the government and a such have an obligation to cleave to that principle of separation of church and state . it be against the ten commandments to believe in other god , but we expressly permit belief in other religious system and atheism via constitutional protection . not only be this a violation of the principle of separation , but it also send a mixed message to those group , and run the risk of alienate those who do not conform to these ideal . 1 posting the decalogue be obviously tremendously divisive a serious culture war of lawsuit , protest , and speech have be wag over the issue . unless school be to post text for literally every religion and atheism as well , this goal cannot be achieve if the ten commandments be in the classroom . 2 neutrality be the best antidote to contemporary culture war . 3 
counterpoint : this practice of post the commandments largely exist in conservative community which wholeheartedly embrace religion and the message of the ten commandments . by and large , only outsider tend to question core aspect of the culture in the school district that post the decalogue . 1 while minority right need to be respect , we should not structure the rule of society such that the urge of the majority to express something that be fundamental to them religious belief be consistently suppress because of a few naysayer or legal organization who do not understand the norm . they can go elsewhere , to community that share their religious view or lack thereof . 
point : the text be often translate differently from the original hebrew , reflect variance in intent on the part of different sect , such a protestants , jews , and catholics . this be a profoundly sensitive issue and any perceived favouritism on the part of the government would simply result in a great backlash . better to sidestep this problem altogether and have a blanket policy against post the decalogue . 
counterpoint : the case chambers v . marsh uphold the ability to have a chaplain give prayer before legislative session , and that be not at all doom by the fact that a particular denomination of chaplain have to be pick . posting of any version of the commandments would just serve to reinforce the same basic message that our government derive some authority from god . 1 
point : our legislator must be conscious of the danger of wrap the ten commandments in the flag and indicate that one faith or religious set of law be more patriotic or representative of the nation's fundamental value than another . 1 that idea can easily be use a a weapon against a minority's group right as well a their sense of belong to the country . regardless of the role they may have play at the founding , our current society be an extraordinarily multicultural one , compose of a variety of religious minority , include muslims , hindus , and buddhists . the world have see a tremendous rise in islamic extremism as well a in conservative xenophobic reaction to it for instance , the 2011 breivik attack in norway , and to prevent such thing from happen , our child need to know how to live together peacefully and value all background . 
counterpoint : there isn't anything wrong with display or teach the historical foundation of the country , even if we have expand beyond that original vision since then . in fact , maintain that heritage and our connection to it be very important if we be to remember who we be a a people . the court have rule that the legislature be allow to have a chaplain lead prayer before legislative session because it represent a tradition date back to the very first meeting of the legislature in the country . 1 such practice be reasonable way to honour our past . extremism be certainly a scourge to the world , but it be often perpetrate by psychologically disturb or unbalanced individual ; more political correctness in school will not make a meaningful difference . following such tradition will not prevent teach to respect all faith .
