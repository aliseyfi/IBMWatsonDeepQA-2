point : children should receive the same legal protection from violence a adult . it be wrong that parent can deliberately inflict pain to the extent that if inflict on an adult it would justify prosecution . in a number of country , include the united kingdom , child be the most vulnerable member of society , yet the only group which can be legally assault . the council of europe which monitor compliance with the european convention on human rights rule in 1998 that smack violated child s right against cruel and degrade treatment1 . furthermore , a time report , a hundred year ago it be consider a novel idea for the law to say you couldn t hit your wife . today child be the only class that be unprotected 2 . this be not right , child need more protection and not less 1 . it be time to right this wrong . 
counterpoint : we allow child to be treat in a different manner from adult because they need to be educate and be not yet old enough to learn correct behaviour through rational conversation or by an understanding of social norm in the way that adult be able to . we allow adult to restrict their children's movement , finance , eat and even who they socialise with . this be all undeniably acceptable behaviour but it would not be acceptable in the case of adult . the burden on the arguer be to prove that there be some kind of harm to treat child differently to adult . it be also true that physical punishment be sometimes acceptable within the adult community . society be unlikely to heavily condemn a woman who slap a man after he have make an excessively degrading comment or who make her uncomfortable with inappropriate sexual advance . furthermore , corporal punishment take place in the context of a love family environment where no harm be mean and there be mutual care . 
point : the exist mechanism to catch abusive parent be entrench in most society ; child abuse claim be often the result of third party observer , often teacher , call the police or child service . such a system would be expect to play a great role in society with a ban on smack initial penalty would be financial only , to ensure that parent be take away from their child only if they have prove themselves repeat offender . this charge would only be if the child be under 12 year of age . parents who feel that smack be an appropriate tool of discipline have to give up the privilege to physically discipline their child for the sake of protect child that aren t be hit once in a blue moon or in a light way , but be really be hit day after day , many time a day 1 . 
counterpoint : the law be ripe for exploitation and be no improvement on the current law in most state that parent can use any form of discipline provide it be not unjustifiable1 . how would the state deal with a case where one parent accuse another of smack but without evidence ? smacks do not always leave bruise and child often receive bruise from entirely different activity . 
point : only an outright ban on smack will enhance child protection . the number of child report be beat to the point of bruise in germany have decline from 3 in 10 to 3 in 100 since 1992 after a ban be introduce in germany . a culture that tolerate smack make it easy to conceal grave abuse . frequently , incident of abuse report by child be not investigate , or the case abandon a the abuse be write off a a case of legitimate punishment . a total ban enables child protection worker to give the parent of child at risk of abuse a clear message that no level of corporal punishment be acceptable . a parent who still continue to smack their child would no longer be able to hide behind the defence of reasonable chastisement . in european country with a longstanding smacking ban , there have be an increase in the early detection of child at risk , and a decrease in the proportion of parent who be subsequently prosecute . 
counterpoint : there be nothing to say that the occasionally smack one's child make one more comfortable with hurt the child . in fact , it be likely that parent do not enjoy smack their child and would prefer not to have to but see it a a necessary measure at time . many parent smack their child and do not abuse them . 
point : smacking , however occasional , be harmful to child . as well a cause physical pain there be last psychological effect . it be widely recognise that smack undermines children's confidence , weaken their emotional relationship and encourage the use of violence to resolve dispute with sibling and classmate . the experience of childhood smacking have even be link with an increase risk of alcoholism , depression , masochistic fantasy and suicidal ideation in adult life . professor murray straus test the iqs of child , spank and not spank , and find that the iqs of kid who be not spank stay the same over a four year period whilst the spanked toddler drop up to 5 points1 . 
counterpoint : there be only evidence to support this claim in case of excessive corporal punishment which be not the type of punishment to which this debate refers . it seem that this argument be very weak in reference to the occasional smack . furthermore , there be great harm do to child when parent provide too little discipline . a lack of boundary can leave child feel neglect and allow them to get themselves into harmful situation and struggle to implement discipline in their adult life . 
point : the un convention on the rights of the child require the country to protect child from all form of physical and mental violence . the committee on the rights of the child , it international monitoring body for the convention , emphasise that even physical punishment within the family be not compatible with full implementation , and have formally recommend prohibition to the uk and other country . in 1999 the european court of human rights find that the beating by a father of his stepson constitute inhuman or degrade punishment . the law in britain and other country that tolerate smacking should be bring into line with european law to ensure the respect of basic human right . 
counterpoint : all system of human right law be qualify . the question of whether the right concern be engage at all relies on prove that the act be illegitimate . further , even if the right be engage , if it be justified for one of the many reason write into the structure of the right themselves it will amount to a legitimate qualification of the right and therefore will not fall foul of the relevant legislation . finally , european human rights law allow a margin of discretion for national law to take into account cultural difference and the judgment of legislator . 
point : smacking be harmful to society a normative form of violence spill over into criminal form . as corporal punishment be a significant factor in the development of violent behaviour in childhood and later life , an outright ban would help measure to reduce violence and crime . banning smack would also help to promote the concept of zero tolerance of violence between all family member and thus reduce all form of domestic violence , as well a reduce bully between child . as sir al aynsley green , children's commissioner in england , have note , 'we continue to send out confuse message to parent about the acceptable use of violence across society1 . a strong , consistent message need to be apply , start with a total ban of smacking . 
counterpoint : the evidence for this be non existent . there be clear correlation in a society between poverty and violence , availability of weapon and violence , widespread drug use and violence , absence of parent and violence . the assertion of a link between smack and social violence be highly dubious give the cross national variation between level of violence and crime between country with the same policy on smacking , as well a the strength of correlation with other factor . this be no more than an assertion of hippy faith .
