point : a thousand year ago we would have be dead by the time we be forty . now , it be consider strange for someone to die at that age . setting aside religion , we will find that any decision , mark or setting , any limit or law moral or legal on when we should die , be always go to be wholly arbitrary . 
counterpoint : just because we would have to make an arbitrary decision do not mean that it would be the wrong decision . there be thousand of arbitrary rule that govern our life and yet we do not question them . the proposition argument be fallacious . just because something be arbitrary do not mean it be wrong . 
point : every specie seek to adapt , to enable itself to survive good . what would be a good way to improve the human specie than to make u unable to die ? 
counterpoint : this do not fit into a logical argument . yes , every specie do seek to adapt to suit it environment , but specie do not seek immortality of the individual . they want their young to survive , and their young following that . this be entirely selfless . however , to seek immortality of the individual , or of the self : that be selfish and therefore unethical . by seek immortality of the self we be take away from the cycle of life . we should die know that we have leave behind something to help , not continue live to make resource hard to come by . 
point : just like the medical technology we already have to enhance and prolong our life , whatever technique we use to become immortal will be another tool . tools by themselves be ethically neutral . if human decide to hoard the technology or only sell it at an extortionately high price , it will be unethical behaviour , but it won't make the technology itself unethical . debating what the danger of immortality be be vital to bring immortality into the world in a rash , ignorant way would itself be unethical but call immortality , a a concept , 'unethical' be false . 
counterpoint : it be unethical since the science will not be freely and equally distribute when if it be practise . 
point : aging be the great killer , a nick bostrom argue age be a tyrant that kill u by the cartload and what do we do to stop it ? 1 it be a moral imperative that we should attempt to stop this killer . yet many argue that immortality be unethical . it seem people have dismiss the point at hand because they have simply not think long enough about it . we measure and judge ourselves in relation to life and death all the time , and we act accordingly : life a positive ; death a negative . we work constantly to keep ourselves alive , by eat by stay safe ; everything we do be aim at preserve life . but we don't carry that principle into the specific study of immortality and the ethic of trans humanism in general . to dismiss immortality a unethical be equivalent to dismiss our most basic of human instinct , that of survival , and the primacy of human life in morality and science . 
counterpoint : immortality with superlative health ; for each and every one of u ; be arguably ethical . albeit if a mean to achieve immortality be invent ; it would be patent not freely distribute . immortality be not the same a be disease free . suffering and age would in all probability continue , just in different way . the age gene be not the death gene ; there be no death gene ; so to speak . 
point : the holy book of all three monotheist religion christianity , islam and judaism claim that prophets like noah and adam live to be about a thousand year far long than the high recorded lifespan of the modern human ; less than 200 year . 1 the claim that longevity be irreligious can be easily shirk off , take into account these religious parable . 
counterpoint : death be mortality . immortality in the afterlife require mortality in this one , at least in the physical sense . we be encourage to employ various strategy to bring u close to heaven a good next life .
