point : government intervention in the marketplace contradict the value of free trade advocate by western liberal democracy . the complexity of agricultural subsidy , price support , regulation and protective tariff mean that farm in the us and the eu now have the air of a command economy . coupled with highly liberal international trade market and the relative ease of ship foodstuff around the world , subsidy scheme be increasingly subject to manipulation by farmer seek to maximise the size of their support payment without engage in additional productive activity . for example , set aside i payment have be use by both european and american administration to encourage farmer to leave a proportion of their field fallow , in order to maintain the productivity and fertility of farm soil . however , many farmer have claim set aside payment by designate fertile land that be difficult or impossible cultivate land on steep incline , land obstruct by stream a fallow field . 
counterpoint : a subsidised farming industry be not protectionism rather it help to create the most stable farming infrastructure possible . agricultural commodity be subject to significant swing in price , due unpredictable change in the weather , in pest activity and market volatility . without government support to smooth the impact of market fluctuation , huge number of american farmer would be push into bankruptcy and force off of their land and into penury . this would have knock on effect on economy throughout europe and the united states , and would devastate many small rural community . 
point : subsidies cause poverty , both domestically and internationally . by maintain the price of certain good at a low level that do not reflect their market price , subsidy prevent farmer in the developing world from sell comparable good to international customer for a comparable price . despite high labor cost wealthy western farmer be able to undercut their poorer counterpart in the developing world , with any shortfall in their income account for by their government subsidy . 
counterpoint : neither the us nor the eu can be hold responsible for international externality cause by subsidy policy . if the us be to stop funding it farming industry , other develop nation would continue to engage in practice that would distort the international market . indeed , the usa s share of world food export have be either flat or fall for almost 25 year , so it would be disproportionate to claim that the us be the primary cause of decline farm revenue in the developing world . 
point : subsidies can contribute significantly to long term ecological and environmental damage . by render the export of food so profitable , subsidy increase the use of air freight and rapid road haulage , increase the emission cost of trading produce . 
counterpoint : food be a unique good , in the sense that it be essential for sustain life , and play a significant role in ensure social stability and support the health and development of child . governments should not gamble on an industry that supply a commodity of such great importance by expose farmer to the fluctuation and speculative impulse of the food market . nor should farmer and their crop be expose the effect of sudden environmental change without some form of defence mechanism or insurance scheme be put in place .
