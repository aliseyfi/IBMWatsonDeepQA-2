point : football be move into the twenty first century , yet the refusal to embrace glt be completely out date . nowhere in fifa policy do it state that referee cannot use the influence of technology . in fifas disciplinary code 2009 , article 72 state that : 1 during match , disciplinary decision be take by the referee , and 2 these decision be final 1 . the referee already act on the advice of the assistant referee regard incident that he have not see and can change decision base on advice2 . all referee also have an earpiece introduce in 2006 link the two assistant ref and the fourth official , which already demonstrate technology's successful impact in football . glt be simply the next step . 
counterpoint : football have operate successfully for over 100 year without glt . two assistant referee be introduce in 1891 , 28 year after the rule of association football be coin ; a fourth official be introduce in 1991 ; and fifa recently introduce two additional assistant referee in europa league game . football have demonstrate that it be willing and capable to adjust to the demand of wider exposure without have to resort to glt . 
point : glt technology be readily available and could be quickly implement . hawkeye , use in tennis and cricket , would serve the glt purpose very well . though eventually dismiss , it be suggest that gps technology could measure whether player be offside or not . cameras be already set up for television with enough angle to make decision ; it would be simple to set up monitor pitch side so that official could watch replay footage . currently , viewer watch at home be able to make much more informed decision than match official . 
counterpoint : it would still require a large initial outlay of cash in order to equip all stadium with the technology and train official in use it . also , the technology would need to be constantly re design and re develop so that it could keep up with technological advance ; this would be extremely expensive and endless , but necessary to keep technology up to date , relevant and fit for purpose . some people suggest that the money would be good spent improve exist official option , such a improve referee academy . 
point : technology have be prove to work across a wide range of sport from tennis , cricket and rugby . a survey of it implementation in the 2011 australian open demonstrate the impact that guarantee correct decision have on several game . 1 it have become a natural aid to sport . glt would only be use on a goal decision , much like tennis us challenge only once a rally have stop . football be no more fluid a sport than any of the others . if a debatable goal be score , play would stop anyway while one team celebrates and the other protest to the official . 1 kelvin goodchild , hawk eye : big impact at crucial moments , tennislife magazine , 29th january 2011 , access 25 05 11 5 
counterpoint : challenges in tennis and cricket be limit to three per side here the number of challenge be potentially unlimited and glt could be invoke whenever a team sense the possibility of gain an advantage . without limitation , the game could be endlessly stop while official turn to technology to confirm their decision . 
point : goals be the ultimate measure of success in football ; technology would reduce the risk of team lose match unfairly due to controversial decision see fifa world cup quarter final 2010 england v germany . there be no reason to expose referee to criticism , threat and derision when we have the mean to help them . glt be a tool meant to assist referee in their decision , not undermine them . 
counterpoint : take , for example , sunderland s freak victory at liverpool in october 2009 , the so called beachball incident where a winning goal be deflect off a large red beach ball , it may well have go in anyway but it undoubtedly distract the keeper . 1 glt and instant replay would not have resolve the controversy , a the ambiguity be legal ; the law do not have a clear position on the incident . glt would have be useless here ; it be only as useful a the law and human behind it .
