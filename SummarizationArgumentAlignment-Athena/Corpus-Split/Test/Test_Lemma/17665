point : it be gravely unfortunate that politics have become an accepted career path for citizen of democratic state . it be far good that participation in government be brief . to end politics a a lifetime sinecure , thereby make legislative service a leave of absence , rather than a mean of permanently abscond from a productive career in the private sector , require that there be term limit 1 . without term limit , the temptation to remain in office for life will keep people seek reelection long after they have accomplish all the legislative good of which they be capable . it do not take long for legislator to become more occupied with their relationship with each other and with lobbyist , than with their constituent . representative assembly work best when they function a citizen legislature , in which people who pursue career other than politics enter the legislative forum for a brief time to do their country service , and then leave again to reenter society a private citizens2 . such citizen legislator who enter politics to make their mark and then leave be far more desirable than the career politician of today who focus only on build their own power influence , rather than consider the people they be elect to represent . us state with 'citizen legislatures' , where the state legislature be part time with short session so allow it member to hold other job , be at the top of freedom index . new hampshire be both the most minimal parliament and the state with most fiscal freedom accord to the ruger sorens index . 31 will , george . 1993 . restoration : congress , term limits , and the restoration of deliberative democracy . new york : free press . 2 bandow , doug . 1995 . real term limits : now more than ever . cato institute policy analysis . 3 3 rugar , william and sorens , jason . 2011 . the citizen legislature : how reasonable limits on state legislative salaries , staff and session lengths keep liberty alive policy brief , goldwater institute , 6 
counterpoint : if people wish to pursue a career in politics , then it be their right to do so . there be nothing wrong with career politician so long a they obey the will of their people and accurately represent the desire of their constituent . while there should be no bar to people seek to enter politics on a temporary basis , place that form of political participation over a more lasting one make no sense . furthermore , career politician have valuable experience that can be extremely useful in the forming of legislation and the conducting of public business . term limit destroy this valuable resource by cast people out of the hall of government at a fixed point , regardless of the worth they might still impart to the legislative process . 
point : incumbency provide a huge election advantage . politicians almost always win reelection . the frequency with which they win varies over time and between state , but incumbency be always a powerful advantage . this be see most visibly in the united states congress of the past 30 year , in which it have become virtually impossible to unseat an incumbent legislator . legislators be reelect because they have good name recognition both with the electorate and with lobby group . people have a tendency to vote for whom they recognize , and firm tend to support past winner who will likely continue to benefit their interest . term limit actually increase voter choice by make election more competitive and encourage more candidate to run . in area where term limit have be institute there be far high turnover amongst legislator , give voter far more choice in who should represent them . in california , the institution of term limit on state legislator cause a rush of retirement , which lead to 50 percent more candidate than would otherwise have be expect , as well a a marked increase in the diversity of the background of those elect 1 . ultimately , old legislator use election machine to retain power do their country and constituent a disservice . power be best use when it change hand over time in order to allow for dynamic new solution to be moot in a changing world . 
counterpoint : term limit legislator insult the intelligence of the electorate . individuals can make prudent decision about who to vote for , and it so happen that that decision be often to keep incumbent in power . if the reason for such high reelection rate be due to an uneducated or disaffected electorate , then the problem be not be solve by simply institute term limit . rather , such result mean an effort must be make to educate voter and to fight voter apathy . neither of those thing be accomplish by limit the choice of the voter . 
point : power be highly intoxicating ; it can corrupt even the most scrupled individual give enough exposure over time . for this reason , power should not be leave in the hand of specific individual for too long . when a politician be firmly entrench , he may seek to enrich himself at the expense of the public . he may seek to shower benefice on family and ally in order to maintain and strengthen his powerful position . without term limit legislator often become self serving individual , more interested in crave out personal power base than with serve the people who elect them . because legislator be so likely to be reelect , lobbyist and special interest group find the line of power in states' capital largely predictable , and be thus able to buy the influence of the permanent power nexus in the legislature with relative ease1 . term limit serve to limit the ability of individual to put forward self serve legislation and to retain power indefinitely 2 . instead , by maintain term limit , legislator have only a limited time in power , which tend to shift their focus toward genuinely benefit the public . 
counterpoint : people be intelligent enough to recognize whether a representative be benefit them or not . they will not vote for someone who be use his privileged position in the legislature to enrich himself or build a fiefdom of influence . rather , legislator will only be able to stay in office so long a they do what their constituent want . if legislator be maintain their power by other mean , such a institutionalized corruption and force , it be not because there be no term limit on them , but rather because of other fundamental problem of government in those state . 
point : a major focus of a legislator hop to serve another term be on the next election and on vote get . it be often the case that hard decision need to be make by legislator , but it be difficult for them to do so when they be fixate on be reelect . legislators have an incentive to put tough decision off if they can retain power by do so . an example of such seemingly perpetual procrastination be observable in the united states congress's attitude toward social security . the fund be set to become insolvent , by some estimate , in less than two decade , yet congressman and senator have choose time and again to put off enact painful , but necessary reform to the system . they find it easy to delay a decision until the next congress , prefer their own reelection to the good of the nation . when constrain by term limit , legislator must make the most of their limited time in office , result in great prioritization of difficult decision and reform1 . furthermore , the need to constantly fight election place politician in the pocket of lobby group and election supporter to a great degree , a they will always need to go back to them for support , and thus cannot make decision that be in the national interest alone . while there will always be some of this behavior , it be curtail by term limit , a legislator will , in their final term at the very least , not be behold to a many special interest a they cannot run again . bolder legislative action be observe from retire legislator in the united states congress , for example . when a congressman or senator do not intend to seek reelection , his tendency to vote along strict party line diminishes substantially . term limit , just like voluntary retirement , lead legislator to vote more on the basis of principle than on party stance2 . the result of this be a more independent legislature , with a great interest in actually serve the people . 
counterpoint : a term limited legislator suffers from the effect of be a lame duck . a final term legislator will not be able to command the same degree of leverage a one who can potentially serve another term . building the necessary support for worthy legislation might thus prove far more difficult than it would have have the legislator not be a lame duck . furthermore , with regard to lobby group support , a politician on the way out who cannot seek another term have an incentive to favor group and firm that will place him on their board , a potentially highly lucrative retirement package for outgo legislator , pay for often at the expense of the public .
