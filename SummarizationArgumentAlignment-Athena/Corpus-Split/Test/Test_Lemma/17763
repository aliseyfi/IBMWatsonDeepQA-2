point : the house of lords be undemocratic . currently the member of the house of lords consist of hereditary peer , senior member of the church of england and those appoint by political party . whether or not there be an abuse of power or the outcome of the house of lords be beside the point it very existence in it current state be undemocratic and a such it should be reform . it seem nonsensical that a country that lecture to the rest of the world the importance of democracy , to the point of war , should overlook such a grievance in their own society . 
counterpoint : although the house of lords may not be a true expression of democracy , it have a positive function in the governing of the country and be base in a tradition and heritage that the people of britain should not try and abandon . one could argue in return that those very decision and war that britain be in involve in to defend democracy do not reflect the will of the people and that modern state be not true democracy at all . in practice the british people have a limited say in how the country be run and it would be na√Øve to champion the idea of britain be a democracy by ignore the existence of such an overpower state machine . 
point : the 19th century us president abraham lincoln state that democracy should be government of the people , by the people , for the people 1 therefore peer who sit in the house base on noble birth right or their membership of the church of england , that be itself largely ignore by the people , do not represent the people of britain . 
counterpoint : the house of lords may not be representative of the british population but instead they represent an array of educate expert who can give informed advice on government policy . 
point : the traditional provenance of the house of lords translates to an in built conservative majority . even so called liberal and labour peer be usually conservative in their opinion . they represent a social and economic elite and seem to flaunt diversity monitoring in a house with only 181 female peer and a staggeringly low 31 peer from ethnic minority . 1 this unfair skew in the favour of the conservative have the power to slow down and revise legislation and be a gross misrepresentation of the british population . the house of lords should be reform in order to well reflect the british people so that their action and decision benefit the whole of society and not just their own . 
counterpoint : the accusation that the house of lords be inherently conservative be an unjust accusation , a prove by their siding with the people on unpopular government policy such a student tuition fee and the 42 day detention . today no party have a majority in the chamber , with independent peer hold the balance of power in any vote . 
point : reform of the house of lords would strengthen the legitimacy of the house and therefore improve it function . by elect the second chamber they would gain the legitimacy to not simply stall bill but reject them all together or draft bill of their own , thus facilitate a more dynamic government , able to change . using a different electoral technique , for example proportional representation with member sit for long period would allow them to still be of a different composition to the house of commons and not sway to short term political popularity . electing different portion at different time would also guard against a freak landslide result affect the house s balance . by create a worthy opposition to the house of commons all issue would be debate and decide upon more fairly and government would be more closely monitor . 
counterpoint : house of lords reform defeat the point ; firstly the election process would deter many industry expert and attract political opportunist instead , thus eliminate the current worth of the house of lords . it likely that if elect the house of lords would simply become a mirror for the house of commons . by be non elect the house of lords be free from political sway and can work in the long term interest of the country .
