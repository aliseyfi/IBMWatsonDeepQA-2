point : even if no agenda be be consciously or subconsciously pursue , school pupil be present with oversimplified information in history . this be a result of the limited time available , the limited intellectual capacity of pupil , the limited knowledge of many teacher who may not be history specialist , especially in primary school and the desire for answer that can be label a correct or incorrect in examination . much school history teaching be therefore concerned simply with memorise fact . however , such learn need to be accompany by a deep understanding of event , lack definitive answer but provide a narrative to give the 'facts' often figure mean . as school recognize this be beyond most student , they struggle to make time spend in history lesson conducive ; a study in america find that only 20 percent of fourth grader be proficient in history , while that drop to 12 per cent for high school seniors1 . 1 resmovits , joy . u . s . history test scores stagnate as education secretary arne duncan seeks 'plan b' . huffington post . june 14 , 2011 . access july 14 , 2011 . 1 
counterpoint : where there be uncertainty , this can and should be highlight if pupil have the intellectual capacity to understand the debate . much of the benefit of study history be that it be not or should not be solely base upon the learning of fact . rather , history develop the ability to evaluate and challenge different interpretation . if historical study be postpone to adulthood , this would mean that most people would learn no history , unless they choose to study for a history degree . and it be impossible to escape any discussion of history in adult life there be many television programme and press article devote to historical subject every day , and politician constantly refer to past event to justify their action . only if citizen be equip at school to question such historical interpretation can the public avoid be mislead . 
point : history be not objective and , in school , historical fact be at the mercy of those in control of the curriculum . even when there be no attempt to deceive or manipulate , postmodernist critique of history suggest all history teach will reflect the preconception and aim of those who set and teach the curriculum . the british government announce in early 2006 that history taught in school should seek to engender a sense of britishness by stress a share political and cultural heritage1 . the education secretary at the time ask school to 'play a leading role in create community cohesion' by do so1 . even if no historical event be invent a such , this will nevertheless lead to an unbalanced account , in which event that support modern political social end be highlight and others receive less attention . the principle that such tainted information , whether implicit or explicit , can be teach to child be dangerous . 1 bbc news . schools 'must teach britishness' . bbc news . january 25 , 2007 . access july 14 , 2011 . 2 
counterpoint : what be teach in history will never be 100 accurate , but it be possible for historian to achieve a considerable degree of objectivity , especially if they seek to be aware of the influence upon their own thinking . part of most secondary school history curriculum be the consideration of how historian be affect by the context in which they write : this equip pupils to consider critically what they be be teach and why they be be teach it . moreover , it can be argue that worthwhile end e . g . the good relation between different ethnic community seek by the british government justify some selection of the history that be teach to schoolchildren . after all , it isn't possible to teach child everything about all historical period , so there must be some criterion for make choice about what would be most valuable to study . a 'british' history curriculum will aid integration and encourage multi culturalism within the country , without sacrifice truth , merely breadth . 
point : history taught in school sometimes involve flagrant distortion of historical evidence either by the state or by individual teacher . attempts may be make to avoid nasty aspect of a nation's past e . g . the massacre of chinese civilian by japanese soldier at nanking in 1937 and or to put down other people e . g . the presentation of australian aboriginals a uncivilized until the 1960s . japan's attempt to erase the memory of nanking in it schoolchildren begin in 1950s when it ban a third of all textbook and 'nanking massacre simply disappeared' from their history1 . as well a these extreme example , low level anti americanism be arguably pervasive in modern french school textbook , reflect tension between france and the usa arising from the latter's gaullist heritage and the recent war on terror . it be highly undesirable for school pupil to be expose to misinformation peddle in history class , which can lead to violence , hatred or discrimination . 1 chapel , joseph . denying genocide : the evolution of the denial of the holocaust and the nanking massacre . university of california : santa barbara . may 2004 . access july 14 , 2011 . 3 
counterpoint : isolated instance in which history have be use for propaganda purpose do not reflect a dangerous subject , merely dangerous regime . the vast majority of history teaching do not seek to promote such agenda . it be common sense to tailor the national history curriculum to the nation in which it be be teach , and very easily achieve without constitute propaganda . recent study have show it be common for state to focus heavily on their national history , 'setting out key event that shape the national story a compulsory knowledge'1 . furthermore , all subject can be distort if the state and it teacher be prepared to try hard enough for example , under the nazis german child be taught mathematics with a heavy emphasis upon military application e . g . calculate angle and range for artillery . instead of ban the subject , what be need be proper inspection of school and monitoring of the curriculum , under the control of a democratic government . 1 baker , mike . history study need fact first , analysis later . the guardian . february 18 , 2011 . access july 14 , 2011 . 4
