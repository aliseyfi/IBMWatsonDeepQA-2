point : a sensible libertarian position accept the right of people to do whatever they like as long a it doesn t infringe upon the life of anyone else . that may sound like something that anyone could sign up to but the reality be not so simple . the right may defend corporate greed and the left government intervention but there be a clear principle ; i have the right not to have my air poison by your chemical company which mean i don t have to pay for any government body to clear up the mess . 
counterpoint : it be impossible in any modern state to pretend that the state simply isn t there or that individual on their own can act against multinationals or government department and agency . 
point : a libertarian agenda be one that draw people from across the political spectrum . the crisis in the financial sector have confirm for many that government and large financial institution have simply get too close . republicans say they can reduce the size of government but never do , democrats say they can regulate corporation but show no sign of do so . 
counterpoint : experience teach u that if you simply remove the government then those who be currently strong get stronger and those who be weak get destroy . tackling issue such a prejudice in the workplace , health and safety , protect the vulnerable , manage immigration and a million others require not only the involvement of the state but for a government that be actively engage in counter private interest . to allow the market to run unfettered seem unlikely to protect the right of the individual but , rather would cede hard fought right to the rapacious interest of corporation . 
point : one of principal reason for the growth of libertarian party , especially in the west , be the dominance of one particular ideological viewpoint that be broadly share by all the major party . 
counterpoint : the appropriate response , in a democracy , to a hegemonic political class be not to scrap the state altogether but simply to vote for someone else .
