point : antarctica be a pristine and unspoilt continent of great scientific value . in particular , it have a critical impact on the world's environment and ocean system . antarctic science have reveal much about the impact of human activity on the natural world . the discovery in 1985 by scientist at british antarctic survey bas of the hole in the ozone layer above antarctica reveal the damage do to the earth's atmosphere by man make chemical . this mean that it must be leave undisturbed , in order to allow further study of such critical international issue a climate change , ozone depletion , long range weather forecasting and the operation of marine eco system crucial to sustainable fishing . the very placement of mine that produce emission on the continent may perhaps themselves affect the scientific reading , only by have antarctica completely undisturbed can we guarantee the level of accuracy we now have . 
counterpoint : while scientific research be important , there may come a time when the need for resource exceed the need for antarctica to be leave alone . therefore perhaps we should consider continue scientific research in antarctica while also use the resource it have available . as antarctica be such a large continent , it seem possible that mine for it resource can occur on one side of the continent , while the other half could be maintain for scientific research . the distance between each base would mean that hopefully neither would directly affect the others work too much . furthermore , a the scientist would be actively work they would be able to notice if any abnormality be occur because of the exploitation of resource , and if this be the case could promote discussion between government , miner and scientist in order to come to a new arrangement . 
point : opening antarctica to exploitation would create a serious danger of pollution . this would arise both from oil or other spill and other spoilage that could potentially occur while drill for resource ; the mean of transport use to get both worker and machine to antarctica ; and from the increase human presence . this pollution could then lead to disaster for antarctica and the world in general , a it contribute to global warming . in antarctica this may lead to the melting of ice cap , the breaking of ice sheet , which result in loss of habitat and food for creature such a penguins and krill . it be believe that over 13 , 000 square kilometre of antarctica s ice have melt in the last 50 year , over the past five year , study have find that melt antarctic ice cap contribute at least 15 to the current global sea level rise of 2mm 0 . 08in a year . worldwide , the melt ice can lead to rise sea level , and an increase in global temperature ; in 2001 , the intergovernmental panel on climate change predict the average global sea level would rise by between 11cm 4 . 3in and 77cm 30 . 3in by 2100 . the consequence of this be increase rainfall , increase risk of volcanic eruption , severe risk of flood particularly in area such a shanghai , lagos , texas and north carolina , problem with farming , increase risk of tropical disease and an increase in insect life new scientist , natural resources defence council , cool antarctica , scar , bbc news . 
counterpoint : these concern be counter by the suggestion that by far the great impact on the antarctic be external , e . g . the impact of cfcs on the ozone layer over the south pole , global warming , the effect of whale and pollution on the marine environment . compared to these global influence , limited exploitation of antarctic resource under strict environmental regulation will not make a significant difference . 
point : there be many reason why oil and gas exploration should not be allow in the antarctic . firstly , proven and probable reserve of oil and gas be still rise faster than global consumption , so there be no economic need to exploit any hypothetical antarctic source . furthermore , the economics of exploit antarctica s resource suggest that it would cost far more that current oil reserve . it be estimate by coolantarctica . com 2008 that each barrel of oil from antarctica would cost usd 100 , whereas current reserve of oil cost on average usd 77 a barrel . also , at a practical level , the cost of exploration and production would be completely uneconomic , especially give the hostile climate and the serious iceberg threat to offshore rig , tanker and pipeline , as well a the very deep continental shelf . the condition would be even more difficult for more conventional mining onshore where the mining would need to go through the icecap . 
counterpoint : oil and gas exploration should be allow , both on the antarctic continent and in the southern ocean surround it . although current technology would not enable exploitation of any reserve at economic price , future technological advance and rise in the price of fossil fuel may change this equation . once , deep water extraction from the hostile north sea or arctic oceans seem impossible , but now these be take for grant . 
point : one of antarctica s seek after resource be it fish . antarctica have suffer greatly from overfishing in it past ; fur seal , elephant seal , and the great whale be all hunt to the brink of extinction . now , a many other ocean have already be overfished , fisherman be once again turn to antarctic water , particularly for it krill . yet overfishing have dangerous consequence , not just for the fish itself ; overfishing risk collapse the fragile ocean ecology all together national geographic . one example of this be that if we overfish krill then there be less food for the humpback whale that feed on krill . this could lead to a reduction in the amount of humpback whale that remain alive , and perhaps even an extinction of the specie . 
counterpoint : the antarctic ocean be under exploit compare to all other fishery . quotas for different specie be set very low by scientist stick to very conservative precautionary principle , and could in most case be greatly expand without risk of over fishing . indeed , increase catch limit would remove much of the incentive for illegal fishing , and might reduce the pressure on other , less well protected fishery elsewhere . if fish stock be find to be under pressure , then quota can be reduce once again .
