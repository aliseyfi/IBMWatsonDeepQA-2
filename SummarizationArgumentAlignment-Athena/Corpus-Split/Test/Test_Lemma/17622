point : there be still many way for gay people to become parent . some of them be able to pay for a surrogate ; some may have a natural child from a previous heterosexual relationship and then raise the child with a gay partner . in effect , what this law do be make it impossible for two gay people to have legal right over a child they may already be raise together . these kid deserve the security of two legally recognize parent . if be raise by gay parent be really that harmful , why would the law allow two gay people to raise a child together a parent but refuse to legally recognize them a such ? 
counterpoint : because no democratic government should ever attempt to regulate people's reproductive right and dictate who be or isn't allow to have child . and unless a massive harm can be show to the child , the government usually doesn't take child away from their parent , a that might be more harmful . but the government be allow to define what a family be or should be , under the law . 
point : the overwhelming majority of scientific study on this issue have convincingly show that child raise by gay couple be certainly not bad off than those raise by straight parents1 . some study have go as far a to demand that in the face of this evidence , gay ban be ended2 . based on the robust nature of the evidence available , the court in florida be satisfy in 2010 that the issue be beyond dispute and they strike down the ban3 . when there isn't any scientific evidence to support the differential treatment of one group , it be only base on prejudice and bigotry , which should have no place in a democratic society . 
counterpoint : the scientific debate be not as settle a proponent of gay right claim . the study , while positive in their conclusion , have generally be base on very small sample , not more than a dozen family . some expert claim that there be also a volunteer bias , with the subject of these study usually supportive of the gay right agenda and therefore keen on report positive result . lastly , the researcher themselves can be bias and willing to find evidence to back a political agenda1 . 
point : discrimination be the practice of treat people differently base not on individual merit but on their membership to a certain group . the adoption ban be a clear example . rather than assess gay couple individually , it be simply assume that they would all make bad parent because they be gay , while straight couple be assess base on their individual merit . this breach the fundamental right of all people to be treat equally under the law and it should be stop . this principle be enshrine in the universal declaration of human rights ; article 1 all human being be bear free and equal in dignity and right . 1 and also many other national and regional legal text e . g . the us constitution , 2 the european convention on human rights . 
counterpoint : states place many restriction on adoption . china , for example , do not permit adoption by couple who be too old , have disability or be obese1 . it doesn't mean that there be anything wrong with be overweight , old , or disable . but the chinese authority be try to decrease the likelihood of the adopt child lose a parent before the age of 18 , which for these kid can be especially traumatic . if the parent be gay can be show to be inherently harmful or less desirable for a child than straight parent , then such a ban would not constitute discrimination . it would be a decision base on a relevant and valid criterion . 
point : getting marry and raise a family be consider in most society one of the most important and fulfilling experience one can aspire to . it be so important it be consider a human right article 8 of the european convention on human rights state everyone have the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence . 1 it be consider so important for people to be able to become parent that some government the uk , for example fund fertility treatment for couple who be reproductively challenge , and a majority of the population support that policy2 . but member of the lgbt community be stop from pursue this human right by repressive and discriminatory law . 
counterpoint : just because the government will protect people's right to have a family from outside interference , and will publicly fund the treatment of a medical condition , such a infertility , it doesn't mean the government have to give child to those who don't or be unable to have any in order to protect their right to a family life .
