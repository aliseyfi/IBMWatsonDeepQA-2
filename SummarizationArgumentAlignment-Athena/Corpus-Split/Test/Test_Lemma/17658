point : the universal declaration of human rights a list of right to which the united nations have declare that all human being should be entitle state that everyone have the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well be of himself and of his family 1 . more than 50 study carry out worldwide have find that people be at an increase risk of lung cancer if they work or live with somebody who smokes2 . given these very serious health risk , it go against people's human right to be expose to second hand smoke when they have not choose to breathe it in . to avoid this happening , smoking should be ban in public place , so that non smoker can be sure that they will not have to breathe in second hand smoke . 
counterpoint : it be very difficult to properly scientifically measure the risk for non smoker of be expose to second hand smoke . to do a proper experiment , scientist would need to find a large group of people who have never be expose to cigarette smoke before , split them into two group , and then systematically expose one group to second hand smoke for a period of time while the other group stay smoke free . they would then have to wait and see if more of the group expose to second hand smoke develop lung cancer than the other group over their life . this would be a very expensive and time consume experiment . besides this , it would be very difficult to find people who have never breathe in cigarette smoke and keep half of them that way for their whole life for comparison . because of these difficulty in the ideal experiment , scientist often just use questionnaire , ask people to try and remember how many cigarettes the person they live with smoke in a day , for how many hour a day they be expose to smoking , etc . these kind of study be far from precise , since human memory be not very accurate , and so no truly scientific conclusion can be drawn1 . therefore , it be not a fact that non smoker expose to the smoke of others be at a serious health risk , so the proposition cannot say that have to sometimes be around other people who smoke go against non smokers' human right . 
point : the health problem that smoker experience cost taxpayer where healthcare be provide by the government or the individual for private healthcare a lot of money . decreasing the number of smoker a a result of a reduction in both social smoker those who smoke when out with friend and passive smoker those who do not smoke themselves but be expose to the second hand smoke of others will lead to a decrease in these healthcare cost . this have be report for example in arizona , where a study find that hospital admission due to diagnosis for which there be evidence for a cause by smoke have decrease since the statewide smoking ban , and that cost have thus decrease 1 . 
counterpoint : if the government want to save money , they should not be try to reduce smoking level , since smoker be the source of a great deal of tax income . while the nhs might spend some of their money on smoker whose health issue may or may not be directly to their smoking habit , the government receive much more money from the tax pay on cigarette . for example , smoking be estimate by researcher at oxford university to cost the nhs in the uk 5bn 5 billion pound a year 1 , but the tax revenue from cigarette sale be twice as much about 10bn 10 billion pound a year 2 . so government which implement smoke ban actually lose money . 
point : not be able to smoke in public will make it more difficult for smoker to keep up with their habit . for example , if they be no longer able to smoke in the pub , smoker would have to go outside possibly in the rain or other uncomfortable weather and be away from their non smoking friend every time they want to have a cigarette . so , a smoking ban would encourage smoker to smoke less frequently and maybe even give up . this can be see in country already with smoke ban . for example , a study in england find that in the nine month after the smoking ban be introduce , there be a 5 . 5 fall in the number of smoker in the country , compare to the much low fall of 1 . 6 in the nine month before the ban 1 . this can only be a good thing , since give up smoke decrease the risk of death , even for those suffer from early stage lung cancer 2 . 
counterpoint : while some study have show that number of smoker in country in which a smoking ban have be introduce have fall , it seem that these result only represent those people who be try to quit smoke anyway , with the smoking ban act a an added incentive . studies in england have show that while there be a rise in the number of smoker try to quit soon after the ban in 2007 , that rise have fall again since1 . so , while there be an initial fall in the number of smoker , the smoking ban in england be not have a continue effect on whether more people be give up the habit . additionally , it can be argue that since people be continue to smoke in country with a smoking ban , but not do so in public , there must be more smoke go on within the home . if there be any danger of second hand smoke , then a smoking ban move those danger from responsible adult who can choose whether to go somewhere where smoking be allow in public to child who cannot in the home , which be immoral . 
point : a ban in all public place would be no more difficult to introduce than exist ban prevent smoking in only some public place . as long a people be give plenty of notice of change , a be do in airport in saudi arabia , and the rule be make clear and readily available1 there should be few difficulty in introduce this ban . 
counterpoint : this ban would not be so easy to introduce . a ban on smoking in all public place would not be easily accept by all . for example , there be group in england seek to change the exist ban there so that more place be exempt ; the save our pubs clubs campaign want to change the smoking ban so that large venue can have a designate smoking area which can be avoid by non smokers1 .
