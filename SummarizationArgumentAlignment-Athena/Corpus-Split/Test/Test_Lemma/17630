point : as a society we should put effort into help those suffer from mental illness and detention be one way of be sure that they be receive and maintain treatment . this also mean that doctor be able to keep an eye on patient so that if the patient be no longer a risk , they can be let out . if patient be detain then doctor will have a good idea of their patient's usual behaviour and therefore be good at read their symptom . 
counterpoint : this could lead to doctor who diagnose certain psychiatric disorder effectively become jailer , and this be not their job or responsibility . some doctor may refuse to be and many medical professional will avoid identify a patient a have dspd if they know that this may result in their patient be detain . this could result in people with dangerous mental health problem go entirely unidentified far bad than the current situation . 
point : the public be at risk from people with know dangerous mental health problem . two people be kill every month by care in the community patient in the uk care in the community describe in scrapbook . jonathan zito be stab to death by christopher clunis in 1992 ; jason mitchell behead his father and strangle two pensioner in 1994 ; stephen laudat kill his grandfather in 1994 , believe him to be the gang leader ronnie kray ; john rous stab care worker jonathan newby to death in 1995 ; michael stone kill lin and megan russell in a field near their home in 1996 . all of these killer have diagnose mental illness but could not be detain under uk law , yet if they have be detain many life would have be save . currently , people with mental health problem who have not commit an offence may only be detain for the purpose of treatment , and may avoid treatment if they can argue that they will receive no benefit from it . there be no known effective treatment for dangerous severe personality disorder dspd . this mean that people with dspd fall through a gap between the criminal justice system and the healthcare system they cannot be treat , so they never get less dangerous , but they cannot be detain , so the public cannot be protect from them . furthermore it seem it be not unreasonable to detain people who you have good ground to suspect could be dangerous a we already detain potentially dangerous people who do not have mental health problem anyway , if authority believe they may be terrorist . 1 
counterpoint : dspd be not a psychiatric diagnosis , but a legal category therefore it be not surprising that it cannot be treat . it be a convenient label , however , for people whom the government fear and would like to have an excuse to detain , and who be unlikely to generate strong public sympathy . rather than demonise and detain people , the government should be provide mental health service which work in partnership with the people they be suppose to be help . 
point : people who be mentally ill be significantly more of a danger to themselves than to others with only 5 of homicide be commit by people with mental illness . 1 detention be one way of prevent people suffer from mental illness to harm themselves or anyone else , and this must be in the best interest of the patient . some people who be mentally unwell may attempt to commit suicide or get catch up in a cycle of self deprecate thought . however , patient in detention can be monitor ; therefore similarly to the issue of argument one , it seem important to detain patient in order to save them from themselves . 
counterpoint : detention can never truly be in the patient's interest . detention have be know to have damaging effect on mental health1 and thus be perhaps the bad thing that could be do for the individual . the fact that dspd be not a treatable condition mean that people describe a have it will , once detain , effectively be abandon they will not be able to be offer alternative treatment which might improve their condition and make their release more likely . unlike other detain psychiatric patient , their detention have no clear goal and it be difficult to see how anyone could argue for their release on the ground of improvement . 
point : the 2007 british mental health act1 be actually create partly in order to update the mental health act 1983 so that it conform to current human right law . the process of section ensures this by have two separate doctor diagnose the patient a both mentally ill and a threat to themselves or others ; these diagnosis be then present to an independent amp approve medical practitioner who make the decision about whether or not the individual can be detain . if a doctor or amp believe this should be extend to 28 day , then the process be repeat again independently . therefore they should be no concern about these detention violate anyone's human right . 
counterpoint : pre emptive indefinite detention be potentially in breach of the echr and the human rights act . article 5 right to liberty and security , article 6 right to a fair trial and article 8 right to respect for private and family life be all threaten by the proposals1 . it be best to avoid make legislation which the european court of human rights will rule to be illegal ; it be best to avoid make legislation which breach human right in any case .
