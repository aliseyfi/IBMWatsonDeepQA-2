point : in many western democracy , voter turnout have be fall while voter apathy appear to be rise . in the uk , voter turnout fell sharply between 1997 2000 , and the last general election in 2010 saw only 65 of potential voter cast a vote 1 . in the usa , the federal election of 2010 saw only 37 . 8 of potential voter cast their vote 2 . voter turnouts across europe follow this trend 3 . when so few people participate in the key act of democracy voting for the political leader of the country it begin to raise worrying question about the legitimacy of that democracy in the first place . if electronic or internet voting be introduce a an option alongside more traditional polling method , it would expand the accessibility of the voting system in general . internet or electronic voting would be a strategic practical measure . it would make voting convenient for busy modern citizen because it minimalises the amount of effort each individual have to contribute namely , they do not have to travel to the polling station 4 . as such , it remove physical restriction on the voting process and become more universally accessible . this would prevent people from be unable to vote because they be too busy 5 whether this be simply because their local polling station be too far away for them to commute to , or to fit in alongside their other daily responsibility base at work or home 6 7 . 
counterpoint : voter apathy cannot be solely attribute to have to walk to your local polling station . it can also be attribute to general disillusionment with the campaign political party , and the idea that none of them will perform well in government 1 . political party which focus more strongly on national rather than constituency campaigning can also inspire voter apathy 2 . the problem behind voter apathy be far great than can be solve by try to change the practical aspect of voting ; it be the fact that voter often feel neglect by their government which be a far great concern 3 . 
point : in modern , developed country , many people spend both work and leisure time on the internet or use electronic device 1 2 3 4 . our traditional voting system , with polling station and paper slip , be out of line with how many of the population now live their life . when we see an overwhelming number of people especially young people 5 vote for reality television programme such a the x factor 6 , it demonstrate a valuable method of engagement which the political system be miss out on . this have lead to source such a the bbc darkly questioning is big brother really more popular than election ? 7 , indicate that while the overall number of vote in the 2005 general election in the uk outweigh those cast for big brother and fame academy , the proportion of vote by young voter 18 34 could be understand to show more engagement with these television show than with the general election 8 . in any case , it be clear that we should bring our vote system up to date in order to engage young people and the wide population . 
counterpoint : our political situation be not as dire a this point make it seem ; it be easy to manipulate statistic between voting and reality television by discount the fact that many people who vote in television show vote multiple time often as many a ten 1 . young people be not completely detach from the political or the non electronic world . many be passionate about politics and exercise their right to vote 2 . low voter turnout be a general trend across the nation , and if young people be fail to vote then this too reflect disillusionment with government . for example , many young people who vote for the liberal democrats in the uk recently be shock when he expressly go against his promise to prevent tuition fee rise 3 . political disillusionment among young people be also a problem in the usa 4 and europe 5 . it be the state of politics itself , rather than the literal process of voting , which deter people from full political participation . 
point : because it would not require manual counting and tallying , remote electronic voting would allow the result to be know much faster 1 , and would also eliminate the potential for human error , which be a common problem with the current system 2 . for example , in the wisconsin supreme court election of 2011 , a clerk discover around 14 , 000 unrecorded vote which have be miss by human error and actually change the outcome of the election 3 . the clerk be now be question regard her party allegiance under suspicion that she be try to turn the election into a victory for her favoured candidate 4 yet another potential for abuse under the current system . machines , of course , be impartial concern party allegiance and so eliminate the potential for individual corruption . 
counterpoint : voting machine be far from reliable in this instance . experts have express concern that hacker , software bug . . . or power outage could intentionally or accidentally erase or alter voting data record by the machine 1 . in this case , while the machine may be politically impartial , they be still subject to potential human corruption alongside the opportunity for technical fault and breakdown . electronic vote count machine error lead to almost 2 million ballot be disqualify in the 2000 usa election 2 . electronic voting system need a lot more work before we should even consider use them ; they certainly do not solve any problem currently raise by manual counting . 
point : electronic voting would also save a great deal of money which be currently spend on employ counter and rent venue to be use a polling station . for example the uk general election in 2005 cost over 80 million to organise 1 , canada s 2008 election cost around 300 million 2 , and the usa presidential election of 2008 be estimate to cost up to 5 . 3 billion 3 . electronic voting also bring the opportunity to increase access to those who currently find it difficult to register their vote ; for example , electronic voting could be conduct in a minority language for those who find english difficult 4 . in the past , trial of this have be show to improve voter turnout among minority group 5 . electronic voting could also benefit the elderly , a many find it difficult to use the lever operate ballot currently in use . 6 using electronic voting ensures that no group be leave out of an essentially democratic process . 
counterpoint : the elderly far more frequently find electronic voting to be a hindrance rather than a help . those who be partially sight be unable to see the position on the text block on the screen ; small control such a button or touch screen create problem ; and some cognitively impaired people may find it difficult to remember a pin number which be use to authenticate the vote 1 . a simple paper ballot be a far more commonly recognise and straightforward method . in term of cost , the electronic voting machine or vote programme would certainly cost a great deal to implement and run 2 . ultimately , the great risk that electronic voting machine or system will lose vote 3 outweighs the cost argument : you cannot put a price on a crucial process at the core of every democratic state . 
point : our online security be improve every day ; people feel safe enough to trust their most important detail , such a bank detail , to the internet 1 why not their vote ? secure software and encryption protocol have allow online market to flourish , with company such a paypal inspire a sense of security among their customer 2 . any software for remote electronic voting could be scrutinise well in advance . it also remove the potential for identity fraud , which be a problem with current postal voting system 3 . each voter could be give a unique password , if necessary alongside something like a special swipe card , ensure that everybody who be entitle to vote get a single vote . given that in many jurisdiction , traditional polling station do not require voter to provide id 4 , it would arguably be a security improvement on the current situation . 
counterpoint : the most secure of website have be recently hack . for example , paypal be hack by lulzsec in response to the wikileaks scandal 1 . lulzsec also hack the us central intelligence agency cia 2 , supposedly the source of all their national intelligence and top secret information . if anything , recent event have show u that the internet be an unstable medium for people to conduct personal or professional affair ; we certainly should not allow our vote system to become even more vulnerable to this kind of attack . a good way to prevent identity fraud would be the simple measure of now require poll station to ask for id , rather than go to the extreme of online voting .
