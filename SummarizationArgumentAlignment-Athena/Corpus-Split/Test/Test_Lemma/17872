point : north korea be virtually the definition of a rogue state . it remain technically at war with the south and frequently this manifest itself in act of aggression . in any other situation the regime bombing of yeonpyeong island would have be consider an act of war and meet with a military response 1 . the regime s relentless pursuit of nuclear weaponry pose a very real threat . the regime have test missile at least capable of reach tokyo and seoul and have indicate a desire to be able to reach washington , 2 james cartwright , vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff be worry that they will be able to hit the west coast within a few year . 3 it seem reasonable to assume that , with the limited resource of the state be spend on these two goal , rather than feed the people , the regime will ultimately succeed in their ambition . waiting until they can actually bomb north america or europe would make kim jong un or his successor far too secure . although it seem unlikely that he would ever mount an attack with conventional weapon , access to an appropriate delivery system and a nuclear warhead would make his removal by military mean virtually impossible . removing him from office before this happen be essential for the security of the region and the world . 
counterpoint : north korea may well be a dangerous state with an unstable leader but neither the regime nor the nation be suicidal . there may be a large military but it simply lack the resource to mount an invasion . 
point : although the regime in pyongyang have express an interest in a reunified country , progress have be painfully slow . it take twelve year to get from initial contact to the first meeting . it seem likely that any suggestion of reunification be more a negotiate ploy than emblematic of any serious commitment . 
counterpoint : there be no appetite for , and little interest in , the outside world in the north . those reunion that have be organise have be establish by the south . as far a the citizen of the north be concern they be live in a utopia that be the envy of the world . there be little evidence that north koreans be clamour for reunification , although there be some appetite for it in the south , it be diminish a the generation that remember a united country die and the young generation take a look at the cost of do so . 
point : there be grind poverty in the north as well a brutal repression and all the other trapping of a military dictatorship . the only alternative future for the north be of a failed state go economically and socially in the opposite direction from the rest of eastern asia but now arm with nuclear weapon . 
counterpoint : although the famine in north korea be now an annual fixture and be routinely exacerbate by the regime whimsical refusal to accept food aid , it be difficult to see how the situation would be improve by what would probably be a long and protracted war follow by permanent unemployment .
