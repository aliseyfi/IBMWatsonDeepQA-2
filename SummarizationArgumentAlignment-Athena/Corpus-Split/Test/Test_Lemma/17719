point : the debt of many develop country be force upon them at the time of , and often a a condition of , independence . colonial power thus place extensive amount of their own debt on the shoulder of their former territory . for example , the netherlands force indonesia in 1949 to accept a a condition of independence the entirety of the colonial government's debt , itself the result of mercantilist exploitation by the mother country and the high cost of fight the indonesian rebel who struggle for independence for four year . france impose a similarly high cost on haiti in exchange for independence1 . forcing a new nation to effectively pay for the exploitation they suffer as well a for the soldier and weapon that kill their own countryman be manifestly unjust . left with little wherewithal to pay , it be only right to cancel the debt owe by these country . 1 jubilee debt campaign . 2011 . haiti . 3 
counterpoint : in most case there be no force in the assumption of debt by former colony , and only a small part , if any , of the debt of most develop country be the result of condition meted out by colonialist state . in any case , it be necessary to consider the cost incur by the colonizer , namely that they in many case provide extensive security benefit to the colony , bring education and western style infrastructure and institution . it seem unreasonable to suggest they be bar from seek a form of remuneration for these benefit provide . furthermore , because of the fact that such a small part of the develop world's debt be a hangover from the colonial era , cancel all of the debt make no sense , and cancel only the small part represent by that legacy would do little to relieve their overall debt burden . cancelling develop world debt on this basis be thus unfounded . 
point : cancelling debt and the interest payment these debt entail be the easy way of help the poor country develop . the cancellation of the debt would only apply to government to government debt and debt to the big international institution such a the world bank so there be relatively few actor who need to agree to the cancellation . as the cancellation would be do between government it would be easy to target which country get debt cancellation , this would mean the poor and most in need but could potentially mean exclude country where the windfall will simply mean prop up a regime that be brutalize it own people . the imf and world bank could look at country on a case by case basis to see which country be most deserving and where the cancellation would have great benefit . the actual cancellation of the debt would then be relatively simple , the government would simply accept that they be never go to be repay and take the debt off their book . 
counterpoint : cancelling debt it not the best way of help the poor , it simply result in give mismanaged country more money to waste . the poor country in the world be often the poor either because of very high level of economic mismanagement or through conflict . in neither case should we be help those in charge of pay off the debt get off the hook . the money save will not trickle down to the poor that really need it . instead extra money should be use a aid which can then be much well target . 
point : because of the often insurmountable debt burden lay on them , develop country be force to spend much of their economic resource on service the interest on their debt , rarely make much progress on reduce the principal , and thus lock themselves into a perpetual cycle of poverty1 . for example , due to their debt burden most african state pay four time as much on interest payment a they do on healthcare . structural readjustment programs institute by the imf in some country in order to reschedule debt payment have actually lead to backslide in quality of education , health , and welfare . furthermore , develop country often devote resource to production of cash crop for sale in the developed world rather than on food crop . the perverse incentive create by the need to pay off crush debt have lead many people in agriculturally fertile country to starve . by cancel debt , these country have a chance to invest in their own future and devote resource to long term development , rather than persistent debt repayment . 1 : jubilee debt campaign . 2008 . expanded debt cancellation : a key tool to fight global poverty . 6 
counterpoint : debt burden be far from the most serious cause of poverty and death in the developing world . mismanagement by government , corruption , and war be rife in many country without relation to debt burden . irrespective of this , however , there be no moral ground for cancel debt just because it make life well in these country . it be the fault of the indebted state that it take loan it would find difficult to repay ; it be a problem they have bring on themselves and do not absolve them from the responsibility of repayment . also , the moral hazard create by cancel debt may teach develop country the wrong lesson , encourage them to take on further debts1 . 1 krugman , paul . 2009 . the return of depression economics and the crisis of 2008 . new york : w . w . norton . 
point : debts that be incur by regime for purpose other than the benefit of the country be call odious debt . such debt be hold by many legal theorist , like alexander sack and patricia adams , to be ethically unenforceable . expecting a government to pay back the debt accrue by a tyrant or dictator to finance their own self enrichment be an unjust practice , a the people of the state , and the present regime , have not benefit fully , or at all , from the debt incur in their name . rather , a such tyrannical regime make little distinction between the personal holding of the dictator and those of the state , the debt accrue by him should be consider personal , not public debt . an example of the debt burden create by dictator be the case of haiti , where jean claude duvalier , dictator from 1971 to 1986 , pursue a policy of mass corruption and self enrichment , take on foreign loan to finance his own lavish lifestyle and the repression of the haitian people . 40 of haiti's current debt be the result of duvalier's corruption1 . to expect the democratic government of haiti to pay for these excess be entirely unjust and only compound to the harm already inflict by the dictatorship . clearly , state that lend money to such tyrant cannot justly attempt to extract payment from successor regime , consider that the loan they make often helped keep repressive dictator in power . 1 : committee for the abolition of third world debt . 2011 . repay historic debts to haiti . 7 
counterpoint : countries cannot be hold accountable for do business with dictator , especially when they be the only legitimate ruler of a territory . investor state cannot be expect to hold back on their own essential investment abroad because of the nature of the government they have to deal with . there be many different kind of government structure in the world ; try to assert that only one kind may have legitimate claim for repayment of debt make against them undermine the fabric of international relation and the acceptance of the world's multicultural and multi institutional nature . furthermore , acknowledge regime change a a legitimate ground for debt cancellation encourage instability in develop country and promote the risk of coup and revolution . groups will seek regime change in order to escape their debt burden , lead to massive unrest and volatility . for these reason , state , irrespective of government type or regime change , must be hold liable for their debt .
