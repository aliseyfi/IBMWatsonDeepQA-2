point : prisoners have be detain at guantanamo for long period without clear charge be file and without trial . this be a violation of the international legal principle of habeas corpus . one of the primary problem be that , without clear charge and a presentation of evidence against a suspect , the suspect cannot contest the charge and prove their own innocence . and , a a matter of fact , numerous detainee have be find innocent , but only after excessively long period without be charge or bring before a court . 1 
counterpoint : reforms can always be make to the legal process at guantanamo , and so this be not a reason to close the facility or to try the detainee in us court . moreover , much of the credible and reliable evidence that justify the continued detention cannot be admit in us court for legal reason , such a the fact that those capture in afghanistan and elsewhere be not read their miranda right on their arrest . other case involve evidence that be insufficient for trial but still sufficient to determine that release be an unacceptable security risk . 1 furthermore , if transfer to u . s . court , some of the detainee might be free because of the aggressive interrogation technique use against them . mohammed al qahtani , the allege 20th hijacker in the sept . 11 plot , be interrogate so severely at guantanamo bay that bush administration official say he be torture and do not refer his case for prosecution . 2 
point : the existence of guantanamo bay be cite by terrorist a a tool of the great satan and be see by muslims in general a a demonstration of us disregard for their dignity . it be , in turn , an effective tool use by terrorist and jihadists to bring recruit on board . the highly unpopular existence of guantanamo bay also make it more risky for intelligence source to come out and provide useful information that they might otherwise be willing to provide . this be because , for many muslims , guant√°namo stand a a confirmation of the low regard in which they believe the united states hold them . 1 some of this stem from the association of detention at guantanamo with the specifically anti islamic abuse which have reportedly occur there , such a allegation of have a guard dog carry the koran in it mouth , guard scrawl obscenity inside korans , kick korans across the floor , urinate on the koran , ridicule the koran , walk on the koran , and tear off the cover and throw the koran into trash or dirty water . 2 these association not only make it easy for terrorist to recruit by incite anti american sentiment , but also harm the us' ability to argue that the war on terror be not direct against all muslims . president obama announce in 2009 that close the guantanamo bay detention centre would allow the us to reclaim the moral high ground and thus well prosecute the war on terror . 3 '' 
counterpoint : guantanamo bay didn't create anti americanism in the islamic world . al qaeda exist and carry out 9 11 before guantanamo bay be establish , so it be unlikely that close the detention centre would make any of those who hate the us now reconsider . furthermore , close the facility could be see a a propaganda victory for the us' enemy , and far embolden terrorist organisation . 
point : un reports indicate that the treatment of detainee since their arrest , and the condition of their confinement , have have profound effect on the mental health of many of them . the treatment and condition include the capture and transfer of detainee to an undisclosed overseas location , sensory deprivation and other abusive treatment during transfer ; detention in cage without proper sanitation and exposure to extreme temperature ; minimal exercise and hygiene ; systematic use of coercive interrogation technique ; long period of solitary confinement ; cultural and religious harassment ; denial of or severely delayed communication with family ; and the uncertainty generate by the indeterminate nature of confinement and denial of access to independent tribunal . these condition have lead in some instance to serious mental illness , over 350 act of self harm in 2003 alone , individual and mass suicide attempt and widespread , prolonged hunger strike . the severe mental health consequence be likely to be long term in many case , create health burden on detainee and their family for year to come . 1 such condition be clearly not acceptable to a nation such a the us which pride itself on it justice system and respect for human right . the detention centre must be close to the us can end it association with such practice . 
counterpoint : it be possible to reform treatment at guantanamo bay without close the facility . the condition in the facility have in fact greatly improve since it establishment and in many way differ from the public's negative perception of it . 1 but even if in fact these negative report of the condition at guantanamo be true , it be likely that many of those detain at guantanamo may not be even more anti american than when they arrive , so release them could mean they pose an even great threat to the us .
