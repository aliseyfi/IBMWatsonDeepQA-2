point : under develop area of urban environment can be reinvigorate and repopulated through the demolition of low rise project and their replacement with high rise complex . such regeneration drive both interest and footfall into area , foster an economy within an economy in the area . we can learn from the mistake that western europe and the us make in the past , for example by ensure that there be job opportunity and shop locate near the high rise development to sustain that interest and encourage resident to stay in the area . several recent publication on high rise housing scheme emphasize the importance of resident be there by choice as well a low child density , but if these factor be in place , success be likely1 . turning a decrepit area into a safe , booming and high rise neighbourhood therefore remove the eye sore of a poor , low rise slum and replaces it with the community and activity that high rise housing provide . this increase the happiness of resident , stimulates economic activity in the area and keep child busy and away from harmful influence . 
counterpoint : regeneration require more than just housing development , it require sufficient interest to draw people to the area . high rise offer no such incentive ; a danish philosopher jan gehl be quote a say , 'above the fifth floor you're not part of the earth anymore , because you can't see what's go on on the ground and the people on the ground can't see where you are'1 . though hyperbolic , the sentiment be correct , the mean to draw community together be not to separate them vertically from the area itself and each other . the most famous example be that of pruitt igoe in st . louis ; build a part of the post war regeneration , it be complete in 1956 but be demolish just fourteen year later after be beset by disrepair , vandalism and crime2 . for family with child , the high rise complex do not offer them respite from poverty or crime , but merely gather the ingredient for it together in one place . if area regeneration be desire , what be require be step intend to entice people into the area , not simply move them there and hope that will thereafter improve the neighbourhood . cause and effect be misplace . 
point : urban sociability can be promote by high rise housing that encourage chance meeting with neighbour through the sharing of mutual facility , often in social setting . as such , they offer a distinct contrast with increasingly anti social modern society . architect lawrence nield argue in modern city one leave home in an air condition car , arrive in the parking space beneath the office , and then go by elevator to the office floor . there be very little chance for deliberate or accidental contact . there be little urban sociability 1 . a high rise complex , in contrast , accord to architect carl fender , occupy very little land , so you get a lot of people closer in to the facility such a theatre , reception , garden and you have safety and amenity 1 . socializing be implicitly encourage in order to offset the disadvantage of those share space , the peace and serenity of a private garden in a residential house be offset by the social atmosphere of share facility . 
counterpoint : urban sociability be drive by our character , not choice of housing . the nature of life in an urban environment be that there be people everywhere ; if we be not social elsewhere in an urban environment , it be unlikely the omnipresence of people or festivity in a high rise complex will encourage u to be more social . as allan davies point out , there be a misconception that 'merely be expose to stranger and neighbour be an important determinant of the quality of depth of human interaction' 1 . urban sociability may be affect by proximity to others , but it be undoubtedly ultimately drive by 'the richness of interaction not on something as trite a how many people be see in the street' davies , 2010 . generally speak , a architect philip goad describe 'living in a tall building might be just the same a be anonymous in the suburb , you can choose to be anonymous or you can choose to be part of a community'2 . 
point : it can be more environmentally friendly a it can save a lot of space and energy , much cheap to build than independent home and in many way easy to manage than the chaotic building and complex infrastructure , or lack thereof , that currently exist in slum and favelas . as develop lorenz grollo have state there be a 'better , greener outcome when you get a big mass on the one footprint'1 . the motivation for high population density also derive from a reduce need to travel which would in turn low energy consumption and pollution2 . 
counterpoint : high rise housing be not more environmentally friendly than traditional low rise housing . high rise building 'tend to be less environmentally efficient than low rises'1 , particularly in asian environment where the use of air condition unit lead to mass energy consumption2 . residents be prone to relax in collective environment whereby they feel the load be be share and their excess might be offset by another's sensibility . the personal onus on each individual to act responsibly to protect the environment be lose in such a communal setting . 
point : high rise housing be a successful housing solution when face with the problem of population growth and urban migration . urban migration , whereby population flock to urban centre look for work , leave city short on affordable housing , transport link and can either lead to inner city poverty or urban sprawl . high rise housing offer solution to both problem by maximise the number of people that can live on a scarce , fixed amount of available land . in london , where transport and affordable housing be major problem , 'new tower block offer a way of alleviate both problems'1 . in contrast , melbourne , where the population be expect to rise by 3 million people by 2050 , 'better use of available city land have be identify a a key to maintain melbourne's liveability , and halt urban sprawl'2 . 
counterpoint : solving the arithmetical problem housing a large number of people in a small space do not constitute a successful solution . quality of life be the key . high rise housing do not solve the problem of urban migration and urban sprawl . in fact , in many case , it appear to have exacerbate the problem for the city involve . in the wake of world war ii , a mass , system build production of housing produce a large quantity of housing that undoubtedly solve the problem of affordable housing but do little concern the quality of life within them1 . hartliffe estate in bristol , despite state of the art security system , have the high crime rate of those study in a recent study , demonstrate the inherent disadvantage of high rise live even with improvement design to curb crime1 . to successfully solve the problem of urban migration specifically , migrant need more than just to be funnel into project that inevitably breed poverty and crime .
