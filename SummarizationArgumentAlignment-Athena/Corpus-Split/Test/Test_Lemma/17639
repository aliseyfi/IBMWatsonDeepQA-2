point : many middle eastern state already have institution that be similar to the representative institution that a stable democracy need so can easily become the real thing . arab dictator have grow adept at hold election , set up parliament ; constitutional court etc . a window dress to show either to their people or to the outside world that they be reform and be democratic . no matter how undemocratic these regime have be the simple existence of these institution be useful when there be a revolution a they allow some continuity and the possibility of a transition to democracy . 
counterpoint : while the presence of pre exist institution be an advantage in transition to a democracy , that advantage may be compromise when these institution be largely see a illegitimate and have not foster a democratic political culture . key to the development of a democratic political culture be confidence in institution and a willingness to accept the popular will as carry out by those institution . 
point : egypt a the big arab state and one of only two so far that have have largely peaceful revolution be perhaps the best example of the progress that have be make . there be a referendum in egypt in march on amend the constitution that pass with a yes vote of 77 . 2 . that there be a referendum at all surely count a progress . it limit the number of presidential term to two , promise to strengthen the judiciary and abolish some of the emergency law . a turnout of 41 be not as good a it could have be but it be a great advance compare to other poll in recent egyptian history . mohamed ahmed attia , the chairman of the supreme judicial committee that supervise the election , explain it significance a be the first real referendum in egypt's history , we have an unprecedented turnout because after jan . 25 people start to feel that their vote would matter . 1 because egypt have historically be at the center of the arab world success in egypt will be vital to show that a stable arab democracy can be create . 
counterpoint : the referendum be not an example of progress . it be not hard to see why many of those who demonstrate in tahrir square be in the no camp for this referendum . the president remain extraordinarily powerful . the amendment do nothing about due process and neglect other authoritarian aspect of the state 1 the referendum be attack for not deal with large scale structural issue . leading opposition figure such a mohamed el baradei argue the referendum deal only with minutia . it doesn't talk about the imperial power of the president , it doesn't talk about the distortion of the parliament , it doesn't talk about the need to have an independent constituent assembly that represent everybody . so we be go to say no . 2 this mean that the institutional problem that help create an over mighty presidency and autocracy have remain in place . 
point : the economic , social , and political history of the region show there be many obstacle to establish stable democracy in the middle east . many in the west fear that islam be among these barrier , with claim that islamist party like the muslim brotherhood in egypt and ennahda in tunisia will turn their country into theocracy like iran . however , there be majority muslim state with islamist party that have succeed in create stable democracy , include turkey and indonesia . both country be good case study that disprove the widespread notion that islam be incompatible with democracy . 
counterpoint : while these example prove that in some iteration islam can work with democracy , it be likely that other factor make democracy viable in inodnesia and turkey . indonesia be free of the hostile relationship with the west that often undermine the stability of the middle east , and have benefit from a strong trade relationship . while the akp in turkey be islamist , it operate within the turkish constitution which require the military to dissolve any government that threaten the secular nature of the state . without a constitutionally define commitment to strict secularism , like in turkey , the islamist party in egypt and tunisia will resort to undemocratic practice .
