point : universities be now under what be perhaps the most serious financial pressure they have ever faced1 the uk government for example be cut spend on education by up to 25 2 and allow university to charge high tuition fee . shorter degree course will help to address these great pressure on all high education system . by move student through university more quickly , they free up capacity so that the increase demand for high education can be meet within exist resource . and a tuition fee rise in the uk3 and many other country a a consequence of government funding cut , student will benefit from short course that will allow them to graduate with less debt . 
counterpoint : higher education system be under pressure at present , but short degree course will not fix the problem . first of all , additional teaching week be not cost free a academic will demand more money for their increased work load and many of the resource use in a degree course e . g . book , field visit , chemical will be the same regardless of how the teaching be schedule . the university of buckingham make short course work by charge more for low tutor student ratio , which imply increase cost if this be scale up over the whole country . in addition , many poor student part fund their degree by work for 20 week or so in their vacations1 , so increase their term length may actually force them either to take on more debt than at present , or deter them from pursue high education in the first place . 
point : if modern student be not up to the demand of high education , they should not be go to university in the first place . the over expansion of high education in the last twenty year have inevitably lower standard among undergraduates1 , as well a impose great cost on taxpayer . a two year system would undoubtedly be more intensive , and come with considerably less time off than the current system . this would most likely discourage those who see university a simply 'something to do before get a job' , thus increase the value of a degree once more . 
counterpoint : suggesting that reduce the number of year for degree course implies that currently all course be too easy and give student too much time to do the work require . of course this be not the case achieve top mark in most course be still very difficult , and reduce the amount of study time would inevitably inhibit the ability of student to study beyond the basic parameter of their course , which be a key part of university education . geoffrey alderman argue in the guardian that there be many other problem with the current system which be unrelated to the number of student go through it , include the modern fixation with league table result . he argue that be be this toxic combination of factor that need to change , and reduce amount of time spend at university will not affect them1 . 
point : those who leave school at 16 or 18 but now want to go to college be often more serious about their study , often with a more motivated and professional approach than 19 or 20 year old who have move to university by default . we should seek to encourage such committed student , who often contribute a great deal to society and the economy upon their graduation . but mature student want focus , cost effective course that do not require them to take three or more year out of a career . for example , at stafford university where 2 year course be be trialed , director for academic development dr steve wyn williams have say that many of our student who opt to do the fast track be mature student who be look for a career change who be often quite use to work during the summer period when they be in employment 1 . it would seem then that the introduction of such course would encourage more mature student to get good qualification , and in the process be able to contribute more to the economy as well a learn more for themselves . 
counterpoint : making such significant alteration to the education system in order to good accommodate one fairly minor subset of student seem a little extreme . a study in america show that mature student over the age of 25 account for 36 of the total number of undergraduates1 , and although this be a significant proportion , it be nowhere near enough to consider change the entire university structure . in the uk the number of mature student may be even less , with 30 at oxford brookes classify a mature2 , and only 14 at university college london3 . beyond the simple case of number , it be also important to consider that even in the mature section of student , short degree course will not necessarily be good . part time course and training for those already with career be also widely available . 
point : by teach student for 40 week a year rather than less than 30 , the same amount of teach time can be provide so that student reach degree standard faster . the university of buckingham have show over many year that this can be achieve with no loss of quality they remain highly place in comparative league tables1 . at the same time laboratory and lecture theatre do not stand empty for half the year , while student still have 12 week of vacation in which they can read and reflect on their learning . 
counterpoint : academic institution be about more than churn out result if anything this de value the entire system to the detriment of those who be genuinely suit to real academic study . the fact remain that none of the most highly ranked university have make a move towards shorten their course , and while the university of buckingham have show that it can achieve similar result in less time , this do not automatically mean that the system be well . recently in britain the government have come under pressure to reduce the number of people go through the system a such a focus on number and statistic have , accord to a report by the association of graduate recruiters , driven down standard and devalue the currency of a degree and damage the quality of the university experience 1 .
