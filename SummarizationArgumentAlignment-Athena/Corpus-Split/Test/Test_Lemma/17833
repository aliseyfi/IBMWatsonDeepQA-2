point : tibet have a long history of independence go back more than 1500 year . even in time of chinese domination , tibetans largely govern themselves independently of the small number of chinese official in lhasa . 1 
counterpoint : in order for tibet to have traditionally be view a part of the chinese nation , there be no requirement that it have be under chinese rule continuously . like many other part of china , it be rule by china during time of imperial strength , and when government weaken , so too do central authority . in this sense tibet have a lot in common with manchuria , another region that tend to drift towards autonomy during time of dynastic weakness . 
point : due to systematic campaign of sinocization , million of han chinese have be encourage to settle in tibet , and with the support of the government they now dominate the economy and upper echelon of the administration . demographically tibetans be rapidly become a minority within their own country , and administratively this have already take place . 
counterpoint : migrations for economic reason be part of the modern global economy . tibet in 1950 be massively underdeveloped with very low literacy rate , and little modern economic infrastructure . given the determination of the chinese government to modernize tibet , the importation of worker be vital . educated chinese be need to run the administration in the absence of qualified local elite willing to work with them , while chinese teacher be need to run the school . in turn , they bring their family , and a host of business follow . 
point : an independent tibet would serve a useful purpose a a neutral and demilitarized buffer state between india and china . given the rise economic and military clout of both power , a future conflict be become ever more likely , and they already fight one war against one another in 1962 . 
counterpoint : on the contrary , this situation almost ensure that the tibetans will become a puppet of one or another foreign power . weak state almost invariably need ally to maintain their independence . an independent tibet , especially one that have inherit the history of the last sixty year would likely be dominate by politician who be militantly anti chinese , but would be too weak to defend itself against china . it would almost certainly become an indian proxy , a it only hope of survival would be to attempt to gain the support of the united states and india against china . 
point : tibet , and the resistance tibetans continue to show to chinese rule present a toxic domestic and international political problem that cost far more than it worth . domestically , violence in tibet be the most serious domestic disturbance face the chinese government , and the fact that there be nearly constant violence between han settlers and tibetans force the chinese to alienate everyone in order to contain it . furthermore , the economic and political disenfranchisement of the tibetan people be an enormous domestic problem , a it have lead to large number become unemployed and move to other part of china where they form an underclass . 
counterpoint : everything be comparative . the major reason why china do not face more serious domestic unrest be that it international and economic progress have allow it to appeal to chinese nationalism . withdrawing from tibet would be view a an act of weakness , one which would do far more to undermine the communist party s legitimacy and support base than remain there .
