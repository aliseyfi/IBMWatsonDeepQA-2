point : the main goal of this program be increase school enrollment overall . if it be too much to expect from family , then the program would have fail in the case that it be institute . however , the opposite have be the case . 12 . 4 million family in brazil be enrol in a program call bolsa familia where child s attendance in school be reward with 12 a month per child . the number of brazilians with income below 440 a month have decrease by 8 year since 2003 , and 1 6 of the poverty reduction in the country be attribute to this program 1 . additionally it be much less expensive than other program , cost only about . 5 of the country s gdp 2 . considering that this program have be affordable and successful in both reduce poverty and increase school enrollment it be worth use a an incentive in more program around the world . 
counterpoint : but the program in brazil be bias towards rural community versus city . in the two large city in only 10 of family be enrol versus 41 in the rural area of brazil 1 . to consider the program effective it need to work equally with all member of the poor , which it do not . 
point : parents on welfare benefit be the most likely to need the extra inducement . they generally tend to be less educated and oftentimes be less appreciative of the long term value of education . in the late 90's , 42 of people on welfare have less than a high school education , and another 42 have finish high school , but have not attend college in the us . therefore they need the additional and more tangible , financial reason to send their child to school . children living in poverty in the us be 6 . 8 time more likely to have experience child abuse and neglect1 . while attendance might not be a sufficient condition for academic success , it be certainly a necessary one , and the very first step toward it . some parent might be tempt to look at the short term cost and benefit . sending a child to school might be an opportunity cost for the parent a lose labor inside or outside the home especially in the third world the household , or a an actual cost , a pay for thing like supply , uniform or transportation can be expensive . around the world there be an estimated 158 million work child , who often need to work to contribute to their family's livelihood2 . in the uk it be estimate that send a child to public school cost up to 1 , 200 pound a year . if they lose money by not send child to school , this would tilt the cost benefit balance in favor of school attendance . 1 duncan , greg and brooks gunn , jeanne 2000 , family poverty , welfare reform , and child development , child development , accessed july 21 , 2011 3 2 http : www . unicef . org protection index_childlabour . html 4 http : www . unicef . org protection index_childlabour . html 5 accessed july 13 , 2011 . 
counterpoint : if school be so expensive , than shouldn't the government be subsidize school cost instead of force parent to send kid to school when they can't afford the book and clothes ? it be also unfair to assume that parent on welfare on neglectful and do not value education . supporting meal program in school and subsidize other cost be much more likely to draw child than force parent to send child to school when the kid be hungry and embarrassed1 . 1 united states department of agriculture , the school breakfast program , accessed july 21 , 2011 . 6 
point : when society have to step in and provide for those who've prove themselves unable to provide for themselves that should reasonably create certain expectation on the part of those be help . in almost every aspect of life , money be give in return for a product , service or behavior . it be the same with welfare payment ; money in exchange for child be put in school . we expect parent to do a good job in their role a parent . ensuring that their child attend school be a crucial part of parental responsibility . children on welfare in the us be 2 time more likely to drop out of school , however study have show that child who be part of early childhood education be more likely to finish school and remain independent of welfare1 . thus , when a parent be a welfare recipient , it be entirely reasonable to make it conditional on send their kid to school . if tax payers' dollar be be spend on those who cannot provide for themselves , there need to be a societal return . one of the great complaint about welfare be that people work hard for the money that they earn , which be then hand to others with no direct benefit to society . if child of people on welfare be in school it increase the likelihood that they will finish high school , maybe get a scholarship and go to college , and have the necessary tool to contribute to the work force and good society . 
counterpoint : the purpose of welfare be not to good society per se ; it be to support those who have fall into bad time and need extra help . expecting people to render a service in exchange for help be demean and it undermine the purpose of welfare which be to help people get back on their foot versus tell them what they have to do to be consider beneficial to society . 
point : in the us , girl who grow up in family receive welfare handout be 3 time more likely to receive welfare themselves within three year of have their first child than girl who's family be never on welfare1 . children living in poverty be 2 time more likely to have grade repetition and drop out of high school and 3 . 1 time more likely to have child out of wedlock a teenagers2 . they be 2 . 2 time more likely to experience violent crime . children of welfare recipient be more likely to end up on welfare themselves . welfare should be a hand up , not a handout that lead to dependency on the state . it be the latter if we be only lead people to fall into the same trap a their parent . education be the way to break the vicious cycle . through education , child will acquire the skill and qualification they need in order to obtain gainful employment once they reach adulthood , and overcome their condition . in the developing world , primary education have prove to reduce aids incidence , improve health , increase productivity and contribute to economic growth3 . school can empower child , and give them guidance and hope that they may not receive at home . getting kid in school be the first step to equip them with the skill to better their situation , and if encourage by their parent they might consider scholarship to college or vocational school . the program do not guarantee this for all , but it be likely more effective than the leave parent with no incentive to push their child . benefits be suppose to promote the welfare of both parent and child . one of the best way to ensure that welfare payment be actually benefit child be to make sure they're go to school . this be simply provide parent with an extra incentive to do the right thing for their child and become more vested in their kids' education . 1 family facts , a closer look at welfare , accessed july 21 , 2011 . 8 2duncan 3 , greg and brooks gunn , jeanne 2000 , family poverty , welfare reform , and child development , child development , accessed july 21 , 2011 3 3http world bank , facts about primary education , accessed july 21 , 2011 . 9 
counterpoint : just because student attend school do not mean that they be go to receive a quality education . the best educated child be those whose parent be involve heavily in their school , help them with their homework , and push them to excel1 . without involve parent , student can become just a easily discourage . there really need to be program to involve parent more in school , and provide good mentor and role model for student who don't have them . schools also need to be improve . just send kid to school doesn't mean that they be go to learn and be determine to well themselves . additionally particularly in the third world if child don't have good school and qualified teacher , then what be the point of go to school ? 1 chavkin , nancy , and williams , david 1989 , low income parents' attitudes toward parent involvemet in education , social welfare , accessed july 21 , 2011 . 10
