point : originally , nato have a clearly define purpose and a common enemy : the soviet bloc . with the demise of that share enemy , nato s original purpose have disappear but it well functioning military structure remain , leave it open to be seize by opportunistic politician in a classic case of scope creep . this have happen with u . s . president george bush jr . s push to let ukraine and georgia in a new member in his global campaign to spread democracy . this have only serve to increase tension with russia see next argument . who be to say that something similar isn t go to happen vi Ã  vi china ? 1 
counterpoint : continued existence of nato doesn t make the world less safe . with the collapse of the soviet union , it be only natural for the member of nato to have be try to define a new purpose . but discuss to define a new threat , whether that be an enemy state or a broad global security threat , isn t the same a create that threat . it s not nato s so call scope creep that make the world more unsafe , it be actual threat that make the world unsafe , and nato s formidable military structure can be useful in combat these . 1 
point : there be two issue keep russia cautious of nato a a military alliance . the first be a proposal by the u . s . to put up a missile defence system in poland , the czech republic and on warship in the black sea under the flag of nato to protect against missile from iran or north korea , which , accord to russia , would never fly over these country in any attack . russia conclude that the missile defence system therefore must be direct at them . the second issue be nato s plan to expand with ukraine and georgia , which russia have traditionally regard a part of their sphere of influence . as russian president medvedev state in 2008 : no state can be please about have representative of a military bloc to which it do not belong come close to it border . 1 
counterpoint : nato cooperate with russia to decrease tension . since 2002 , nato and russia have an on go dialogue to discuss strategic issue in the nato russia council . this council aim to enhance political consultation and practical cooperation with russia in area of shared interest with russia a a true strategic partner . 1 obviously , political difference over specific issue remain : nato stress georgia s and ukraine s sovereignty and maintain an open door policy for their membership if they themselves want this . what matter be that through this on go , institutionalized dialogue , nato make clear it see russia a a strategic partner , and possibly even a a future member , not a a potential enemy . 
point : the clause that an attack against one mean an attack against all article v run the risk of entangle the entire alliance in an unwanted conflict . this have happen before : world war i start out a a local conflict between the austro hungarian empire and serbia , but through their security alliance inadvertently draw in all the major power of the world . given that many member of nato have unstable country near their border i . e . turkey border iraq there be a risk they could become involve in a small regional war , which then inadvertently draw in the entire world . 
counterpoint : nato have sufficient safeguard to prevent accidental escalation . article v indeed specify that member commit themselves to assist a fellow member when attack , but this clause leave enough room to remain on the safe side . first of all , the clause be only defensive , to ensure that nato doesn t become involve in a war of choice of any of it member , like the gulf war . secondly , article v allow member to choose their assistance in proportion to the actual security threat and accord to their own mean and goal , instead of the automatic trigger that lead to world war i . 
point : maintaining an administration for nato , with personnel and building , cost money . moreover , whenever nato member engage in a mission , they re suppose to fund their activity under these mission themselves . 1 given that the original threat have pass and give that the organisation still struggle to redefine itself , why spend money on it ? 
counterpoint : nato do not cont too much it save money . through joint exercise and share intelligence , member state learn to cooperate and communicate more effectively with each other , save effort when , if ever , they be force to cooperate . these benefit alone be worthwhile . moreover , defence contractor could expect a large , more unified market , thus drive down average cost per unit , because of nato s effort in standardize requirement .
