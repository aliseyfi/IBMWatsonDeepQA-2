point : flying be a major source of pollution and , in particular , of greenhouse gas such a carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide . the role of aircraft in climate change be worsen by the high altitude at which gas and particulate be release into the atmosphere . it be think that the impact of aircraft emission on our climate be two or three time great than that of the same amount of co2 when release by vehicle on the ground1 . at present , aviation fuel be largely free from taxation . most country do not tax it for internal journey , and international treaty prevent taxation of fuel use for international flight . for these reason , aviation fuel kerosene , a fossil fuel should be tax , in order to make the polluter pay for the damage they cause , and to encourage a reduction in the amount of emission . 
counterpoint : the aviation industry recognize the impact of aircraft emission on the climate , although the extent of the damage compare to other us of fossil fuel be still uncertain . led by the international civil aviation organization icao , the industry be make considerable progress towards reduce emission . engines be become more efficient and so be flight procedure , allow fuel to be use more efficiently . icao pollution standard have be progressively tighten for a range of different emission . as a result , emission per passenger kilometer have be reduce by 70 over the past forty year . research suggest that co2 production can be halve by 2020 a airline update their fleet of aircraft and technology continue to improve1 . given this voluntary progress and the continue effort of airline and aerospace company , taxation be unnecessary . 
point : a tax on aviation fuel could certainly be put into effect on an international basis . climate change be a global problem and the icao be task in the kyoto protocol to look at how the aviation industry worldwide could reduce emission . as it be in the interest of all country to tackle aircraft emission , an international consensus could certainly be achieve give effort . agreements on other difficult issue have be reach in the past e . g . the millennium development goals , anti landmine treaty , the montreal climate change conference in 2005 . 
counterpoint : a tax on aviation fuel would be impractical and impossible to put into action . attempts to place a tax on fuel by individual state will fail , a airline can easily obtain fuel more cheaply elsewhere . and if individual country raise the cost of fly to and from their airport , they will lose income from tourist and business traveller to other state . trying to put a global tax in place will also fail international treaty actually make it illegal to tax aviation fuel the 1944 chicago convention1 , reinforce by many bilateral air service agreements and there be no international consensus for change . 
point : taxing aviation fuel would encourage great fuel economy by make kerosene more expensive . as the popularity of air travel continue to increase rapidly , it be important to put pressure on the aviation industry to use fuel as efficiently a possible , in order to hold emission down as much as much a they be able to . with fossil fuel reserve run out , fuel conservation be also a wise use of finite resource . more expensive fuel would give airline an incentive to adopt the most modern technology and update their fleet . they could also adopt fly practice aim at maximize fuel efficiency , such a fly at low speed . 
counterpoint : airlines already have a price incentive to maximize fuel efficiency , so a tax on fuel be unnecessary . fuel be a major cost item for all airline and , a the price of fossil fuel have soar over the past few year , extra pressure have be put on airline to change their practice and adopt new technology in order to survive . both boeing and airbus have respond to this market demand by produce new aircraft with much low emission per passenger , and airline be already order them in large numbers1 . compared to the large market swing in price for aviation fuel , a tax would have little additional impact . 
point : a tax on aviation would be international in scale and provide an excellent opportunity to raise money for development aid . the european union be consider such a plan in order to provide additional funding to ensure it millennium development goals target will be meet . france , germany , brazil and chile be already call for such an initiative , and france already unilaterally introduce a levy on flight in 2006 to go to meet the mdgs1 . in the long term , a global tax on aviation could be administer by the united nations , provide it with a regular , predictable income safe from political interference . greater un control over development aid will also overcome current problem of duplication , favoritism and waste in compete national program . setting revenue from aviation aside to fund international aid will make a tax more acceptable to passenger , and will spread the burden of aid funding more fairly around the world . 
counterpoint : unless a tax on aviation be so high that it damage the airline industry , it be unlikely to meet the need for development aid . countries have already make commitment to fund the millennium development goals mdgs and they should be prepare to meet their promise out of their domestic budget , rather than experiment with an untested gimmick . there be a danger that if politician and voter feel international aid have it own tax , they will stop funding it from regular taxation . there be also serious question about accountability and administration national aid budget be already much more likely to be well run than the program of undemocratic international institution such a the un and the eu . finally , hypothecation of revenue money raise by a particular tax spent on only one thing be in itself harmful . there be no reason to think that the need for development aid will go up or down with the economic fortune of the airline industry . if another terrorist attack like 9 11 take place or there be an international disease outbreak such a sars or avian flu , aviation could be badly hit once more . with such a tax , few flight would mean less money generate towards development aid .
