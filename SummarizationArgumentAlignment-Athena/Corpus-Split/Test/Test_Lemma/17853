point : scrapping earmark will save billion of dollar and contribute to reduce the appal us budget deficit . earmarks total about 16 billion of the 2009 10 budget , 1 unnecessary spending which should be cut in the interest of both present and future us taxpayer . earmarks can be a large amount of a department s budget , in 2005 the office of naval research derive a quarter of it budget through earmark . 2 granted , remove earmark alone will not be sufficient to eliminate the budget deficit and get rid of wasteful government spending , but earmark be the obvious place to start . until these most egregious example of waste be tackle , it will not be possible to move on to cut big spending program . 
counterpoint : scrapping earmark win t save money , it s just a distraction from the real challenge the government face . as earmarks be just a way of describe a government fund program 1 they do not represent additional government spending , they simply appropriate small amount of it less than 0 . 5 of the whole us budget , and only 1 . 5 of discretionary spending for specific project . 2 if the earmark be not there , the money would still be spend ; it use would simply be decide by the executive branch rather than direct to a particular end by congress . for this reason , end the use of earmark will do nothing to cut the deficit . if you be serious about do that you would have to think about cut entitlement program such a medicare and medicaid , raise the pension age far , reduce military expenditure , and increase tax . 3 
point : earmarks usually represent expensive program of little worth to the american people . as the main mean of pork barrel politics , earmark be typically vanity project with little economic benefit . examples include the alaskan bridge to nowhere a 400 million project to connect an island community of just 50 people to the mainland , 1 1 million for shuttle bus at western kentucky university , 2 and a grant of 300 000 for the polynesian voyaging society of hawaii . 3 worse , a recent harvard business school study find that state which receive the most federal spending via earmark from well connect congressmen actually suffer economically a a result , because the federal money crowd out private investment and distort the local job market . 4 
counterpoint : there will always be some wasted spending but earmark often appropriate money for project that be consider very worthwhile by the local community . 1 after all , representative know that useless vanity project will not attract positive headline back home , so they have every incentive to ensure that the money go into stimulate local economy , invest in neglected community , and make a positive impact on the life of million of americans . 2 for example senator mccain single out 6 . 6million for research on formosan termite a unjustified but for local people they represent a threat to building a they consume wood . 3 furthermore , who be more likely to appreciate the need on the ground , a faceless , unaccountable washington base bureaucrat , or an elected local representative closely in touch with the need of their constituent ? as rahm emanuel argue i know more about the need of the people i represent than some bureaucrat in washington , an ideologue in the white house , or bad , a bureaucrat with order from a white house ideologue . 4 finally , if there be some worthless example of earmark , then by all mean eliminate those through scrutiny and vote in congress on a case by case basis . there be no need to abandon the whole system . 
point : the use of earmark erodes trust in politician and the federal government for two reason . first , it reinforce a belief that politician ignore the wide national interest but be simply out for themselves , scrabble to channel a much federal pork a possible back home in order to aggrandise themselves and ensure re election . second , it assume that the answer to every local problem or issue be for the federal government to raise yet more tax revenue and bestow it from on high because washington know best . it be a symbol that make it hard to resist spending both for politician and their constituent . 1 
counterpoint : what erode trust in congress be the endless squabbling between party who put their own partisan advantage over the national interest , not the lobbying of individual representative and senator on behalf of their constituent . politicians erode trust by loudly argue that government be the problem . 1 earmarks be in fact important in link congress to citizen , a they produce concrete benefit at a local level that can be associate with the activity of elect official . this increase trust and help to legitimise the wider activity of the federal government , include it tax . this help to explain why opinion poll find that most people trust their own congressman to do the right thing , even a confidence in congress a a whole sink to record low . 2 
point : the ability to support or withhold approval from earmark strengthen the party leadership in congress too much . effectively the leadership can bribe elect representative with pork for their state or district in order to get them to vote for flawed legislation or budget . this be clearly see in the 2010 healthcare bill where in the senate vote be secure from conservative democrats by offer federal spending or subsidy that only affect the state of louisiana and nebraska . 1 one consequence of the temptation provide by earmark be poor policy making , but more broadly it discourage congressmen from think and vote independently , accord to their conscience and their belief in what be best for the nation . 
counterpoint : some observer would argue that congress suffers from a lack of party unity , rather than too much of it , and that anything that help the leadership to deliver on their party s campaign promise be of value . so the promise of earmark be part of the normal give and take of legislative politics , often allow a representative to ameliorate the adverse impact of a policy at a local level and allow necessary bill to be pass . 1 however , even if you think this be bad , eliminate earmark will not get rid of undue influence on voting in congress . instead it will hand that power to the executive , with the white house be able to offer incentive to waver congressmen to get them to vote for it program in the form of promise about increased spending on project in their state or district . 
point : earmarks be fundamentally unfair , benefit some state and congressional district much more than others regardless of the merit of their case for federal spending . where spending priority be decide by the executive they can set objective criterion and organise competitive bidding process for specific project . earmarks avoid this merit base approach and instead channel money to specific project accord to how well connect their congressional representative be . 1 congressmen on the key spending committee , especially the appropriations committees , be best place to channel pork back to their district . it have be find that earmark spending rise between 40 50 in a state if one of it senators become chair of a top three committee . 2 
counterpoint : all spending benefit some state over others , all that depend be the actor who be decide on where the money go . if spending be equal per person then it can be accuse of not be progressive or benefit state that need it more . if it be make by some other method then it will always favor some over others . it be right that those who be determine where money be go should be elect representative rather than a bureaucrat or a simple formula .
