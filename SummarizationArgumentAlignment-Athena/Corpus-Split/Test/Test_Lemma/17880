point : in a modern warfare scenario , the vast majority of combat take place in civilian area , such a city . whilst cluster bomb be obviously not use for peacekeeping purpose they be use in initial assault on these area , particularly against large formation of enemy troop . this mean that due to the indiscriminate nature of cluster bomb , in the same way a with land mine , often both military and civilian target be encompass in the blast radius . this be what happen in zagreb a martic be target croat force but the attack due to the use of cluster weapon also kill civilian . 
counterpoint : cluster bomb , when use sensibly be use in uninhabited area to take down military personnel . they be only intend for military target and collateral damage when attack military target be something that be accept a a regrettable problem in war . 
point : the international legal system be dependent on be robust and transparent in order for it to be respect by country and state that accept it . the refusal by the u . s . to ban cluster bomb prevent the international community from do the same within international law a the u . s . have enough political power that should it choose to ignore the law , the law itself be consider to be irrelevant . 
counterpoint : the international legal system already have many grey area and often thing that should be ban be not because of objection by certain country despite their similarity to other item that be ban . a change regard cluster bomb be not realistically go to make more people accept the international legal system . 
point : the u . s . be one of the only remain western liberal democracy to allow the u . s . of cluster bomb . the continued refusal of the u . s . to tow the same line a fellow liberal democracy make it look bad internationally ; especially consider that one of the main instigator behind the cluster bomb ban be the u . k . traditionally a great ally of the u . s . politically . 
counterpoint : the u . s . be currently develop cluster bomb technology that will prevent cluster bomb from remain arm over a long period of time . given that the u . s . be a pioneer in this area , it know more about the development of the technology than other country that might have sign up to the treaty . if the effort of the u . s . prove to be fruitful then their decision to avoid the ban will prove them a be the more politically shrewd of other liberal democracy .
