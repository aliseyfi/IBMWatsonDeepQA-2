point : certain factor may increase the chance of success : for example impose democracy on a nation with which there be once colonial relationship increase the expected lifespan of the democracy . democratic transition in general also tend to be more successful if economic condition be well . obviously we be not advocate impose democracy on every country which do not have it , but if there be strong enough institution and condition , imposition can work and there have be past success like germany and japan post wwii that show the worth of impose democracy1 2 . 
counterpoint : interventions be far more likely to fail than to succeed . as explain far in opposition argument 2 , empirically and logically impose democracy be likely to fail . governments can try and minimize the risk of failure , but it be inherent to the nature of imposition that a government be be instated against the country's will . it be consequently very unlikely to generate support and remain stable . 
point : if the people within a nation want democracy , it be not wrong indeed it may even be morally require for u to assist them by impose democracy against the will of the govern class . often internal movement lack resource , weapon , or organization , make the fight for democracy very difficult . when individual seek to defend their right against an oppressive regime , other nation do them a disservice by allow evil to win out . thus nato's intervention in libya be in support of rebel often see a part of the 'arab spring' wave of democratization but the internal movement even if it have large amount of support be be suppress and would have be destroy without outside intervention1 . 
counterpoint : first , it be not clear whether such a position be topical . second , it be well to support protester in this case , rather than take the lead . 
point : by most account , there have not be a war between two democracy in the past 200 year . immanuel kant argue in perpetual peace 1795 that a democratic government be more constrained by their people's opposition to war and b that a democratic culture of negotiation , as well a the check and balance inherent in such a system , make war less likely . thus by promote democracy through impose it , we increase the chance of a peaceful world . furthermore , terrorism may be less likely to arise in democratic country , where people be allow to air their view and human right norm prevent feeling of marginalization . this be good for human right worldwide , include the right and safety of individual in our own country . 1 
counterpoint : first , democracy be not necessarily more peaceful than other government . second , imposition of democracy be likely to fuel terrorism . first , it be not entirely clear that democracy have not go to war : for example the central powers in wwi , although not classify a democracy per se , do have elect parliament just like the allies . further , just because democracy have not go to war in the past do not mean they will not in the future : a culture of negotiation within the democracy do not necessarily translate into a lack of aggression externally . second , even if democracy be more peaceful , the imposition of democracy can threaten to world peace by fuel terrorist movement . invasions , particularly by western nation , increase east west tension , galvanize terrorist group by validate their claim that western nation pose a threat . indeed , in osama bin laden's public letter to the american people , he cite intervention in somalia , palestine , india , chechnya , lebanon and iraq a reason for the 9 11 attacks1 2 . 
point : democratic regime be the best form of government , and it be our obligation to try and provide that to others . democracy be the only form of government which uphold the value of political self determination : that each individual have a right to form his her government , and to vote out government s he do not like . to deny this right be to deny the inherent worth and freedom of the individual . political autonomy also have instrumental value insofar a it allow individual to check abusive government which may seek to violate other human right . thus it be certainly not wrong and may even be our humanitarian obligation to bring democracy to those who do not have it , just a we would intervene in other situation in which serious right be be abused1 . 
counterpoint : there be two problem : democracy be not necessarily the best form of government , and even if it be that do not mean it be our obligation to impose it .
