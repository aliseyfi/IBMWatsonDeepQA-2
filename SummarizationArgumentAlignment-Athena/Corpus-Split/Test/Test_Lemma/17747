point : nuclear weapon be , by their very nature , indiscriminate and disproportional ; any weapon which could not possibly be use in a responsible manner should not be permit . over the past fifty year , we have see a general tendency towards limit warfare and precision weapon , allow military objective to be achieve with minimal loss of civilian life . the entire point of nuclear weapon , however , be their massive , indiscriminate destructive power . their use could kill ten of thousand of civilian directly , and their catastrophic environmental after effect would harm many more all around the world . these effect could never be morally acceptable , particularly a the basis of one s national security strategy . they place humanity and most form of life in jeopardy of annihilation krieger , 2003 . no state or leader can be entrust , morally , with a power and responsibility that could come close to annihilate humanity . 
counterpoint : states have the right to possess any weapon that will materially support their ambition of survival , regardless of their destructive power . there be no great principle than that of self defence , and a state be entitle to develop any mean by which it improve it position vi Ã  vi an enemy and subsequently promote peace in the region and internationally . furthermore , the damage do by a nuclear weapon be no more indiscriminate or disproportional than the damage potentially cause by a prolonged aerial bombardment . in world war ii for instance , far more damage be work by fire bomb tokyo than either of the nuclear attack . the issue be therefore not whether nuclear weapon should be hold , but under which circumstance they be use , or threaten . either way , they should not be abolish . 
point : by claim the efficacy of nuclear weapon a a strategic deterrent , the current nuclear power encourage the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction krieger , 2003 . to be a part of the so called 'nuclear club' be see a a matter of great prestige ; when india and pakistan recently declare their nuclear capability and hold mutual test in the 1990s , it be see in both country a increase their international status . nevertheless , tension in the region have only increase since the mutual announcement , not least the kargil war of 1999 that almost precipitate a nuclear war . nations oppose to a nuclear power therefore feel that they need to develop their own capability in order to protect themselves . the declared nuclear power must therefore take the lead in disarmament , a an example for the rest of the world . 
counterpoint : states seek nuclear weapon not primarily in order to use them , but in order to take advantage of the security they offer . if state exist in a world post disarmament , the incentive to develop nuclear weapon for reason of security would not have disappear , in fact they would have increase a no other state would be able to use their more powerful conventional force against that state . as paul robinson note , conventional armament will remain the backbone of u . s . defence force , but the inherent threat to escalate to nuclear use can help to prevent conflict from start , prevent their escalation , as well a bring them to a swift and certain end robinson , 2001 . such potential advantage will not be lose on state in a nuclear free world . 
point : while nuclear weapon exist , they can fall into the wrong hand . this be particularly prevalent in an environment whereby there be extremist group actively seek to cause instant , egregious harm to their ideological and political enemy . such group do not lack for funding ; therefore the fear of weapon fall into the wrong hand have never be high . this be particularly true in russia , which now have control of all of the nuclear weapon which be distribute around the former soviet union . in particular during the 1990s the military be disastrously underfunded ; technician and officer who be use to a high standard of living find themselves without pay , sometimes for year . at the same time , other state and extremist group be willing to pay substantial sum for their service , and to gain access to nuclear weapon . this same danger be now as much , if not more , of a problem in pakistan ambinder , 2011 . the danger of a weapon be steal , or a nuclear base be take over by disgruntled member of the military or other extremist , can only be end by destroy the weapon allison , 1997 . 
counterpoint : the abolishment of nuclear weapon do not reduce the risk of them fall into the wrong hand . while nuclear weapon can be dismantle , the weapon grade plutonium which form their warhead cannot simply be destroy . instead , they must be store in special facility ; in russia , there be some three hundred site be military nuclear material be store national intelligence council , 2002 . it be produce this plutonium which be in fact the most difficult stage in build a weapon by dismantle missile , you be therefore not destroy their most dangerous part , and hence the risk of theft do not decrease . in fact , it may increase : missile silo in russia be still the most heavily funded part of the military , whereas in recent year it have become clear that security at storage facility be often inadequate . moreover , it be far easy to steal a relatively small quantity of plutonium than an entire intercontinental ballistic missile ; there be three such incident in russia in the 1990s of weapon grade uranium theft national intelligence council , 2002 . ironically , the safe place for plutonium in present day russia may be on top of such a missile . 
point : the disproportionate and indiscriminate nature of nuclear weapon use render their possession illegal under international humanitarian law . the international court of justice in 1996 , ask to provide an advisory opinion , declare unanimously that any use or threat of nuclear weapon have to be compatible with exist international law relate to arm conflict international court of justice , 1996 . the principle of discrimination and proportionality inherent in the law of war be codify in the geneva conventions of 1949 , and be quite clearly violate by nuclear weapon . as such , a majority of the judge present felt that any such use or threat would generally be contrary to those rule of international law and therefore , unanimously , there exist an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiation lead to nuclear disarmament in all it aspect under strict and effective international control international court of justice , 1996 . 
counterpoint : the count be only ask to provide an advisory opinion ; their adjudication have no subsequent basis in law . anyhow , the very same jury vote unanimously that there be in neither customary nor conventional international law any comprehensive and universal prohibition of the threat or use of nuclear weapon a such international court of justice , 1996 . unlike biological and chemical weapon , for which specific treaty have be develop to regulate and prevent their use , the absence of regulation for nuclear weapon implicitly recognize wide hold appreciation for their deterrent effect 
point : the co operation of the united states and russia , demonstrate in their regularly renew start treaty , confer the ability of nuclear power to work towards a reduction in nuclear stockpile . a new campaigning body , global zero , have lay out the path to nuclear abolishment , concern first bilateral accord to reduce stockpile in the manner already occur . from there , they advocate the universal acceptance of a comprehensive verification and enforcement system accompany by tight control on fissile material produce by civil nuclear program the economist , 2011 . the process will not be swift , but it be plausible and not a stretch consider the success of previous start treaty and the example of the international atomic energy agency a an independent body charge with verify nuclear installation . 
counterpoint : the process be implausible , primarily because whilst the actual weapon can be dismantle , the technology remain and the only effective mean to deter the development of a nuclear weapon be a nuclear weapon . even if this be not the case , such a gradual and incremental process of disarmament do not account for the weapon hold by state who have not officially declare their presence , like israel . furthermore , though a verification agency may have universal access to nuclear stockpile , it have little power to enforce state to adhere to treaty , precipitate the scenario whereby one state refuse to give up it final weapon and stall the process indefinitely . finally , this process assume that state wish to see nuclear weapon abolish , rather than the more common assumption that state view nuclear weapon a necessary , not merely to deter other nuclear power but for traditional deterrence and nuclear blackmail . would all state willingly give that up ?
