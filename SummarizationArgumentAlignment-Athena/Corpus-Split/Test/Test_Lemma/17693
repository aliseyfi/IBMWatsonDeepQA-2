point : obviously , renewable energy source must be develop and the way americans consume energy must be address , but that be no reason to ignore an effective part of the solution . considering the amount of oil that the us currently consume , 19 million barrel a day , it be both unreasonable and na√Øve to believe that the us will quit use oil overnight . oil will need to be phase out slowly , but until then , the us will continue to consume and demand oil . the cost of oil be place a serious strain on the us economy and on individual household budget , and every available strategy should be use to combat the problem . 
counterpoint : offshore drilling be a band aid solution to a more fundamental problem . oil be a finite resource . the reality be that the united states consume energy at rate far great than the growth in supply . such consumption be not sustainable and must be address . offshore drill only make a tiny contribution to the problem of supply , while ignore the more fundamental problem of us demand . opening america's coastal water to offshore drill only reinforce this misconception and will continue to kick the can down the road instead of gather support for the long term solution of renewable energy . 
point : offshore drilling will lower gas petroleum price . the energy information administration eia estimate that offshore drilling could generate 18 billion barrel of crude oil1 . while it consume 18 , 771 , 400 barrel of oil every day2 . the us consumes huge amount of oil , and therefore need to produce more . greater availability of domestic oil will result in low gas price for american consumer . the ban have prevent the us from take advantage of this know resource . considering how oil be use in various aspect of american life and industry , high gas price contribute to economic health . in 2011 , gas price be 4 a gallon and it be think that these high gas price jeopardize the economic recovery . lowering gas price be therefore essential to improve economic outlook , and therefore offshore drilling should be consider a a viable option . 
counterpoint : the impact of drilling on oil price will be minimal and will take year to be felt by us consumer . oil price be largely set by worldwide supply and demand , with recent rise reflect increase energy use in rapidly grow economy such a china . the amount of oil generate from offshore drill in the us will not impact world oil market in any significant way1 . additionally , scientist do not know with any certainty how much oil can actually be extract . furthermore , oil exploration and rig construction take many year to complete . according to the eia , offshore drilling would not produce any measurable change in oil price until 2030 . 
point : even in prosperous economic time , provide job and stable growth should be at the forefront of policy maker's mind . having more money in the government's coffer also never hurt consider that keep a balanced budget be extremely difficult . turning down an industry that could promote job and tax revenue be therefore unwise , particularly when there be way to make it safe . 2011 have prove to be one of the harsh american job market since the 1970s . for that reason , cut job and turn away tax revenue needlessly cannot be justify . it be estimate that the slow permit process for offshore drilling have cost the gulf area 230 , 000 job and 44 billion include tax revenue1 . since the offshore drilling industry create job and tax revenue and can be execute without jeopardize the environment then it be a viable option for investment and should be pursue . 
counterpoint : obama promise 150 billion to create 5 million job in the green industry over the next 10 year . the green and renewable energy industry be just develop and therefore promise employment for year to come , whereas the job offer from the offshore drilling industry be finite , like the resource itself1 . 
point : drilling will decrease us dependency on foreign oil and will make america safer . currently the united states must buy most of it oil from authoritarian and often hostile state such a saudi arabia , venezuela and iran , or from unstable place like nigeria . 22 of us oil come from the middle east , 22 from africa , and 19 from latin america1 . it be estimate that the oil in offshore reserve could supply us energy need for two year . when problem occur in these unstable energy produce country , it often cause oil price to rise , and the us have no way of avoid these consequence . oil price increase when the crisis in libya ensued2 . additionally , the us lose leverage over many international actor a it hand be tie due to dependence on oil , this be the case with nuclear proliferation in iran for example . offshore drilling and increase energy independence could help distance america from anti democratic regime and the impact of unrest in these unstable nation . 
counterpoint : offshore drilling will not make the us safer or more energy independent . while america only have 3 of the world's oil reserve , it consume 19 of the global oil supply . the us doesn't have enough oil to meet it demand . even if the eia estimate be correct , offshore reserve will have little impact and the us will have to continue buy oil from potentially unfriendly nation for year to come . the only path to true energy independence and great national security be to decrease american energy consumption and to invest in homegrown renewable energy .
