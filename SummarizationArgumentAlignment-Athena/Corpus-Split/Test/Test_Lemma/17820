point : it be important for the eu to have a defence policy independent of nato . with it origin in the cold war , and it preponderance of american influence , nato carry a great deal of historical and geopolitical baggage . this mean that nato cannot easily intervene in eastern europe without incur the displeasure of russia . this be best proven during the 2008 conflict between russia and georgia , when georgia s impend accession to nato be see a part of the incentive for russian support to the break away region in georgia 1 . the european defence force will allow the eu to deal with crisis in eastern and central europe more effectively , a they will not have to tiptoe around russia a much . 
counterpoint : nato have successfully defend the interest of western europe for several decade now why rock the boat ? it be hard to see a problem which nato cannot solve , which the european defence force could instead . in any case , we will always have to consider russia s sensibility when engage in peacekeeping operation in eastern europe , and it be far good to have america s bargain power and geopolitical clout back u when we negotiate with russia . if we create a european defence force , we will marginalise nato and the united states . this will lead to a reduce us engagement in europe , which may in turn diminish our influence when have discussion with russia over security issue in europe and beyond . 
point : the european union have significant integration and convergence of the political and economic sphere . integration of defence policy and the establishment of a european defence force should be the logical next step . the african union take this step and have achieve success in combat mission defend the union 1 . 
counterpoint : we have see variation in opinion regard political and economic issue e . g . monetary union in the eu . in the far more thorny area of defence policy , the eu member nation interest be even more divergent . for example , the french position on algeria may be different from the united kingdom s . this difference in priority will ultimately lead to deadlock , a no country wish to see it soldier die on a battlefield that provide no direct strategic interest to itself . 
point : nato have be crucial to maintain the balance of power during the cold war . although there have be some argument amongst it member state , nato have show u that a stand multinational defence force be possible and more importantly work well overall . the recent nato deployment in libya be an example of it regional influence and military flexibility 1 . considering many member of nato be also member of the eu , the propose european defence force could follow it example and complement it . 
counterpoint : nato and the propose european defence force be design to address very different concern . nato exist to deal with situation of such magnitude that the nation of western europe be likely to adopt a common defence policy . in contrast , the edf be target at small geopolitical incident which would otherwise be beneath the notice of nato . unfortunately small incident by their nature do not have uniform effect on all eu member nation , and be therefore unlikely to generate a consensus of policy among eu nation . 
point : with the grow industrial and economic maturity of the european union and it member , it be now financially feasible for the eu to have it own standing defence force 1 . the propose edf would also create a great many job a european defence contractor could be recruit into supply equipment and weaponry . 
counterpoint : even if we assume that the massive cost of a stand military force can be bear by the eu and it member , the key barrier to establish a stand defence force be often political . creating a european defence force de novo would require u to decide on several thorny question , namely the command structure , whether the role should be merely defensive or include peacekeeping , the choice of equipment and supplier , create a common defence policy , and choose a language of communication . all of these question involve political consideration or economic vested interest , all of which be likely to result in on go wrangle that will yield a stillborn edf . 
point : constant political instability and war in and near the middle east call for a united single force charge with the defence of eu country lie close to the volatile area . . turkey be a prime candidate for eu membership , and with it location on the border of both syria and iraq , will require support if it refugee problem be to remain manageable . the revolution in northern africa also call for a stabilise force in the region , particularly in italy where a refugee crisis have coincide with the attempt of anti gaddafi libyans to flee the country 1 . if the eu be to take it grow role upon the world stage seriously , it need a dedicated defence force to make an impact in the region . 
counterpoint : although there be instability in neighbour region , most of europe be in complete and utter peace . the new force would simply be another layer of defence in a stable continent that simply doesn t need it . war in europe be completely inconceivable in the 21st century , and consider the threat of war should be the primary reason for hold a stand army , it seem that an eu army have no reasonable case for existence .
