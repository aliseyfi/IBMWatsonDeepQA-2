point : holocaust denial be extremely offensive to holocaust victim and member of the persecuted group . it be highly distress for these people and remove a feeling of safety that everybody deserve . due to the severity of the holocaust , the proposition that it do not occur be an assault on a very fundamental part of one s identity . 
counterpoint : nobody hold the right to not be offend . everyone have the right to complete free speech unless it directly harm another person . making someone uncomfortable in no way justify remove someone s ability to exercise their free speech . 
point : holocaust denial encourage further anti semitism . those who deny the holocaust be anti semitic , usually regard it a a myth spread by jews to justify the creation of israel . this create the idea of a jewish conspiracy which entrench suspicion , hatred and discrimination towards jews . the more available such opinion be in public , the more people will engage with them and those who would otherwise keep quiet about their fermenting prejudice feel they be part of a large group which give them confidence to air their racist opinion . so , holocaust denial can be see a a hate crime , since it aim be to perpetuate racial myth . 
counterpoint : the overwhelming public consensus be that the holocaust do indeed occur . it seem very unlikely that most individual be go to be persuade by poor or fabricate evidence that this be not the case . indeed , by bring holocaust denial into the open and be able to directly challenge it belief we be able to dissuade people from be convince by it falsity by be able to actively engage with the denial community . communities which be underground be much hard to directly engage with , and find it easy to foster a sense of conspiracy that make their view more plausible to potential recruit . finally , openness make it easy to monitor such group and punish them if they do indeed begin to engage in directly illegal and harmful activity , such a political subversion or racial motivate assault . 
point : holocaust denial be debate in the public sphere imply that it be a legitimate point of view to hold . 
counterpoint : debating the matter do not mean that holocaust denial will appear a legitimate intellectual position . in fact , it will be show to be wholly without merit and holocaust denier will be expose a anti semitic liar . it be dangerous to argue that the matter should not be debate : holocaust denier will say that this be an admission that academic argument be not strong enough to defeat their belief . 
point : impressionable member of the public , particularly child , must be protect from the view of holocaust denier . 
counterpoint : it be true that it would be highly dangerous if holocaust denier gain public support . this do not mean it should be ban . rather , it mean that the state have a responsibility to ensure that the public be expose to the argument that show that holocaust denier be wrong . this be best do through compulsory history teach about the holocaust in school .
