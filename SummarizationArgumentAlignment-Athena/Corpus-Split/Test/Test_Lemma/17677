point : abstinence program teach teenager how to have meaningful , age appropriate relationship , and help young people fight the pressure of have sex before they be ready . 
counterpoint : there be little evidence that abstention only program delay the initiation of sex . a range of study have demonstrate that they do not delay the onset of sexual activity or reduce the frequency with which sex occur once a teenager have become sexually active . 
point : sex carry with it a multitude of risk and responsibility . all sex even protect have the possibility of lead to stis or pregnancy , both of which have huge psychological , emotional , and physical impact . furthermore , sex can create emotional bond between individual which be overwhelm and intense . young people be simply not emotionally or physically mature enough to take such risk , or accept such responsibility , and so it be irresponsible to teach anything but abstinence . 
counterpoint : abstinence be obviously the most effective form of birth control and protection from stis , but tell student to practice abstinence do not mean that they will . abstinence should absolutely be emphasize a an important method of stay safe , but teach it alongside other information about sex and protection be far more responsible than pretend that these thing do not exist . even if young people shouldn t be have sex which be not necessarily true , many clearly be slightly under half of high school student have have sex accord to the kaiser family foundation . 1 consequently , it be well to a ensure that they have adequate knowledge to stay safe and b view their teacher a honest and informative , so that they trust their advice and do not simply reject the class a moralizing or irrelevant . 
point : although most previous evidence support abstinence only education fail to meet high scientific standard , a recent study have present what the washington post call the first clear evidence that abstinence only education really can work . the federally fund study find that only about a third of 6th and 7th grader receive abstinence only education have sex over the following two year , whereas nearly half of 6th and 7th grader attend other class become sexually active . 1 and , abstinence only education do not affect condom usage 2 confirm what the mathematica policy research study cite by the opposition also find ! 3 . this suggest that good abstinence only program this one , for example , do not condemn condom implement at a young age , do have real effect on young people s sexual activity . 
counterpoint : first , the program in this study be not a typical abstinence only program ; for example it do not encourage delay sex until marriage . 1 second , the vast majority of evidence still suggest that these program do not work , a the washington post concedes when they call this study the first clear evidence . for example , an eight year study by the mathematica policy research inc . find that there be no evidence that abstinence only program reduce the rate of sexual activity among young people . 2 furthermore , it be not clear that these program have any significant impact on pregnancy or sti rate . for example , a 2007 study find that abstinence only program do not affect the risk of hiv infection in high income country . 3 see opp argument 2 for more detail on how sex ed do a good job at reduce pregnancy rate , particularly because it teach student how to properly use condom . 
point : given that cultural and social attitude towards sex be so variable , it should be up to the family to decide how to broach this sensitive topic . schools be suppose to give student the skill and knowledge they need for employment and or high education : sex education be a separate , much more personal , issue . telling student to abstain ensures that no one be taught anything more than their parent want , and leave room for parent to give a more extensive education if they so desire . this be especially true since most parent support abstinence education anyway : a zogby international poll of u . s . parent find that 78 of parent think sex education class in public school should place more emphasis on promote abstinence than on condom and other contraceptive use . 1 
counterpoint : first , to clarify , while the poll find that 78 of parent think sex education class should place more emphasis on abstinence , it also find that more parent would rather their child be enrol in comprehensive sex education course than in abstinence education course . 1 but more importantly , the problem with rely on parent to teach their child essential sexual information be that many child do not have parent , or responsible one . these child need a holistic education more than anyone , and it be unfair to prevent them from learn about sex just because they have no one willing to talk to them about it . furthermore , school be mean to prepare student not only academically , but also socially : sending student into the world with no knowledge about sex be irresponsible both to the student , who be may be unprepared for a very large part of their life , and to society , which must deal with an uneducated and consequently at risk population . cultural attitude aside , there be some medical fact student need to know . see opp argument 3 for more detail . 
point : monogamous sex be much safe than polygamous sex , a it reduce the chance of obtain and spread stis . furthermore , sex outside of marriage make it more difficult to develop intimate and trust relationship . random sexual partner who be unsure of each other s fidelity cannot develop the same type of unique and personal relationship that a committed couple can . numerous study have show that this be the case ; have more partner increase the std risk . 1 and , sex before marriage go against cultural and religious principle . abstinence education rightly teach teenager that save sex for marriage be the best way to be healthful and happy . 
counterpoint : non marital sex be not wrong . if two consent individual wish to have sex , and feel that they would be make happy by the experience , there be no reason to deny them that right . furthermore , so long a individual use protection and get test for stis both measure that sex ed encourages they should not be significantly more at risk than committed couple .
