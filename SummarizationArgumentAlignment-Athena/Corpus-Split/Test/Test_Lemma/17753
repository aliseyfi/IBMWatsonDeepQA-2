point : as robert cox argue , american hegemony have be successful because the us have be able to maintain it dominance through a high level of global consensus by establish a broadly accept rule base liberal international economic order , and have be able to shape other state preference in a manner that have award sufficient benefit to these state while ensure the dominance of the us . 1 this have be what john ikenberry term america s liberal grand strategy , which have enable the us to construct a relatively benign and highly institutionalized multilateral system base on open market , free trade , and the provision of public good , such a collective security and an open international trading regime . 2 this have allow other country to prosper economically and also in term of their security ; the rebuilding and success of japan and germany provide important example of this . 
counterpoint : while the liberal order the us have construct have benefit it allied economy in western europe and japan , for much of the developing world the benefit have be few and far between . for example , many african and asian nation have suffer tremendously from the spread of free market capitalism and the structural adjustment programme impose on them by the american dominate international monetary fund imf . rather than help poor nation , the west lead by america have often practice selective freed trade , whereby the market of the developing world be open up to foreign company a the united states and it western ally subsidize and provide unfair advantage to sector of their own economy that be not a globally competitive , such a farming . this cripple the agricultural industry of many develop country and make them dependent on import food , directly contribute to many recent food crisis . what be more , the us and it ally have manipulatively achieve this through nominally multilateral and fair institution such a the imf , the world bank and the world trade organization wto . 3 many country have not receive the benefit of this so called benign open , liberal order . 
point : an important part of the liberal international order the us maintains be that power be diffuse and be base on negotiation , strategic bargaining and the exercise of power through mutually agree rule and institution . globalization and the liberalization of the global economy have be actively support by many nation in the world , some of whom such a china , japan , and germany have even use it to compete economically with the united states . other state have also enjoy significant decision make power in international institution . for example , the world trade organization wto decision be make on the basis of a one country , one vote system . 4 this consensus base exercise of power have provide the us with a relatively large degree of legitimacy in world opinion , often outstrip the global approval rating of other major power . 5 
counterpoint : the united states have far too often rely on the use of force and coercion . for much of the cold war and thereafter , america covertly and openly help overthrow and wage war on government that it perceive to be hostile to it national interest . from latin america to southeast asia and the middle east , coercion and war have often be america s primary foreign policy tool . moreover , this continue to the present time . not only have iraq highlight america s propensity to use force , but even the more internationally backed war on terror have feature unilateralism and controversial military practice such a drone attack , which many say be counterproductive and undermine the importance of a law base rather than militaristic approach to tackle terrorism . 6 even in nominally multilateral body such a the wto and the un , the us have often get it way through bribe , backdoor deal and coercive measure . 7 
point : america s hegemonic power have enable it to provide global leadership on important international concern . because the us be affect by the same problem a many other country in an increasingly inter connect world for example climate change , terrorism , epidemic , oil crisis , economic recession , the illegal drug trade , and nuclear proliferation it be in it interest to promote policy that be broadly globally beneficial . the us be able to utilize it considerable economic and diplomatic clout to convince it ally to back important multilateral international initiative . one example of this be george w . bush s initiative on hiv aids in the developing world . the united states have also use it power to unify the global effort against terrorism and provide collective security and considerable aid to various nation , as well a lead the international effort to prevent failed or weak state such a somalia and yemen fall into the hand of terrorist . 
counterpoint : rather than promote a progressive global agenda , the united states have often undermine effective cooperation and coordination between country a a result of unilateralist and self interested policy . thus , it have often regard the united nations a an ineffectual rival to it national interest lead the country to disaster such a the iraq war and undemocratically veto internationally back initiative in the un security council , such a those critical of israel s occupation of the west bank . rather than show leadership , the us have also obstruct international effort to tackle climate change , a see by george w . bush s refusal to sign the kyoto protocol and president obama s signing of the deeply flaw copenhagen accord . 8 . many instance have also show america s willingness to pursue it own commercial interest at the expense of vital international issue . one example of this be george w . bush s protectionism in protect the intellectual property right and the high price of drug include anti aids drug of us pharmaceutical , which damage the international fight against aids . 
point : examining the use of american military power follow the end of the cold war show u that the united states have pursue an agenda of tackle serious threat to international peace , security and prosperity whether they emanate from rogue state and sponsor of terrorism , oppressive dictator , or war criminal . humanitarian intervention in yugoslavia , iraq , afghanistan and most recently libya highlight the importance of these consideration to america s military strategy , and the willingness of the us to put aside narrow geopolitical interest in order to pursue humanitarian goal , to the benefit of much of the world . 10 america s military dominance and command of the common sea , space and air have also allow it to provide global collective good and to maintain an open international order , which be vital to international prosperity . 11 
counterpoint : on close inspection , it be evident that while many of these intervention espouse humanitarian principle , they be primarily design to advance us strategic and geopolitical interest . critics have be right to argue that the iraq war be fight to gain strategic control of middle eastern oil and to dismantle the state dominate economic structure of the region . no weapons of mass destruction wmd be find in iraq , and overthrow a dictatorship could not have be a primary consideration , give america s support for authoritarian regime and dictatorship across the world such a uzbekistan and saudi arabia . these contradiction can be see in the recent libya conflict , where the us suddenly endorse regime change despite year of support colonel gaddafi . other humanitarian intervention have similarly be motivate in large part by self interested strategic and geopolitical consideration . 
point : the collapse of the soviet union and the victory of liberal democracy over communism have provide the us with more impetus to actively promote democracy , human right and international norm and law . under president clinton , the leahy amendment to the defense appropriations act of 1998 and the religious persecution act of the same year demonstrate this change in priority . democracy promotion also become a core element of george w . bush s national security strategy of 2002 , and have be a key motivating factor in president obama s response to the arab spring , where the us have support democratic force against dictator such a hosni mubarak of egypt and colonel gaddafi of libya . the us under obama have also provide leadership in the un human rights council 12 , and hold government to account through the bureau of democracy , human rights and labour drl , which also forge and maintain global partnership to promote human right and democracy . 13 
counterpoint : us support for democracy have be at best hugely inconsistent , and at bad criminally apathetic . during the cold war , the us overthrew various democratic government for example iran and guatemala in the 1950s and support dictatorial regime . this have continue into the post cold war era , a the us support for the coup attempt against president hugo chavez of venezuela in 2002 demonstrate . while the us profess support for democratic force in the arab world , it have also continue to give vital assistance to the strategically important dictatorship of the gulf , primarily saudi arabia and bahrain , which have be responsible for grave human right abuse in response to recent peaceful protest 14 . the us also continue to support state such a israel which violate international law , and also routinely flout international law itself a see by war such a iraq , the treatment of terrorist suspect and breach of the geneva convention 15 , the undermining of the international criminal court icc , and the violation of country sovereignty with drone attack . clinical realpolitik , and not the pursuit of democracy and human right , determine the use of us power .
