point : the concept of monarchy be undemocratic . if the monarch retain any significant political power , a they do in belgium and the u . k . for example , these be unjustifiable . why should the opinion of just one person , in office purely by accident of birth , be able to influence the outcome of election or call a government . legally , in the uk the monarch have the power to ; choose the prime minister , dismiss minister and government , dissolve parliament , refuse to agree to legislation pass by parliament , pardon convict criminal , declare a state of emergency and raise a personal militia . 1 and in some country like saudi arabia they have much more absolute power . a recent example where the monarch have a role in the united kingdom be within the 2010 election where no party achieve an overall majority , the queen therefore have to sign her approval for the conservative and liberal democrat coalition . 
counterpoint : while the monarchy have legal right , the real power of european monarchs be negligible . for example , while the monarch legally have the power to dissolve parliament , no monarch have do this since william iv in 1834 . technically the monarchy also have the power to veto any legislation that come through parliament , however , this power have not be exercise since queen anne in 1708 1 . to the point of the concept of the monarchy , canadian historian jacques monet have suggest that ''in choose to leave the selection of their head of state to this most common denominator in the world the accident of birth canadians implicitly proclaim their faith in human equality ; their hope for the triumph of nature over political manoeuvre , over social and financial interest ; for the victory of the human person . 2 
point : the cost of monarchy be unjustifiable . typically monarch and their immediate family receive substantial amount of money from the state to maintain luxurious lifestyle , complete with servant , expensive holiday and hobby . the state also spend a great deal to maintain and run palace and other royal residence , which be seldom accessible to the general public who support them through their tax . in the uk what be officially term a 'head of state expenditure' amount to 40 million in the 2007 8 financial year . however , this exclude the cost of security for the numerous family member and residence . although the security cost have not be confirm , it be estimate that it exceed 50 million a year 1 . 
counterpoint : there be three counter point that can be use to challenge the proposition . firstly , the opposition maintain that the monarchy be highly cost effective when compare to the expense of maintain a presidency with a large staff and equally stringent security requirement . secondly , royal residence be hold in trust for the nation , and would require the same upkeep cost whether they be inhabit by a monarch or not . thirdly , and possibly most importantly , the monarchy more than pay it way through it generation of tourist revenue a million visit site associate with royalty , and through it role in promote trade and industry abroad on royal visit . there be also evidence to suggest that the nation actually benefit financially from the crown estate . figures suggest by professor david flint 1 be that in 2009 10 all payment to the crown come to about 30 million . but the british government receive 211 million from the crown estate . so the government make a very substantial profit from the queen about 181 million . 
point : monarchs no longer have divine right to rule . for century the main justification of royal authority be a religious one . catholic ruler have their legitimacy support by the papacy , protestants ruler often head their own state church ; in both the monarch s rightful authority be preach in church every sunday , while the ruler in turn protect a single national church . currently , the monarch be term 'the defender of the protestant faith' . she or he be require to be a member of the church of england and be not allow to marry a catholic . today society be increasingly multi faith , indeed , few than 5 of adult in the united kingdom be practise anglicans , and many people have no religion at all ; hardly anyone believe the monarch have a spiritual right to exercise authority . indeed , those whose religion differs from that of the monarch often ethnic minority may be actively alienate by the way in which a particular faith seem to be privilege . 1 
counterpoint : on the other hand , the monarchy could instead be see a an institution that retain an important symbolic role a a focus for national unity . the monarch have a less formal role a 'head of nation' . the sovereign act a a focus for national identity , unity and pride ; give a sense of stability and continuity ; officially recognise success and excellence ; and support the ideal of voluntary service . 1 since they be unelected figure which be above political conflict and can therefore help country to avoid the political gridlock that can result from conflict between two differently elect body , for example within the u . s . a . between the republicans and the democrats . not only do the monarch provide a symbol of national unity but also a symbol of world wide unity . queen elizabeth ii be the monarch of 16 independent country and the head of the commonwealth of 54 nation across the globe . 
point : the alternative to the monarch be obvious . many state around the world have presidential system , either like the united states where the president fulfil both the role of the head of state and the head of government combine the two role . or a in italy or germany where there be both a head of state usually president and a head of government usually prime minister , although germany s be chancellor where the head of state be respect but be mostly a ceremonial role . finally there may be both a head of state and head of government where both be powerful a in france . therefore the head of state can still be in whatever role the state require . most importantly in all these case the head of state be elect rather than simply gain the position on account of birth . 
counterpoint : the head of government will already be elect . there be no need to create a compete centre of power that have the same popular legitimacy . just a there be worry that an elected house of lord would want more power due to it new find legitimacy an elect head of state could demand the same . such a change would be disruptive and be not necessary .
