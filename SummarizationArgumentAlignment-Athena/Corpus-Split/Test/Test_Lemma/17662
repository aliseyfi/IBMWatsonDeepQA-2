point : it be important that we have the liberty to do what we want to our own body . people be allow to eat or drink to their detriment . in many country it be legal to take one's life . why then , should people not be allow to harm themselves through cannabis use ? assuming that cannabis use be harmful . in most case , this be highly debatable . 
counterpoint : while individual liberty be an important good , there be case in which a government can be justify in behave in a paternalistic manner , even to prevent individual harm themselves . few people debate the law that you must wear a seatbelt in car , for example . 
point : although cannabis can have some harmful effect , it be not nearly as harmful a tobacco or alcohol . research by the british medical association show that nicotine be more addictive . in england and wales , cannabis be say to have help cause 17 death , compare to 6627 for alcohol and 86 , 500 for tobacco1 . a study , publish by the lancet , that score drug out of 100 for the harm they cause the user and others , give alcohol 72 , tobacco 27 and cannabis 202 . 
counterpoint : it be difficult to assess the true harm cause by cannabis . there be limit to the scope for information on it effect because of it illegal nature1 . however , it be widely acknowledge that there be link between cannabis use and mental and physical health problems2 . it be also widely acknowledge that excessive cannabis use can harm relationship and prevent people from act a functional member of society . cannabis be generally smoke with tobacco and cannabis user be more likely to drink alcohol . regardless of whether cannabis itself be bad for you than tobacco or alcohol , it be still bad for you and therefore it should remain illegal . 
point : many of the problem associate with cannabis use arise from the fact that it be illegal . cannabis be the world s most widely used illegal drug 23 of canadians admit to have smoke it and up to 7 million people in the uk be estimate to do so . 
counterpoint : legalizing cannabis would not stop the criminal who currently sell it from continue to commit crime . they could simply diversify their activity . many of them would already be deal other drug or involve in other criminal activity . the legalization of cannabis could simply give them a legitimate base from which they may operate . 
point : cannabis use can alter one's perception of reality or consciousness . the alteration need not be think of a spiritual or religious to be respect for what it be ; a fresh look on a reality that we be program a human to perceive only in a particular manner . cannabis can help human perceive that complex reality from simply a different perspective , which can benefit our appreciation for that reality and our unique and limited perception of it . with this more intelligent approach to cannabis consumption , it be easy to argue that mental , perceptual , and societal benefit exist1 . 1 harris , s . 2011 , july 6 . drugs and the meaning of life . retrieved july 20 , 2011 , from huffington post : 11 
counterpoint : cannabis do not open the mind . rather , it harm it . many researcher have conclude that cannabis impairs short term memory , cognition and motivation . it have also prove to be highly addictive for some user and have damage people's mental capability and ability to function in society1 . 2 mabry , c . d . 2001 , october . physicians and the war on drug : the case against legalization . retrieved july 20 , 2011 , from qualified surgeons : 12
