point : the only function of a gun be to kill . the more instrument of death and injury can be remove from our society , the safer it will be . in the u . s . a . death by gunshot have become the lead cause of death among some social group ; in particular for african american male age from 12 to 19 year old . 1 quite simply , gun be lethal and the few people have them the good . 
counterpoint : prohibition be not the answer , especially not in country such a the usa where gun ownership be such an entrenched aspect of society . banning gun would not make them disappear or make them any less dangerous . it be a legitimate right of citizen to own weapon with which they can protect themselves , their family , and their property see point 4 . many people also need gun for other reason . for example , farmer need gun in order to protect their stock and crop from pest , e . g . rabbit , bird , deer , fox , stray dog attack sheep , etc . 
point : the legal ownership of gun by law abide citizen inevitably lead to many unnecessary and tragic death . legally hold gun be steal and end up in the hand of criminal , who would have great difficulty in obtain such weapon if firearm be less prevalent in society . guns also end up in the hand of child , lead to tragic accident and terrible disaster such a the columbine high school massacre in the u . s . a . sometimes even normal seem registered gun owner appear to go mad and kill , a tragically happen at hungerford and dunblaine in the u . k . 
counterpoint : guns don t kill people people kill people . restricting gun ownership will do nothing to make society safer a it be the intent of the criminal we should fear , and that will remain the same whatever the gun law . in the vast majority of crime involve firearm , the gun use be not legally hold or register . many of illegal weapon be import secretly from abroad , or convert from replica firearm rather than be steal from register owner . 
point : shooting a a sport desensitise people to the lethal nature of all firearm , create a gun culture that glamorise and legitimise unnecessary gun ownership . it remain the interest of a minority , who should not be allow to block the interest of society a a whole in gun control . compensation can be give to individual gun owner , gun club and the retail firearm trade , in recognition of their economic loss if a ban be implement . 
counterpoint : shooting be a major sport enjoy by many law abide people , both in gun club with purpose build range and a a field sport . these people have the right to continue with their chosen leisure pursuit , on which they have spend large amount of money an investment the government would effectively be confiscate if their gun be confiscate . in addition , field sport bring money into poor rural economy and provide a motivation for landowner to value environmental protection . while compensation could be give the cost would be huge ; in the uk shooting value to the economy be 1 . 6billion in 2004 . 1 
point : there be a correlation between the laxity of a country s gun law and it suicide rate not because gun owner be more depressive , but because the mean of quick and effective suicide be easily to hand . as many unsuccessful suicide be later glad that they fail in their attempt , the state should discourage and restrict the ownership of something that waste so many human life . 
counterpoint : there be substantial exception to that correlation , for example japan have the world s 5th high suicide rate but very low gun ownership . 1
