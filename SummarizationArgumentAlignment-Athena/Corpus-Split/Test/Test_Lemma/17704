point : whenever a church make a radical change to it doctrine and teaching it cause a huge amount of tension within the church . an excellent example of this be the church of england allow woman to become bishop ; a huge number of people leave the church over the controversy . since the catholic church's ban over contraception of all kind be something that it have stand fast over for a great number of year , as well a something that set it apart from most other denomination and faith , the proposition believe that a change in this would result in a huge amount of tension within the church . this tension would inevitably bring about a considerable risk of large part of the church collapse altogether . this would be much the same a the tension over gay priest in the anglican church that have lead to fear of a schism1 . therefore , in the interest of it own stability , the sensible course of action for the catholic church to take be to maintain it ban on contraception . 1 brown , andrew . jeffrey john and the global anglican schism : a potted history . guardian . co . uk , 8 july 2010 3 
counterpoint : the catholic church already have huge number of people leave , this could help stop that . the catholic church be already become increasingly unpopular because of it refusal to compromise on any issue and it inability to adapt and change to keep up with an ever changing world . rather than damage the stability of the church , allow barrier contraception would show that the church be capable of change when change be necessary . importantly , when the church of england allow woman to become bishop , it cause some tension at the time but have no long term negative impact on the stability of the church . 
point : condoning the use of barrier method of contraception would be implicitly condone casual sex since their primary function be within that context . this be particularly important since the catholic church's teaching on casual sex be not take particularly seriously already . any action , such a the catholic church allow the use of barrier contraception , that would promote casual sex in country with severe aids hiv problem , would be an incredibly irresponsible one . pope paul vi argue that when consider the consequence of method and plan for artificial birth control . let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standard . the church's current stance on barrier contraception , therefore , be the most responsible one1 . 1 pope paul vi . humanae vitae . 1968 . 4 
counterpoint : more casual sex with barrier contraception be preferable to the current amount without contraception . the amount of consensual sex be not go to change no matter what the church teach . as long a the use of barrier contraception be promote along with this promotion of casual sex , it would be a huge net reduction in the case of contraction of hiv . therefore , condone the use of barrier contraception would be the more responsible stand to take on the part of the catholic church . 
point : the catholic church do not only forbid the use of barrier contraception but also of casual sex . the issue be not that the church be be irresponsible by ban the use of barrier contraception but that people be choose to follow some of the church's teaching but not others . pope benedict xvi argue aids be a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone , that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condom , which even aggravate the problem 1 . if people follow the church's teaching on casual sex as well a their teaching on barrier contraception , the aids epidemic would be dramatically decrease . given , therefore , that it also forbid any sex outside of marriage , the catholic church be totally justified in forbid barrier method of contraception2 . 1 wynne jones , jonathan . the pope drop catholic ban on condom in historic shift . the telegraph , 20 november 2010 , 5 2 pope john paul ii . evangelium vitae . 1995 . 6 
counterpoint : aids hiv can be spread outside of have casual sex . the hiv epidemic be spread not just through people have casual sex . in many case , wife contract hiv after their husband be unfaithful or have have premarital sex . there be also many case where a woman have little choice in be sell off to a man and be force to have sex with him . there be also a huge number of case of rape where hiv be contract . in all of these case , if the catholic church have condone barrier contraception , the likelihood of hiv be contract a a result would have be dramatically reduce ; whether that be through contraception be use in that particular instance of intercourse or through the man not contract hiv in the first place . 
point : catholics consider the first commandment give to them by god to be to 'multiply'1 . in light of this , anything that limit procreation , be it the use of contraception or even condone the use of contraception , be against god . it be important to remember that the catholic church's primary obligation be not to it people but to god . the church be , therefore , justify in any action where the alternative be go against what they believe to be the wish of god , even if it be harmful to the people of the church . 11 : 28 , the book of genesis , the bible . 
counterpoint : the commandment give be to 'go forth and multiply' , not to multiply as much a possible with no thought for sustainability . contraception can help monogamous couple control the amount of child they have and when so that they can ensure they don't have more child than they can sustainably provide for . the idea that any limitation of procreation be against god be a single interpretation of a very ambiguous passage . the catholic church have the freedom to choose the interpretation that be best for humanity . 
point : it be important to remember that the catholic church believe that barrier contraception be against god and that use it will condemn people to hell . therefore , even if the church's stance on condom be harmful , which the proposition do not accept that it be , it be less harmful than people spend an eternity suffering . in this context , therefore , the most responsible thing for the catholic church to do be to forbid the use of condom and , thereby , save people from hell1 . 1 pope paul vi . humanae vitae . 1968 . 4 
counterpoint : this be a wilful interpretation of a highly ambiguous passage . the church's belief that barrier contraception be against god be base entirely on a single passage of the bible where onan be condemn for wilfully 'spilling his seed . '1importantly , the fact that he spill his seed alone be not even the main reason that he be condemn . it be well within the power of the catholic church to officially change their belief that use barrier contraception will send people to hell and allow it use . since the passage be ambiguous , the decision should be make base on what be best for society and the church a a whole . the opposition believe that in their main case they have prove that the church lift their ban on barrier method of contraception would be good for society and therefore they believe they have win the debate . 138 : 9 10 , the book of genesis , the bible .
