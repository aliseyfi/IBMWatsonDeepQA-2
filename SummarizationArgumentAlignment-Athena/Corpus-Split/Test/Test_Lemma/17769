point : hosting the olympics , or any other global sport event , be a huge prize for any nation , give them huge international prestige and attention , and repressive regime do not deserve to be by be give the chance to host the game . as the most recent repressive regime to host the game china be a good example . china be a communist dictatorship which maintain tight political control over it 1 . 3 billion people . all power be focus in the hand of the chinese communist party , and those who call for the introduction of democratic election be arrest and jail . as the then senator obama argue , it be past time for china to respect the human right of the tibetan people miller , 2008 . instead china use the game a a come out party to show the power of the state . with the exception of the ussr in 1980 , every post war olympics have be host by a democratic country and this have help to promote democracy a a desirable norm for successful state . many democratic country refuse to send team to the moscow olympics and while country do not feel they could do the same with china in 2008 the principle remain the same we should not lend our support to legitimize dictatorship through sport . 
counterpoint : sports event be as much about the people a they be about the regime , a boycott serve only to punish the people for their leader crime . xujun eberlein email a relative in china to ask about local reaction to call for a boycott , to which his relative respond they the boycotting state be try every way to find problem with china , pick bone from egg yolk eberlein , 2007 . a boycott in this case would only fasten the chinese people tie to the government eberlein , 2007 . repressive regime should not be reward , but a boycott offer just that , so let s attend the olympics but in way that will call attention to chinese complicity in genocide , in way that will embarrass the chinese government but not the people kristof , 2007 . 
point : when country do not rise to the occasion offer by sport event and clean up their act they deserve to be boycott . in the case of the 2008 game china have a terrible human right record so in order to win the games in 2001 , china promise the ioc that it would improve it human right record , but these promise be not keep . thousands of political prisoner continue to suffer in chinese jail and labour camp with a quarter of a million people imprison without trial . journalists be among those detain in this way , and the regime run a huge censorship operation cover all form of medium include the internet despite promise of unprecedented openness to the medium in the run up to and during the game . once a state have be award the game there be little the award body can do to encourage the state to keep to it promise . when a state do not improve we cannot show our approval by send a team to the olympics like the free world do in 1936 , miss the opportunity to use the limelight of the games to make an issue of germany s deepen persecution of jews tkacik jr . , 2007 . 
counterpoint : hosting the olympics be contributes to the open up of repressive regime and help to improve human right . this have be the case with china , just a it do twenty year ago in south korea . susan brownell , who have study the effect of the event on china , write that the olympics will speed up the formation of a civil society in urban china by as much a 5 10 year us information service , 2007 . the sign be already there ; some political prisoner have be free in the past year and the government be take advice from country such a britain about improve it justice system . already it have be announce that the usual restriction on foreign journalist will be loosen during the beijing games . in any case , many of the country which attack china and others over human right be hardly above criticism themselves what of america s record with hundred of thousand of death in iraq and afghanistan follow it invasion ? what about guantanamo bay ? 
point : the olympics be a celebration of international cooperation and peace . this mean that they should not go to state that don t live up to this . china be not a responsible actor on the global stage . many group like the heritage foundation cautiously welcome the granting of the game to china a an opportunity to compel beijing to adopt true olympic value but they have be leave disappointed tkacik jr . , 2007 . its support prop up dictatorial regime in sudan , zimbabwe , myanmar and north korea , offer them loan , aid investment and military support , all of which democratic country have decide to withhold in protest against their repressive treatment of their own people . china have also use it veto on the united nations security council to prevent concerted international sanction be apply against these rogue state . deciding to boycott the olympics when it be be host by regime that do not uphold the value of the game , and would apply pressure both on the host and others to act more responsibly in future . 
counterpoint : having potential troublemaker host the olympics will improve international peace and cooperation . these state will be unwilling to cause any problem in the year between get the game and host them a they will want the event to show them in the best light possible . this can be show by china s peaceful rise over the twenty year before host the game during which it avoid use military force . it have not invade other country without un authorisation . instead it be cooperate with it neighbour , both in south east and in central asia , and seek to promote a multi polar world where no dominant state can dictate to others . china become more actively involve in seek solution to international problem such a sudan and north korea , for example by vote in august 2007 to send a un peacekeeping force to darfur . a successful olympics add to these positive global contribution and do much to reinforce it constructive approach to international affair in the future . 
point : the sport body that pick athlete for the world s major sport event can be dictate to by their respective government . as the sport body would ultimately be represent their state , not their sporting body , they need the approval of the government in question before they can compete . furthermore , a much of the funding both the sport and their participation in the event be provide by the state , they must heed to the state s decision . if the government in question rule that the regime host the event be not deserve of the attention and credence bestow on successful host , it have the ability to order it sport body and athlete to not travel . 
counterpoint : states can prevent their own contingent participate , but they can t prevent the sport event go ahead , nor the inevitable boost to the regime s image that result . in so do , the boycott state risk come across a not the arbiter of morality but a government unwilling to separate politics from sport and let athlete compete . furthermore , with little evidence to suggest that boycott have any positive benefit in term of open up the regime itself , there be scope to argue the opposite that compete in the event be the most effective mean of reduce state repression . in beijing in 2008 for instance , the gaze of the world s medium ensure that state crackdown during the game themselves be restrain to ensure that the sport remain the centrepiece .
