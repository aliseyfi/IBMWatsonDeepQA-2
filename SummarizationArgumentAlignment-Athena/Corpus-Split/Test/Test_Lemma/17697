point : the lisbon treaty and the constitution have 96 of the same text . former french president val√©ry giscard d estaing , who write the original eu constitution , have publicly state that the lisbon treaty be essentially the same a the propose constitution 1 . the decision from country not to hold referendum in 2007 that they have previously agree to be a flagrant disregard for the wish of the people . moreover the decision to ratify the lisbon treaty through national parliament in france and the netherlands where the 2004 treaty be reject in popular vote demonstrate that the decision not to hold referendum be in the fear that they would be reject when put to the people . any decision that be force through parliament in the fear that it would fail when open to the citizen of that country lack legitimacy . 
counterpoint : the decision not to hold a referendum be not one take against the wish of the people . firstly , citizen of france and the netherlands , who vote no to the constitution in public vote , accept the decision to not repeat a referendum in 2007 . furthermore , the accusation that the two text be 96 identical be a crude one that ignore the fundamental difference in mean that a few word can make 1 therefore the decision to not hold a referendum to ratify the lisbon treaty should not be see in conjunction with the result of the constitution referendum . this demonstrate that the decision not to hold a referendum be not against the people's wish : it be largely accept that accept constitutional change through the elected national parliament be democratically acceptable . 
point : the lisbon treaty significantly affect the working of each member country . it give the european union a legal personality , allow it to sign international agreement and member country be now make subject to majority vote 1 . the lisbon treaty do not only affect international policy , criminal law and national justice system , it also give power over to the commission and european court . such major change must be put to popular vote , the citizen of each eu member state have a right to legitimise or reject these change that push for a more centralized european superstate . furthermore the will of the people need to be trust , if a reform be intentionally ambiguous and complicate , which be one of the criticism of the lisbon treaty 2 , it be the job of the politician to explain the cause to the public . voters should be include in the debate and key issue need to be highlight not just ignore . 
counterpoint : the lisbon treaty be limit in significance and have less problematic superstate aspect that the constitutional treaty of 2004 such a an official flag , anthem and bill of citizen's right 1 . the constitution want to find the european union on an entirely new basis , whereas the lisbon treaty be a conventional amending treaty . it be this fundamental difference that justify the lack of referendum for the lisbon treaty when it be essential for the ratification of the constitution . however the association with the previous treaty would have see the public wary and progress stifle a a result . the lisbon treaty be more concerned with technical reform than constitutional significance and therefore do not need the ratification of the national electorate . the result of a referendum be more likely to reflect public opinion on the current government than on the propose reform . furthermore on important foreign policy issue the elected government be well informed to make decision than the electorate 2 . 
point : decisions that affect the national sovereignty of a country should not just be leave to elect politician who have power for a limited time but should be give to the citizen through direct vote . the nature of the lisbon treaty change the relationship between member state and brussels ; it be clearly a constitutional issue and therefore need to be ratify by all citizen . the blair labour government hold referendum on a whole range of constitutional change , include not only devolution in scotland , wales and northern ireland , but even on whether individual city should have directly elect mayor 
counterpoint : democracy itself be the delegating of decision making to elect official and this be exactly what have take place in the government's decision to not hold referendum but pas change through national parliament . referenda undermines democracy by negate the representative government and parliamentary sovereignty , they have be choose a the representative of the people , by the people , and therefore have the right to make informed decision on their behalf about what to do in the nation's best interest . if there be long term issue with a government's decision then they can be make accountable at the next general election . 
point : when ask why they reject the referendum for the constitution the french and dutch public say that they have not be consult before on eu integration and thus felt alienate from the european union . citizens of europe will continue to feel alienate from the eu unless their government allow them great participation1 . in britain tony blair's labour government promise a referendum for the propose eu constitution so that the british people could 'make an historic choice about the uk's place in europe' , this be meet with cross party and public support a this be the first time that british voter have be ask their opinion since the 1975 referendum on eec membership . 
counterpoint : a referendum would not alter the underlying reason for alienation . citizens feel alienate from the eu because of distinct cultural difference between country ; a referendum would not solve this but could allow prejudice to surface and thus damage relation between european country . furthermore in the case of britain , hold a referendum could damage the uk's standing in the eu if the vote be negative .
