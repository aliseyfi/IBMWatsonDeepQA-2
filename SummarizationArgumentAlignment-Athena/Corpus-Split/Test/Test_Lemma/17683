point : the philosopher peter singer propose what have be call the greater moral evil rule : if we can prevent something bad without sacrifice anything of comparable significance , we ought to do it . from this first premise singer argue that absolute poverty be bad and that there be some absolute poverty we can prevent without sacrifice anything of comparable significance . therefore , we ought to prevent some absolute poverty . this argument can be modify to cover a large variety of thing which one might call 'charity' . 
counterpoint : as much a singer want u to give . giving away a huge portion of one's money seem require heroic self sacrifice . it be also different in that we do not always know whether or not our money will contribute to save a life . maybe it will pay for administration or be waste or fill the pocket of bureaucrat . it be far more callous to kill someone who you can see suffering and who be in your presence . we cannot expect people to have empathy for every human alive . we should only hold people responsible for problem that they help to cause . wealthy people do not help to cause poverty and so can't be hold responsible for solve it . 
point : many people gain from give to charity . it improve self esteem , alleviate guilt , and ensure religious or cultural guideline that be important to you be meet . they also contribute towards tax break . acting in such an ethical manner therefore have numerous effect on other aspect of life . microsoft founder bill gates , who have give billion to his own charity , describe give his money back a make him feel 'very fortunate' and 'thrilled'1 . 
counterpoint : there be numerous way people can feel well about themselves without have to give up money to a charity . whilst one could give money to a charity that provide support to the poor and disadvantage , he or she could just a easily use their wealth to start a business or expand a current one , provide job that will do a great deal more for the jobless than a package from a charity . furthermore , the knowledge that one's business have give a job to someone poor and in desperate need of work will do far more for their self esteem than sign a cheque to a charity . similarly , send a cheque when one could , with a bit more effort or courage , create a job would only increase guilt rather than alleviate it . 
point : the wealth gap be strongly correlate to crime . in order to make one's own society safer one ought to give generously to charity that support the poor . in the united states in 2008 , 37 of black high school dropout be incarcerate ; if more money be give to charity that support the poor sector of society that be the most likely to drop out , crime rate would inevitably come down . for example , of those black student who do make it to college , only 2 be incarcerate . the pattern be uniform across all race in the united states , the longer they stay in school , and therefore the more chance they have of find a job , the less chance of end up in prison1 . 
counterpoint : giving aid to foreign country do not decrease the wealth gap , nor do care for the elderly . one cannot singlehandedly reduce the wealth gap by send money to improve the condition in an orphanage . one be more likely to reduce the wealth gap by develop the company in which one work so that more worker can be employ and pay high wage . it be not necessarily the case that by behave charitably you be likely to receive charity in the future . people be selfish and we do not live in small village any longer where there be a high degree of reciprocity . people tend to fall on hard time when there be a widespread economic recession in which case people be highly unlikely to behave charitably . 
point : while we live in a materialist culture where it be often felt necessary to gather more and more stuff , often dispose of other item a we go along it be also very easy to give . there be thousand of charity that allow u to give to the needy either in term of give cash or our time and skill . these charity do work in all sort of activity , from debate education like the international debate education association , to feed the starving like oxfam . in many case we can give in local store as well a online or by post . those in the rich world also have lot of disposable income that they can give away . toby ord , a university researcher show that it be possible to give away a lot to charity while not on an income that be particularly large by the standard of the developed world . he give away over a third of his income of 25000 and still have plenty to live on . ord believe that everyone in the rich world should give away a tenth of their earnings1 . 
counterpoint : it be not easy to reject the whole of materialist culture in order to give large amount of one's income away to charity . ord be notable and come up in the bbc magazine precisely because it be so unusual for someone to be willing to give so much away . many people on 25 , 000 be use up almost all their money on living expense , especially if they be look after elderly relative or bring up child .
