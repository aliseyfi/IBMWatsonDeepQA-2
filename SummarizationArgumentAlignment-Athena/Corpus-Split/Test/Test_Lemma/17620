point : the criminologist peter moskos i observe that most of u , if give the choice , would opt to receive ten lash rather than spend five year in prison . paradoxically , a significant number of u would condemn corporal punishment a barbaric and inhumane . if imprisonment be a more rational response to criminal behaviour , why would so many rational individual opt to receive corporal punishment ? 
counterpoint : what pretend to be an argument in support of the resolution be in fact an argument in favour of reform the prison system . it be true that in an alarming number of prison the rehabilitative objective of incarceration have be forget . in many other prison , however , innovative rehabilitation programme be flourish . the prison system be not a monolith it be a network of different institution , each serve a specific purpose , each subject to different standard of management . schemes such a the hope honest opportunity probation drug offence sentence programme in hawaii i should be use a an example of best practice , communicate to other prison and replicate in other jurisdiction . 
point : even though liberal democratic system of justice continue to place an emphasis on punishment rather than rehabilitation , sentence be still require to be proportionate to the crime that they punish . further , a sentence must only punish those judge responsible for the crime . collective punishment and guilt by association be not tolerate within rational , liberal system of criminal law . 
counterpoint : through their action , career criminal and drug offender often subject their family to misery far in excess of the temporary absence of a loved one , or transient financial hardship . the damaging process of take drug and support a habit be normalise for child live with addict ; child expose to drug in this way be much more likely to develop an addiction themselves . criminals who make a business out of thievery may use the family home to store acquisition . wives and member of an extended family may be coerce into trading steal good . offenders who trade drug or store steal good in lease or social housing risk eviction if their activity be discover . this , in turn , would lead to their family be displace or leave homeless . siblings and parent of gang member can often be the target of violence result from feud and territorial dispute . 
point : a custodial sentence be capable of destroy the relationship and livelihood of an offender . imprisonment mean that an offender will be unable to work and will lose his job , if he have one . statistics source from the pew foundation indicate that a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a black , male american secure a job by up to 57 1 . the isolation inherent in imprisonment can lead to the breakup of marriage and to the decay of relationship between parent and child . the stigma associate with a custodial sentence may result in an offender be shun by his friend , his family and his community . he will , in effect , be leave with no source of support once he be release . a former inmate will be leave with no incentive to adjust his behaviour and disengage with criminality2 . the pew foundation note that 43 of offender in the united states be return to prison within three year of release1 . 
counterpoint : rehabilitation programme be not a panacea nor be they instantly or reliably effective . the risk of an individual committing crime can only be reduce by long term engagement with reform scheme . in 2009 violation of parole the rule , condition and scheme offender be require to engage with on be release from prison lead to a third of all state prison admission in the united states i . 
point : the failure of the prison system be tolerate within political culture and by the public , partly because the privation of the prison environment be see a a suitable punishment for criminal behaviour . deprivation of liberty and the emptiness of criminal life be see a retribution for criminals' dishonest or violent activity . 
counterpoint : while the conservative press may advocate the reintroduction of corporal sentence , an equally vocal section of society would condemn any attempt to use flogging a a mean of punishment . the inherently pragmatic political discourse that prevail in most liberal democracy would be a reluctant to replace prison with the lash a it currently be to reduce prison population and confront under investment in rehabilitation scheme .
