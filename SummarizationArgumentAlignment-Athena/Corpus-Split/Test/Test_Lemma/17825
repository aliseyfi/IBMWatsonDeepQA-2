point : a high number of student fail to succeed in language be not a valid reason to make the subject optional . this mentality open the gate to make english and math option , simply to eradicate the effort of improve pas rate . the british broadcasting corporation bbc report that in the uk a quarter of secondary pupil age 11 and over fail to reach their potential in math s and a quarter be make insufficient progress in english . 1 still , optional english and math be unthinkable ; these be core subject language should also be consider a such . those who want to transfer student energy from foreign language to english be ignore the possibility that learn a foreign language may actually be useful for learn the first language . 2 students fail in core subject must be help to improve , not have the subject eradicate . 
counterpoint : the overwhelming number of student who struggle with reading and write in their own language cannot be expect to acquire a second , foreign one . the vast number of student fail to master basic arithmetic and competency in their mother language be to be address a a matter of urgency . this be a primary concern for school , not second language learning . 
point : languages be extremely beneficial to the economy in two sens . firstly , language skill improve a job candidate s chance of selection , which keep unemployment down . the national centre for languages cilt report on it website that 36 of employer recruit people with language , 49 of employer be dissatisfy with school leaver language skill and that 95 of london employer think that language skill be important for the london economy . 1 secondly , a high number of employee with language skill enhance company abilities to engage in trade and to expand their business abroad , in turn enhance export . 
counterpoint : languages be not the only economically beneficial skill ; science , law , humanity , creative study be favourable . however , skill alone be not enough ; people with hand on experience in their field be need to work a stable economy . it be immoral that a government make it people take post use language that aid the country s economy and not the individual s job satisfaction . at the same time in term of benefit to the economy of their home country those who have study language be more likely to work abroad constitute a brain drain . 
point : the call for student to learn a foreign language not only stem from economic need but also from the need of improved security and diplomacy , in particular a good understanding of culture and language in order to good understand threat to the state and improve foreign service be need . 1 in many anglophone country even in the role of a diplomat there be worry number who do not have the language skills they need , for example in canada only 16 of the 180 foreign service officer who be require to have advance foreign language skill for their position , could speak the needed language . 2 as a 2007 national academy of science report warn u the pervasive lack of knowledge of foreign language and culture threaten the security of the united state as well a it ability to compete in the global marketplace and produce an unformed citizenry . 3 since the increased security post 9 11 the government accountability office gao have report that there be a shortage of foreign language expertise within the government and for this reason may undermine national security . 
counterpoint : again , language be not the only skill that government official be require to possess in order to ensure that a state be able to adequately protect it citizen and it border from foreign threat . those with knowledge and experience work in different state of different culture can use this to enhance knowledge available to the government or official . people of different background be also employ in order to gain insight and for this reason a varied skill set of experience and knowledge can work together in secure a state . 
point : the problem student face when learning language be the fault of teach method , not language ability . madeline ehrman observe that the root of this problem be that the student be out of sync with the methodology , the teacher . therefore , the antidote be more modern learning style ; there be some quick fix that can be make when adaptation be need . 1 languages should not be abandon when student find them bore rather the curriculum and method of teach need to be change to make the learning more interesting and more relevant . for example student struggle even with their own grammar so an emphasis on make themselves understood rather than correct grammar may be more useful . 
counterpoint : it be still a mystery why , a robert c . gardner put it that some people can learn a second or foreign language so easily and so well and while others , give what seem to be the same opportunity to learn find it almost impossible ? 1 no audio visual suite , no matter how high tech and expensive , will be able to raise the grade of student who find it impossible to hold the complexity of grammar rule in their head . 
point : to refuse to learn foreign language be narrow mind , ignorant and blinker . language be a mean not only of assert identity but , more importantly of heritage culture maintenance . to refuse to learn a foreign language be to disallow anyone s culture apart from one s own to be upheld . when this happen , the dominant group force ethnic group into particular niche . 1 this be particularly likely to be a problem in multicultural society or indeed any society that be not homogeneous . by refuse to learn foreign language , one refuse to recognise that other culture even exist . 
counterpoint : learning it target language be not fundamental to embrace any foreign culture . many people can be very open to foreign culture without learn their language s . indeed it may be necessary for most to keep the two separate . 1 no one can learn every foreign language and many would not have the time to learn more than a few but that should not prevent learn about and enjoy that culture , it music , it art and even in many case through translation it literature . 
point : students should have a fundamental freedom of choice when it come to all but the most necessary subject . if student want to specialise in for example science and drop foreign language in order to be able to do this then they should have this option , a choice which be likely to be beneficial for their chosen career . students progress in their most successful subject should not be hinder by the burden of language learning . it be not the case that student do not desire to engage in language because they be lazy , narrow mind or blinker . rather , because they demonstrate real strength in other subject they do not wish to be constrain in those subject by one where they do not excel . 
counterpoint : allowing student to study what they want or what they consider themselves to be good at would be a mistake . the point of education before university be to provide a good broad grounding that provide all the necessary life skill . this have to include hard subject that would not be the first choice of the student . in the uk it have be suggest that the high pas rate for soft subject like media studies of 98 have help cause a decline in foreign language learning at a level 16 18 year old . 1 scientific research have show how a second language can aid u past school year , for example the american association for the advancement of science s late research show the symptom of alzheimer s to occur later on in life in those who be bilingual in comparison to those who speak one language . the ability to speak more than one language enable people to communicate good and for long . 2
