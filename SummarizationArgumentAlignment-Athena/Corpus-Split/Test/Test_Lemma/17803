point : the resident of area where shale gas be find and drilling may occur have a right to maintain their health , something which drilling may affect . dangerous chemical be pump into rock formation that be also the source of groundwater for million of people . in 2008 a hydrologist find benzene in a water well in wyoming above where fracking be occur . 1 dramatic film of inflammable gas leaking through drinking water pipe underline the risk pose by this uncontrolled experiment under our home . 2 companies be in denial over these danger , but their refusal to come clean about exactly what chemical they be use be hardly reassuring . while there be a chance that live be at risk , either from water contamination or from gas explosion a a result of the fracking such risky method of extract natural gas should be ban . 
counterpoint : shale gas extraction be environmentally responsible and safe for human health . 95 or more of the fluid pump into well a part of the fracking process be ordinary water , and most of the remain 5 be naturally occur sand , vegetable guar a gum derive from bean and nitrogen . 1 these be pumped deep underground in order to stimulate the release of gas , and then remove again at the well head a part of the extraction process . any fracking fluid leave within the rock be so far underground that there be no danger of any contamination of groundwater source . in the uk the environment agency s staff consider that there be a very low risk from these chemical because there be no groundwater in or around the deep shale formation and there be a low risk of the chemical migrate upwards and have an adverse impact on the environment . 2 indeed , no evidence have ever be present of the fracking fluid get into the water supply and if they do they could equally come from other consumer and industrial application of the fluid , 3 while the gas could have occur naturally . 
point : given that some of the negative consequence from hydraulic fracture process may take many year to emerge , the precautionary principle should be apply . applying the precautionary principle would mean change the burden of proof from environmentalist have to prove that fracking do cause harm in each circumstance to it be the oil and gas firm who have to prove that fracking be safe . 1 as a result fracking should be stop all together or at the very least greatly reduce the amount of fracking leave only a few field in operation so that the effect of the process can be study and a a result sufficient legislation but in place to regulate the industry . 2 until it can be prove these method be entirely safe , hydraulic fracturing should be stop and the shale gas industry deny far drilling permit . 
counterpoint : the precautionary principle simply want cost effective measure to prevent environmental degradation . 1 this do not mean that fracking should have to stop in order to apply the principle . rather a the oil and gas company be already do wherever possible preventing environmental degradation . the european commission say that the precautionary principle should never justify arbitrary decision . 2 but that be exactly what it would be do if it be invoke to ban a whole industry just because we do not know every consequence of fracking . 
point : expanding shale gas extraction would be very damaging to the environment a the process require a large number of small well to be drill in each gas field , ohio for example have 80 , 000 fracked well 1 , by comparison only 10 , 000 have be drill in the uk part of the north sea since 1964 . 2 this mean beautiful rural area will be spoil by the presence of many gas rig , each with it accompany pipe , building , track , etc . agricultural and amenity land will be lose and wildlife disturbed . and heavy construction traffic will ruin road and create noise pollution for nearby resident . 
counterpoint : all form of energy production place some burden on the environment , but compare to any other form of fossil fuel shale gas be limit in it impact . it do not produce huge open cast pit like tar sand or level mountain like coal mining , it do not need massive offshore rig like oil well or traditional gas extraction , and it do not pose the risk of oil spill like those in the gulf of mexico and the niger delta . indeed , many people also object to renewable energy source such a massive solar array , rank of noisy wind turbine against the horizon , or hydro electric scheme that drown valley and wreck river system . with proper regulation , the impact of shale gas well can be make acceptable to local community , while good horizontal drilling technique mean few well will be require in the future than in the past , in alaska horizontal drilling have mean that well be only need every four mile . 1 
point : climate change be the big problem face our planet and it require urgent action for u to shift to a low carbon economy . shale gas be simply another fossil fuel , release carbon into the atmosphere when it be burnt to provide power . as the tyndall centre warn while it be possible that shale gas could substitute for coal , within the uk , this would likely be counteract by global use of coal and shale gas . 1 so rather than replace even dirty coal a a source of power , it be likely simply to augment it , feed our wasteful society s insatiable appetite for energy . indeed , if shale gas lower the price of fossil fuel , it may contribute further to the problem by encourage a continue rise in energy consumption . 2 worse , by take investment from renewable energy source such a solar , tidal and wind energy , shale gas may postpone the necessary shift to a low carbon economy . 
counterpoint : shale gas provide an important route to a low carbon economy . burning gas to generate electricity for light house and power factory and also perhaps increasingly for power plug in automobile emits much less carbon than burn coal in traditional power station . at the same time , shale gas can provide much more energy in the next twenty year than renewable source such a solar , wind and tidal energy can at present offer . so if we be serious about shut down major polluter such a coal burn power station and petrol drive automobile , it be shale gas that can provide u with a realistic and affordable low carbon solution . even if target for renewable generation of electricity be meet there will still need to be electricity generation by other source and gas be the best option . 1 the environmental case for shale gas can be far strengthen by the use of carbon sequestration whereby new technology be employ to capture the carbon emission a gas be burnt and to store it in underground rock formation , so that it be not release into the atmosphere , lawrence livermore national laboratory be even research how to do this in shale . 2
