point : it be practically unfeasible for the government to continue imprison people at this rate when prison be already over capacity 1 2 . sooner or later , we will have to accept that there be too great a burden on our prison facility for this kind of sentence to continue be use in so many case . as such , we should give priority to imprison criminal who be genuinely dangerous and who have prove their violent tendency already . these kind of offence be the most traumatic for victim 3 and we owe it to them to make sure that these criminal be physically distance from the rest of society . however , while non violent offender have also commit a crime , they do not pose the same kind of danger which require that they must be lock up ; in fact , those who commit small scale crime against society could be well rehabilitate by be force to work to improve society through thing like community service they will be less likely to damage a society which they feel a part of and have help to build 4 . when people hold a great stake in their community , they value it more and be reluctant to damage it 5 . 
counterpoint : allowing non violent offender to walk free be not the only option we have in the face of an overstretch prison system . for a start , we could just build more prison . the potential cost of this , however great , be less damage to society than allow powerful drug dealer or fraudsters to continue undermine the law and intimidate citizen be they be allow to move freely within society . measures such a curfew still allow these criminal to move freely through society for a large proportion of the day 1 , during which there remain little to deter them from continue criminal activity , especially when the punishment they have already receive have be so lenient . in case of electronic tagging , even if the curfew be breach , the first instance incur only a warning 2 . this be too lenient for people who have break the law . 
point : those who advocate prison sentence for non violent offender often state two point : first , that the idea of be send to prison be think to act a a deterrent , and prevent people from commit crime ; second , that people have do commit crime and go to prison be less likely to re offend . this be false on both count . the idea of prison a a deterrent be immediately disprove by a rise violent crime rate 1 2 , and the argument that these prisoner will not re offend be disprove by the high rate of re offending after a prison sentence , reach up to 70 for some prison 3 4 . moreover , re offend statistic be normally only base on crime commit within a year of release 5 ; there may be many , many more ex prisoner who re offend who be not record within these statistic . crimes which be commit impulsively and without forethought be rarely deter by the possibility of punishment or be catch 6 . 
counterpoint : this argument be weaken by the fact that it be often violent criminal who have high rate of recidivism 1 , in which case this mechanism would have place them in prison anyway . while impulsive crime such a petty theft might not be deter by the prospect of a prison sentence , highly organised and long term crime such a fraud and drug offence might well find prison to be a deterrent in fact , one of the reason that drug crime be particularly prevalent be that the number of drug arrest be comparatively low in many country in relation to the total number of user 2 . if arrest and sentence be a more constant threat to these crime , instead of a distant and unlikely chance , prison could become a true deterrent to crime of this nature . 
point : sentencers have a wide array of option in their sentencing , and indeed the sentence council state that sentence should never be a rigid , mechanistic or scientific process 1 . they have the option to make sentence more proportional to the crime commit , and it be logical that the more serious crime should receive the most serious sentence in this case , imprisonment 2 . other option for sentence could include fine , unpaid work , rehabilitation programme , alcohol or drug treatment , curfew and supervision requirement 3 . one key aim of sentence be to convey moral censure , and to encourage offender to truly consider the implication of their action 4 . however , offender who feel that they have be punish too severely or treat unfairly , or that those who have commit bad crime receive the same sentence , be less likely to respond to that moral message and benefit from it 5 . this subsequently damage a key pillar of the criminal justice system the idea of rehabilitation 6 . criminals who see themselves a unfairly treat by society have no reason not to strike out against society again by commit another crime . not only would alternative form of punishment prevent this from happen , but it do not require the availability of prison and so be less of a burden on resource . heavier fine , long community sentence and more strict curfew can easily be give a an appropriate sentence for non violent offender . 
counterpoint : any moral message which sentencing be intend to convey also become lose when the sentence be too lenient . just because a crime in non violent doesn t mean it isn t incredibly serious . large scale fraud or drug offense be capable of seriously affect society ; perhaps not by direct physical violence , but more subtly , perhaps by make a particular neighbourhood unsafe because of the prominence of drug 1 , or damage a family s ability to sustain itself by cheat them out of money 2 . certainly , if drug trafficking cause people to become tempt into drug and subsequently addict , it can cause an enormous physical harm to that individual 3 . these crime also damage society by flaunt the rule of law and undermine law which be put in place for society s protection . though these crime may not be directly physically violent , they should not be underestimate ; in many case , crime such a drug trafficking and fraud require more forethought and plan than a crime of passion such a assault which might be sincerely regret by the perpetrator . 
point : merely have a criminal record which state that an individual be imprison , rather than give a more productive sentence such a community service , can have enormous implication on that individual s future employment opportunity 1 . this be particularly pertinent if it be a first offence , commit in a moment of stupidity . prisons be an isolating factor which separate the offender from their friend and family and distance them even far from the rest of society 2 . this create a cycle of crime 3 where the offender s close acquaintance be those who they meet in prison , rather than a supportive network of family and friend who can help this person to be reintegrate into society . not only do prison allow prisoner to share criminal idea 4 , but it may also reciprocally validate their illegal action by create a sense of camaraderie . this make rehabilitation , and recognition of society s moral value , much more difficult . ultimately , use prison for non violent offence only introduce the offender to more serious crime , and make it more difficult for the offender themselves to be reintegrate , and for wide society to reintegrate them . 
counterpoint : prisons must be an isolating factor because we recognise that crime be often commit with the help of friend or accomplice , particularly in the case of drug deal 1 . the offender must be cut off from their associate to prevent these crime from continue while they be imprison . furthermore , while prison may create a sense of camaraderie among inmate , it be much more a force for good . this sense of community actually make it easy for them to reintegrate into society 2 , while share idea stop the sense of personal isolation from the rest of the world 3 . prison provide both a punishment for the crime commit an the first step of rehabilitation by give prisoner a sense of community .
