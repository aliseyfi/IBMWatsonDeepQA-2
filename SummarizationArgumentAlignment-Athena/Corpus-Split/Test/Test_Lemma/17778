point : fossils allow u a glimpse into the development of life on earth . fossils show a development from early , less complex form of life , through to newer , more complex form of life , with characteristic develop from early organism . this progression be strong evidence for evolution . since fossilization be a rare event , there be some gap in the fossil record , but all the available evidence be consistent with , and fully explain by , evolution . 1 
counterpoint : there be an absence of transitional fossil . the evidence for miss link between different specie be itself miss . fossils be jumble up , rather than order from simple to complex . 1 
point : evidence from many different discipline show that the earth be very old , allow enough time for life a it exist today to evolve and contradict a creationist belief in a young earth . 
counterpoint : secular scientist extrapolate the age of the earth backwards from examine current natural process , but they assume that they have always take place at the same speed and for the same reason , but this be not necessarily the case . 
point : evolutionary theory be open to change and be in principle falsifiable : if enough evidence be find , scientist would change their view . scientists make their reputation by make new discovery , so if evolution could be disprove , someone would have do it , but it be still stand after over 150 year of research since darwin , show how strong it be . 1 
counterpoint : creationism make empirical claim , such a that the earth be less than 10 , 000 year old . the use of scientific argument against these claim show that creationism be in fact falsifiable . 1
