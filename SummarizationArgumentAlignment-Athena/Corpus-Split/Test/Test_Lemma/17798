point : having child be such an important aspect of most people s live that it should be consider a right . for many people , their status a parent be a key part of their identity , and their devotion towards their child be indicative of how important parenting be to them . the right to start a family be recognize in article 12 of the european convention on human rights and article 16 of the universal declaration of human rights . 
counterpoint : the state give every human be the right to reproduce , which be not equal with a right to become a parent by all mean . 
point : if the state fund ivf treatment , it would overcome some of the inefficiency involve in expensive medical treatment . costs would be bring down a economy of scale be exploit , and state health service have good bargain power when it come to purchase large order of drug and equipment . a high rate of treatment within the population would increase safety and improve outcome thus reduce cost , a medical department become more experienced . most significantly , an asymmetry of information exists between doctor and patient a it do with all medical treatment patient be not aware of what service they need , and be unable to weigh up the various option available to them , because do so require medical training . this drive up price , a doctor have incentive to over treat patient , and not to treat patient in the most cost effective manner . providing state funding would make the state the purchaser of ivf service or even the direct provider of them , remove either the ability to over treat or the incentive to do so depend on whether the state be the buyer or the provider . 
counterpoint : the state could reduce the cost of all kind of good and service by use it market power to drive down price . there be even other non medical service that suffer from the asymmetry of information problem describe by the proposition , such a car maintenance , audio visual equipment , and health food supplement . nobody advocate the state intervening in these market , so what be special about healthcare ? 
point : most couple which decide to do ivf treatment do not have unlimited fund available to them . therefore , once they decide to do ivf treatment in order to reduce the cost of more cycle , couple and clinician with only private fund typically opt to implant numerous embryo , hop at least one will survive . 
counterpoint : such practice a implant more embryo , know it could lead to complication and more health issue for the patient be immoral regardless if in private of public sector . under the hippocratic oath physician should any way stick to the principle of first , do no harm . 1 the problem of the multiple implant can be very easily solve by put new legislation in place that would forbid more embryo at the same time and in this way make procedure safer for the patient in the private and publically fund sector . 
point : there be benefit to the state in promote fertility treatment and so encouraging more people to have child . most developed country have rapidly age population with too few young people to be able to maintain their pension system over the next thirty year . to avert demographic crisis government need to do more to encourage couple to start family . many state already support couple who have child through the benefit system ; some like italy even pay a lump sum to couple on the birth of each child . funding ivf to increase the number of birth be an obvious extension of this principle . it would also be right for society through the state to fund ivf , a career expectation and the high cost of housing force many couple now delay start a family until they be in their thirty , by which time they may need medical help to conceive . 
counterpoint : although individual country may have demographic problem , overall the world need to restrain population growth . there be something hypocritical about developed country encourage poor one to promote family planning and small family , while fund ivf to increase the number of birth at home . ultimately rich country will have to be more open to immigration if they want to fix their demographic problem . in any case , provide ivf will make no significant impact on the actual birth rate in developed country , but will impose high medical cost on the state .
