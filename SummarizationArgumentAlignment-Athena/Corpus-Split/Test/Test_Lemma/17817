point : the military operation be a legitimate use of the israeli state s right to defend itself and it citizen : to quote then president elect barack obama if somebody be send rocket into my house where my two daughter sleep at night , i would do everything to stop that , and would expect israel to do the same thing . 1 
counterpoint : israel similarly violate the ceasefire prior to 2008 , and have unlawfully kidnap and imprison hundred of palestinians . furthermore , israel's attack on gaza be not an act of last resort . israel could and should have try to negotiate a truce with hamas base on the following principle : an end to the israeli siege on gaza in exchange for an end to hamas lead rocket attack on israel . this be the deal hamas offer israel before operation cast lead be launch . israel should have accept hamas s offer and assess whether hamas s intention to be bind by it term be genuine before launch a military attack . 6 if an action isn't truly an act of last resort , it cannot be legitimately term 'self defense' , and so be not justify . hamas be prepare to enter into negotiation with israel and it be prepare to discuss the more intricate detail of the deal it have propose . its attempt to avoid conflict be commit and consistent enough to suggest that gaza s leader be not engage in diplomatic posturing or sabre rattling . israel target more than just military target , include un warehouse hold medical and food supply , un school , and hospital . its imprecise tactic and refusal to allow access of humanitarian worker show that it be not merely self defense . 
point : as michael oren and yossi klein haleviargue explain , the israeli public will not make territorial concession on the west bank or the golan heights if gaza be allow to become a neighboring terrorist state that can launch attack with impunity . israel have already have a bad enough experience let that happen with hezbollah in southern lebanon . 1 without the assurance that they will be allow to protect their home and family follow withdrawal , israelis will rightly perceive a two state solution a an existential threat . they will continue to share the left wing vision of coexistence with a peaceful palestinian neighbor in theory , but in reality will heed the right's warning of jewish powerlessness . 4 
counterpoint : the long term security of israel rest in a stable peace agreement with the palestinians , not in attempt to bludgeon hamas into a truce 'on israel's terms' . to the extent that israel's large scale assault on gaza eliminate the hope of such an agreement , the attack worsen israel's long term security . 
point : operation cast lead be justify a it be proportionate to hamas' rocket attack against israel . it should be remember that 250 , 000 israelis living in the southern part of the country have live under year of terrorism before operation cast lead be launch , often in bomb shelter , and the economy have suffer . the world's medium may only have pay attention when israel respond to hamas' barrage , but this do not mean that israel be not already under severe attack by this point . 1 moreover , the israeli strike be rightly measure to disable hamas rocket attack . 11 
counterpoint : under the same logic , over 1 million resident of gaza have be under occupation since 1967 , face limited right of movement , regular air raid , military checkpoint , random search and seizure , random arrest , the destruction of sanitation facility , home , school , road , shop , market , and health facility , and therefore hamas have the right act in it own self defense by whatever mean it see fit . if palestinians do not have an army to call to it defense , how can the entire population be punish for the action of non state military group ?
