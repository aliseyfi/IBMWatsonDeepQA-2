point : the one child policy be often strictly enforce in china and many parent be give information about contraception to prevent any chance of an unplanned pregnancy . however a large number of pregnancy within any population be inevitable , despite the precaution that parent may take . whether a a result of defective medication , irresponsible behaviour , or simple bad luck , sufficiently frequent sexual activity will always lead to pregnancy . 
counterpoint : the chinese authority outlaw force abortion . the violation of human right be outlier and rarely occur . when they do they be punish badly . 
point : many asian culture have a preference for son over daughter due to tradition involve inheritance . further , in rural community a son be often preferable to a daughter simply because of the amount of work that they can do for the family . as well a this , son act a primary caregiver for the parent when they go into retirement and the son s parent be often treat good than the daughter s . 
counterpoint : the chinese authority be get good at prevent selective abortion of female since it be ban in 2005 . whilst the demographic change result from the one child policy be regrettable , they be ultimately what the chinese authority be seek from the one child policy . 40 million men who cannot marry be unlikely to have child and contribute to china s population problem . 
point : the one child policy be a policy that can be ignore fairly easily by rich people within china . through their ability to bribe official as well a their ability to hide extra child use foster parent and the like , it be easily possible for rich people to flout the one child policy . this have show itself in the form of many wealthy chinese official , entrepreneur and celebrity who have be catch ignore the one child policy . for example between 2000 and 2005 1968 government official in hunan violate the one child policy . 1 
counterpoint : the policy itself have no malicious intent and be not aim to harm different community to a different level . an argument about the rich ignore the one child policy be an argument for good regulation of the current policy , which be mean to be completely fair no matter a family s status or wealth , not the abolition of the policy itself .
