point : offering driver license to illegal immigrant make the street safer by give driver train to people who would otherwise be drive on the street without adequate education . unlicensed driver be five time more likely to get into a fatal crash than license driver 1 . 
counterpoint : it be very unlikely that illegal immigrant will even opt into this scheme . illegal immigrant be notoriously paranoid about go to the state for any form of assistance a they be afraid of deportation . the vast majority of them would rather risk get caught drive without a license then they would risk go to the state a an illegal to receive a license in the first place . 
point : insurance be a key component in make the street safe for all driver on the road . allowing illegal immigrant to get driver s license allow them to gain driver s insurance . 
counterpoint : this be a marginal impact at best . the vast majority of illegal immigrant will try to flee the scene of a crash because they would be worry that the police might be call in to investigate the crash and find out they be illegal and therefore deport them . although this isn t always a realistic expectation , it be an expectation that most people in the illegal immigrant community have because of their paranoia over the state pursue them and want to deport them . this fear be only exacerbate by the anti illegal immigrant rhetoric that permeate american society at present and make them feel that the state will try to seek them out however they can to get rid of them . 
point : drivers license be use a major form of identification in america and so granting illegal immigrant these form of identification can help enfranchise one of the most exploited minority in america . 
counterpoint : these people do not deserve to use the service of the usa . they be not citizen , they be law breaker and society have no obligation to make life easy or more comfortable for those who break the law . regardless of their contribution to society or the economy , illegal immigrant have break the law . the consequence of their breach of the law should be remedied . if necessary , illegal immigrant should be punish in proportion to the harm that their act have cause . under no circumstance should illegal act allow these individual to gain access to the status and legal privilege that citizenship confers .
