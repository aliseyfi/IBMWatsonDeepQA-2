point : international adoption provide orphan , often live in decrepit , under fund and unhygienic environment , a loving home in a developed society . child welfare expert appreciate that keep infant in institutional care for extend period of time put them at risk of lifelong damage1 . adopting parent be prove to be both financially and emotionally capable of both adopt and raise the child , ensure that the emotional heartache of grow up in an orphanage be replace by the stability of a home environment . this be advantageous , for obvious reason , for both child and parent , whilst the state from which the child be adopt be relieve of the financial pressure of support the orphan and the mother of the orphan can reassure herself that her child be be well look after . as a korean government official note regard the high adoption rate of korean child in the united states , 'in the beginning , the only reason foreign adoption be allow be that it be so difficult to raise child after the korean war'2 . in time of both financial austerity and societal breakdown , international adoption be a welcome relief , most of all to the unwanted child provide with a loving home and parental attention . 1 bartholet , e . international adoption : the human rights position . global policy , 2010 , p912 chira , s . babies for export : and now the painful questions . new york times 21 april 1998 2 
counterpoint : the proliferation of international adoption encourage parent to alleviate themselves of the responsibility of raise a child , increase the number of child in institutional care . parents , for less than admirable reason , be increasingly give their child up owe to the interest in international adoption . a study have show that the vast majority 96 of european child in so call 'orphanages' be not true orphan and have at least one parent , often know to the child welfare authority 1 . furthermore , the ostensible goal of international adoption to reduce the number of unwanted child do not correlate with the fact . results from a survey of european union state in 2008 show that 'countries with high proportion of outgo international adoption also have high number of young child in institutional care'1 . therefore , far from the positive effect on the adopted child , international adoption only encourage the removal of child from home environment and increase the number in institution . 1 chou , s . , browne , k . the relationship between instititutional care and the international adoption of chidren in europe . adoption and fostering , 2008 , pp . 41 42 
point : couples who have make the decision to adopt a child should not be restrict in their choice to their country of residence . it may be in the state's interest to reduce the number of child in their own institution , however there be no reason citizen should be straddle with this obligation . we do not prevent our adult from marry foreign national and grant them citizenship ; why would we do so for child ? furthermore , if the condition of the couples' state's institution be fairly good , they have a strong altruistic motive to adopt from a nation which do not fund it own institution similarly . unwanted or orphan child live in squalid condition in the developing world should be the priority for couple seek to adopt , not those live in the local orphanage who , whilst hop for a permanent home , will not starve . international adoption therefore would provide a small but tangible mean of reduce the infant mortality of many of these struggle state . 
counterpoint : couples seek to adopt must be restrict to their country of residence in order to prevent the establishment of a market for child need adoption and the undermining of the immigration system . most fundamentally however , a citizen be tie not merely to the state but to their other citizen , and they do have an obligation when they seek to adopt to help those child , their fellow citizen , who have yet to find a permanent , loving home and family . furthermore , if couple seek to adopt would do so wherever they be need most , it would encourage develop world state to reduce expenditure in their own child welfare programme in the knowledge that the developed world would bail them out . finally , the granting of citizenship to foreign child would undermine the cap of immigration and punish those who have wait patiently for long stretch of time to be permit to enter the country , work legally and establish their own family . 
point : humanitarian crisis that lead to a surplus of unwanted or orphaned child can create a groundswell of sympathy which drive parent to wish to adopt internationally . in china , where the one child policy create unprecedented number of girl to adopt , 14 , 500 be adopt in 20051 . however , this number pal in comparison to the client who be wait in line hop to provide a home in an environment where girl be not value less than their male counterparts1 . furthermore , the effect of wartime also act a instigator for international attention , drive adoption to offset the barbarous effect of the conflict itself . as a report into the adoption of korean child note , 'orphans of the korean and vietnam war , especially child father by american soldier , be give special humanitarian attention'2 . without international adoption , the likelihood of such child escape a life in an institution be remote . 1 graff , e . j . the lie we love . foreign policy , december 2008 : 5 2 kim , w . j . international adoption : a case review of korean child . child psychiatry and human development , 1995 , p . 141 . 
counterpoint : humanitarian crisis which ostensibly drive well mean parent to adopt internationally be a myth . the actual supply of child be ultimately drive by demand and corruption ; a demand rise for adoption , so too do the price of the process a trafficker be draw to the money that can be make . as alexandra yuster , a senior advisor on child protection with unicef , note , 'it's not really true that there be large number of infant with no home who either will be in institution or who need inter country adoption'1 . the attention of those in the developing world should not be to adopt these child , but to encourage the state in which they live to invest in child welfare program or to initiate aid program to provide it for them . the proliferation of international adoption serf little other than the greed of trafficker and adoption agency cash in on inflated statistic of orphan well be . 1 graff , e . j . the lie we love . foreign policy , december 2008 5 
point : many parent who desperately want child do not fit the socio economic requirement to adopt in their own country . western adoption law be very difficult to pass through ; even though anyone fertile can have naturally bear child . those look to adopt have to face stringent scrutiny . for example those make less than or equal to 20 , 000 u . s . d annually have difficulty adopt a they qualify a living below poverty level in the u . s whereas in third fourth world country that same amount qualifies a a decent income1 . furthermore , mother allow others to adopt their child be far more likely to pick young couple than old couple who have outlast their body clock in the search for a child2 . therefore , whilst your local government would argue you have insufficient resource to adopt , you be still able to provide for a child a more comfortable environment than that of an orphanage in his home country . 1 clark , s . , income requirements for domestic adoption . ehow 2 february 2011 : 6 2 jacobson , c . , ethnicity . contemporary sociology , 2009 , pp . 425 426 . 
counterpoint : international adoption law be loose than many domestic requirement , particularly in the western world , however this be not an argument in favour of international adoption . domestic requirement be stringent in order for adopted child to be protect from further stress and heartache . loose international law do not protect the child but favour parent whom often do not meet domestic criterion and therefore be potentially a risk , not necessarily to physically harm the child but not to adequately protect and look after them . if adoption be about ensure that the welfare of the child be always prioritize , couple should avoid international adoption program that clearly do not put the child's interest first . domestic program , with strict criterion , may not permit all couple to adopt ; such a response should be reluctantly accept , not circumvent through international adoption .
