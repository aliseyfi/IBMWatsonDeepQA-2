point : the violence that occur in the darfur region of western sudan since 2003 , approach genocide proportion with the death toll estimate between 300 , 000 and 500 , 000 out of a population of a little over a million and a half . 
counterpoint : the event in darfur be first and foremost a civil war , even if their consequence include a major humanitarian crisis . 
point : perhaps as damaging a the humanitarian consequence of the failure to intervene be the message it send to other leader consider solve their political and ethnic problem in a similar manner to khartoum . 
counterpoint : an ineffective message in this case might well have be bad than no message . had the west attempt to intervene , either by set up a no fly zone or even send in ground troop , and the killing not stop , it would have send a message that western threat and western power be a paper tiger . 
point : the sudanese government s unsavoury behaviour go beyond it action in darfur . its campaign against the southern rebel be replete with atrocity , and it have a long history of support terrorism include host osama bin ladin in the early 1990s . 1 
counterpoint : past experience in iraq and afghanistan indicate that terrorism tend to flourish when state be weak . an invasion of sudan , especially if it have lead to a collapse of the sudanese state , would have create a vacuum terrorist could kill , especially when the very invasion would provide the resentment and motivation for thousand of jihadi volunteer to fight the western crusader 
point : sudan s internal problem actively destabilize the entire region . more than a million refugee flee darfur , many travel to refugee camp in chad and southern sudan . this in turn have place stress on local resource . 1 
counterpoint : there be and continue to be a compelling case for a humanitarian response to the crisis , but this do not suggest that military intervention would have solve the situation . 
point : the conflict in sudan take on racial overtone . the inhabitant of darfur be largely black , the government force of arab descent . much of their treatment , include kidnapping and slavery , be a legacy of century of racist mistreatment and conflict between white and dark muslims . 1 
counterpoint : the sudanese government have long be integrate , and black sudanese as well a arabs serve in the cabinet and army . the rebellion in darfur be primarily political and be launch by former supporter of the government . there be no clear evidence it be base on race .
