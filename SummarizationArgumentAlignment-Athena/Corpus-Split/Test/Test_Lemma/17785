point : the ethic of private healthcare be not in question here ; indeed , the uk government have state that as many people a possible should be encourage to pay for private healthcare in order to relieve the strain on national resource 1 . critics have understand this a the government prolong wait list until the patient remove themselves either by go private , or die 2 . there be , however , a general understanding that the nhs in the uk be overburden and that increase private healthcare would help to balance this 3 . meanwhile , in the us , private healthcare be the norm 4 . allowing the sale of organ be merely an extension of this principle and provide utilitarian benefit . not only would those who be able to pay for an organ enjoy a much good chance at recovery , but there would be more time , space , and resource for the people who could not afford to do this privately . 
counterpoint : if payment for organ be introduce a a general norm , this will extend to the state finance hospital which be so burden in the first place . few family would turn down the opportunity to receive compensation or payment for the family of their love one which could ensure financial stability , particularly if the family member who die be the sole or main earner . therefore , either these family will charge the hospital the same price , or they will refuse to donate the organ , and turn to a private market instead . given that the black market price for organ can reach ten of thousand of pound 1 , it seem unlikely that struggle health system would be able to afford it , and this would only encourage an incredibly harmful disparity between the wealthy and the poor . unless the proposition case want to argue that a rich person inherently have a great right to an organ than a poor person , their point fall . 
point : legalisation can help to eliminate the corruption currently associate with the organ market . it can also make it easy to regulate , and so safe . given the mystery of the black market , medical complication be much more likely ; it be necessary to match the donor and recipient together 1 , but this cannot be easily do when every step of the organ collection and donation must be hide for fear of prosecution . legalisation could also stop the theft or organ and abuse of people like chinese prisoner 2 who be currently exploit for their organ 3 authority will become accountable to a publicly recognise and enforced system . 
counterpoint : if certain people be already risk punishment by harvest and transplant organ illegally , it seem unlikely that they will suddenly become accountable to a system that recognise that organ can be buy and sell arbitrarily . if chinese official be already suspect of these activity , it would be very difficult to ensure that profit from the donated organ do go to the donor or their family rather than corrupt authority . finally , legalize an action that be currently carry out in appal condition essentially legitimize appal human right violation , and allow human sacrifice . 
point : the proposition be not concern with live people try to donate their heart , or other vital organ which they cannot live without . no matter how impoverish that person might be , they will not choose certain death for a cash payoff . however , organ like kidney , and section of liver , can be and often be donate from a live donor without significant lasting damage 1 2 . it be patronise to forbid an individual to sell or donate an organ when it be possible for them to live without it . similarly , the family of a deceased relative , a next of kin , should have the right to receive financial remuneration from their organ . 
counterpoint : the state often deny individual the right to do certain thing with their body . for example , the state make hard drug illegal 1 2 because it recognize that sometimes individual do not make the best decision for their health or lifestyle choice , and that the physical damage to their body be often lasting and life change in way which that individual do not apprehend . furthermore , somebody who be sell an organ to try and pay off debt or to relieve financial pressure be unlikely to be think entirely rationally ; this be an incredibly extreme measure , and allow individual to take control over it for a cash reward be a dangerous way to create an incentive to cause bodily harm . 
point : given that the doctor , nurse and surgeon who work around organ transplant be all pay , it be nonsensical that the donor , the most important figure in the organ transplant , should be leave out . the united states already allow market for sperm 1 , blood 2 , human egg 3 and surrogate womb 4 . there be no good reason why organ should be exclude when these other human product be not ; there be no moral difference between a kidney and an ovum . moreover , organ donation be a lifesaving process , whereas sperm and egg donation be not . simply put , incentivizing donation through payment will save the life of many patient in need . the payment from these organ could also hugely improve the quality of life of the donor by lift them out of debt , or allow struggle individual , such a student , to improve their career potential by pay for their university fee . 
counterpoint : it be exactly because organ be potentially life save that it would be dangerous to legalize their sale . sperm and egg donation be a last resort for a couple struggle with infertility 1 2 3 ; they have have time to weigh their option . similarly , when sperm , blood or egg be donate , they regenerate kidney do not . when an organ be the only and final chance for the patient s recovery , the patient lose rationality and become desperate to obtain one 4 to the point where the donor can essentially name any exploitative price he or she like . not only be these individual then exploit , and the poorer patient leave to die , but hospital will be unable to afford them so the overall chance of a patient receive an organ will plummet for the majority without the money to pay for it .
