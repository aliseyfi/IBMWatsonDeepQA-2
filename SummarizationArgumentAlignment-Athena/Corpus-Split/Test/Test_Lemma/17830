point : the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shout fire in a theatre and cause a panic . 1 shouting fire in a crowded cinema when there be no fire , and you know it , be wrong because do so create a clear and present danger of harm to others . 
counterpoint : the argument lead to a slippery slope . it be one thing to regulate speech on matter that be objectively verifiable , quite another to restrict the permissible scope of opinion and expression . even then , the state should be extremely cautious about declare a state of objective fact . people take advice on matter such a tax always take the risk that that advice may turn out to be bad , the amount of risk a person be willing to take be entirely a matter of personal responsibility and not a matter that the government should intervene in . 
point : we need to protect minor those under the age of majority from exposure to obscene , offensive or potentially damaging material . while this would be a restriction on the freedom of speech it should be something that the government be responsible for and we would all agree need some kind of restriction or regulation . 
counterpoint : arguments that invoke censorship of material for minor be just that argument for the censorship of material for minor . they do not concede the general principal that censorship be good because until the age of majority the state have a duty to respect and to take limited measure to ensure others respect the parental responsibility of those bring up child . 
point : the government must protect it citizen from foreign enemy and internal enemy thus freedom of speech can be acceptably curtail during time of war in order to prevent propaganda and spy which might undermine the national interest . this have happen in almost all state during time of war , during the second world war the united states even have a government department dedicate to it ; the office of censorship . 1 
counterpoint : the end do not justify the mean . the government may well wish to suppress publication of information that would be prejudicial to it success in the next election or it war campaign , but it s in the public interest to know about their dirty dealing or illegal activity . 
point : speech act lead to physical act . thus pornography , hate speech and political polemic be causally link to rape , hate crime , and insurrection . 
counterpoint : society be self regulating . the link between speech act and physical act be a false one people who commit hate crime be likely to have read hate speech , people who commit sex crime be likely to have watch pornography but not necessarily the other way around . viewers of pornography and reader of hate speech be therefore not incite to commit anything they otherwise would not do .
