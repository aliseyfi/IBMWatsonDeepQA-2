point : gambling can become a psychologically addictive behavior in some people . according to the emotional neuroscience centre in massachusetts , monetary reward in a gambling like experiment produce brain activation very similar to that observe in a cocaine addict receive an infusion of cocaine . 1 because of this addictive nature , many people end up gamble to try to recover money they have already lose . this be know a chasing loss . it result in people stake more and more money , most of which they will lose , and sink deep and deep into debt . people start to gamble without think that they will become addicted . once that happen , it be often too late . a gambling addiction , in addition to the long term effect it have , can result in financial ruin in a few short hour . 
counterpoint : unlike drug , gambling be not physically or metabolically addictive . most gambler be not addict , simply ordinary people who enjoy the excitement of a bet on a sporting event or card game . only a small percentage of gambler have an addiction . many more get enjoyment from gamble without problem . the risk of gamble addiction be well know . people can make a conscious choice to start gambling , and be aware of the risk of addiction . 
point : gambling can have a devastating effect on family . the most obvious effect be financial a one partner use all their money on gamble the other need to support the whole family or the gambler may even gamble away joint saving . psychologically there be a relationship between gamble and various psychiatric and alcohol disorder . this be also an impact on friend , who do not want to be tie into support gamble financially or even just emotionally . lesieur and custer estimate that for each problem gambler there be 10 15 other people adversely impact by the gambling of that person . 1 as with drug , it be harmful to the individual concern and their family and friend , and it be well to ban gamble to stop people get start in the first place . 
counterpoint : treatment program can address the problem of those who be addict , and many casino offer self exclusion programs , where individual can effectively ban themselves from casino . this could be the initiative of either the gambler or their family or friend . 
point : someone can become addicted very easily they don t even need to leave their home , and online gambling site be available at all hour . this also mean that they be gamble in private . they may therefore be less reluctant to wager very large sum they cannot afford . in the united states in 1999 the national gambling impact study state the high speed instant gratification of internet game and the high level of privacy they offer may exacerbate problem and pathological gambling , 1 and it be estimate that 75 of internet gambler be problem gambler , compare with 20 of those who visit casino . 
counterpoint : internet gambling be in fact less dangerous than normal gambling . it be free from the pressure to gamble that casino can create through free food and entertainment , glitzy surroundings and peer pressure . and a child can t get credit card , they should not be able to gamble online anyway . stolen credit card can be use to commit fraud in any number of way online gamble be not a specific problem here . it be also in the interest of internet gamble site to run a trustworthy , responsible business . whatever they be look for online , internet user choose trusted brand that have be around for a while . if a gambling site act badly , for example by change it odds unfairly , word will soon get around and no one will want to use it . 
point : casinos be often associate with crime , particularly organize crime . when it come to local crime a study have find that only larceny theft liquor violation increase significantly with a small increase in prostitution . 1 but compare statistic probably do not show the real harm ; drug dealer and prostitute operate near casino they know that there be a large number of potential client in the area . moreover when a gambler be in debt and wish to continue gamble due to it addictive nature , he or she often turn to loan shark a no bank would lend to them . casinos can therefore be devastate to neighborhood . it would of course be wrong to assume all gambler be criminal , although there be an increased possibility that gambler in debt could turn to criminality through illegal borrowing . these loan shark themselves usually have link to organize crime , in some case be actually run by organize crime , 2 and use brutal method to reclaim their money . by ban gamble the opportunity for loan shark to offer their service be greatly reduce due to a less amount of gambler in debt , a be the opportunity for prostitute therefore reduce criminal activity in the area surround casino . 
counterpoint : people commit crime should be prosecute . the existence of criminal do not make nearby business include casinos immoral . it be perverse to punish people who just want to gamble and not take drug or use prostitute by take away their chance to do so . 
point : poor people be more likely to gamble , in the hope of get rich . in 1999 , the national gambling impact commission in the united states find that 80 percent of gamble revenue come from low income households1 . it be immoral for the state or charity to raise money by exploit people s stupidity and greed . taxing gambling be a regressive tax this mean that the poor pay a great proportion of their income in tax than the rich , and regressive taxation be deeply unfair . gambling attracts people with little money who be desperate for a windfall . these be the people who can least afford to lose money . 
counterpoint : gambling effect every person in the same way , everyone have the free will to decide to gamble and each may win or lose despite of their wealth or position in society , thus gamble cannot affect poor people to a great extent . gambling be only regressive because more poor people choose to gamble . 
point : gambling make people concentrate of win money . religious leader of all denomination see gamble a erode family values1 because it imply that material good should be value above other thing like friendship and family . it also send out the message that success should not necessarily be the result of merit and effort . as a philosophy , gamble culture be incredibly dangerous . those in society who most need to self improve , never do . instead , they tie their hope and dream to the lottery . there may be the possibility of win a big prize , but the overwhelming likelihood be that a gambler will lose money . instead , government should be promote value like thrift , hard work and self reliance rather than encourage or even allow gamble to promote it own negative value . 
counterpoint : there be no evidence that gamble make people not care about others . people do not gamble because they expect to win lot of money . most gamble a a form of entertainment . also , there be many area of life where success be not the result of merit or hard work . someone bear to well off parent may get many advantage in life without merit or hard work . there be therefore no ground for think that gamble promotes these undesirable value . the desire for wealth one that stem from society a a whole , not casino .
