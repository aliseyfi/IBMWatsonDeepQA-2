point : whatever the good intention of zoo keeper , animal in zoo suffer . they be inevitably confine in unnaturally small space , and be keep from the public by cage and bar . a study of british zoo find that elephant enclosure be 1000 time small than their natural habitats1 . wild polar bear be confine 'in space that be more than a million time small than their arctic territory . '1 they suffer psychological distress , often display by abnormal or self destructive behaviour . aquatic animal do not have enough water , bird be prevent from fly away by have their wing clip and be keep in aviary . furthermore , the location of zoo in urban area lead to incident like the fox attack at london zoo in 2010 that kill 11 south african and rockhopper penguins2 . 1 greenmuze staff . 2008 , september 12 . wild animals in captivity by rob laidlaw . retrieved june 1 , 2011 , from greenmuze : 1 2 hickman , m . 2010 , october 16 . penguins and flamingo fall prey to peckish fox . retrieved june 1 , 2011 , from the independent : 2 
counterpoint : wild animal do not suffer in well regulate , well run zoo . there have in the past be many bad zoo and cruel zookeepers . it be imperative that these be reform and weed out . the animal welfare act , enact by the united states in 1970 , be a good example of a step that can be take to ensure all animal be treat appropriately and not misuse or harmed1 . good zoo in which animal be well feed and well look after in spacious surroundings be become the norm and should be encourage . zoos can exist without cruelty to animal , however , and so the fact that there be animal welfare problem with some zoo do not mean that all zoo should be shut down . 1 grech , k . s . 2004 . detailed discussion of the laws affecting zoos . retrieved june 1 , 2011 , from animal legal and historical center : 3 
point : adults and child visit zoo will be give the subliminal message that it be ok to use animal for our own end , however it impinge on their freedom or quality of life . therefore zoo will encourage poor treatment of animal more generally . people do not go to zoos for educational reason they simply go to be entertain and divert by weird and wonderful creature see a object of beauty or entertainment . dale marcelini , a zoo curator in washington , conduct a study that find 'visitors spend less than 8 second per snake , and one minute per lion . '1otherwise , 'most people preoccupy themselves with eating , rest and shop people treat the exhibit like wallpaper 1 . as a form of education the zoo be deficient : the only way to understand an animal properly be to see it in it natural environment the zoo give a totally artificial and misleading view of the animal by isolate it from it ecosystem . 
counterpoint : zoos do not encourage the use of animal a mere entertainment . this argument assume that both the harm suffer by these animal be tremendous and the only value gain from zoo be human entertainment . however , the motif of the general public and the professional zoo keeper be not one and the same . zoo keep be a trained profession . animals in the zoo have regular access to good food and vet on standby should they fall ill . this be a far more luxurious lifestyle than they would have in their natural habitat . furthermore , within zoo animal have many benefit that wild animal be deprive of , from human understand to biological study . to see zoos a pure entertainment be myopic . 
point : states concern with the protection and welfare of wild animal be able to close zoo , release the animal back into their natural habitat and thereafter enforce immigration regulation that would ensure they any live cargo enter the country would be search and check . if find to contain wild animal , they could be send back to where they have arrive from and hopefully re place in their natural habitat . to cut supply would be inadvertently to reduce demand , and eventually ensure that the trade in live animal would cease , to the benefit of the wild animal population themselves . 
counterpoint : sending the trade underground be not the most effective mean to ensure the protection and conservation of wild animal . a general populace with previous first hand exposure to wild animal will not lose their appetite to them if zoos be close , foster a demand for a black market in the trade of live , wild animal . as such , the most effective mean to protect and conserve the population of wild animal be regulation of the zoo themselves , not restriction on their very entry to the state . furthermore , the release of previous captive animal into their 'natural' habitat be not advisable , they be not fit to survive in an environment where food be not provide and predator not keep separate . 
point : animals belong in their natural habitat , in the wild . it be a breach of their natural right to take them by force into captivity for our own purpose . they be 'prevented from gather their own food , develop their own social order and generally behave in way that be natural to them . '1 no matter how we may try to replicate their surrounding in a zoo , we will never achieve the full result . predators need to hunt and take from them their ability to do so by tame cage drug them be beyond cruel . a study by the journal science in 2008 find that 'asian elephant in european zoo have a median lifespan of just 18 . 9 year compare to 41 . 7 year for wild elephant in an asian logging camp . '2 excessive human involvement in the food cycle have disrupt it considerably . let nature take it course . 1 jamieson , d . 1985 . against zoos . retrieved june 1 , 2011 , from animal rights library : 4 2 berhaupt , n . a . 2011 , may 13 . zoos and animal in capitivity . retrieved june 1 , 2011 , from times union : 6 
counterpoint : the truth be that these claim be base around the logically skewed idea of animal right group . their argument have little or no factual basis merit for we cannot measure animal happiness . we cannot really say that they would be best leave in the wild . all we can do be review the information at hand . domesticated animal ; treat well , would you say they be unhappy ? well then how can we argue that take animal out of the wild be wrong ? we cannot . so rather than ban zoo , we should ensure that relevant safety measure be in place to ensure that these animal be as well looked after a possible . human being be part of the animal kingdom thus food cycle and our involvement be part of nature .
