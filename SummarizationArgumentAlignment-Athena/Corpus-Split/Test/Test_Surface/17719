Point:The debts of many developing countries were forced upon them at the time of, and often as a condition of, independence. Colonial powers thus placed extensive amounts of their own debt on the shoulders of their former territories. For example, the Netherlands forced Indonesia in 1949 to accept as a condition of independence the entirety of the colonial government's debt, itself the result of mercantilist exploitation by the mother country and the high cost of fighting the Indonesian rebels who struggled for independence for four years. France imposed a similarly high cost on Haiti in exchange for independence1. Forcing a new nation to effectively pay for the exploitation they suffered as well as for the soldiers and weapons that killed their own countrymen is manifestly unjust. Left with little wherewithal to pay, it is only right to cancel the debts owed by these countries. 1 Jubilee Debt Campaign. 2011. "Haiti". [3]
Counterpoint:In most cases there was no force in the assumption of debt by former colonies, and only a small part, if any, of the debt of most developing countries is the result of conditions meted out by colonialist states. In any case, it is necessary to consider the costs incurred by the colonizer, namely that they in many cases provided extensive security benefits to the colonies, brought education and Western-style infrastructure and institutions. It seems unreasonable to suggest they be barred from seeking a form of remuneration for these benefits provided. Furthermore, because of the fact that such a small part of the developing world's debt is a hangover from the colonial era, cancelling all of the debt makes no sense, and cancelling only the small part represented by that legacy would do little to relieve their overall debt burden. Cancelling developing world debt on this basis is thus unfounded.
Point:Cancelling debt and the interest payments these debts entail is the easiest way of helping the poorest countries develop. The cancellation of the debts would only apply to government to government debt and debts to the big international institutions such as the World Bank so there are relatively few actors who need to agree to the cancellation. As the cancellation would be done between governments it would be easy to target which countries get debt cancellation, this would mean the poorest and most in need but could potentially mean excluding countries where the windfall will simply mean propping up a regime that is brutalizing its own people. The IMF and World Bank could look at countries on a case by case basis to see which countries are most deserving and where the cancellation would have greatest benefits. The actual cancellation of the debts would then be relatively simple, the governments would simply accept that they are never going to be repaid and take the debt off their books.
Counterpoint:Cancelling debt it not the best way of helping the poorest, it simply results in giving mismanaged countries more money to waste. The poorest countries in the world are often the poorest either because of very high levels of economic mismanagement or through conflict. In neither case should we be helping those in charge of paying off the debt get off the hook. The money saved will not trickle down to the poorest that really need it. Instead extra money should be used as aid which can then be much better targeted.
Point:Because of the often insurmountable debt burdens laid on them, developing countries are forced to spend much of their economic resources on servicing the interest on their debt, rarely making much progress on reducing the principal, and thus locking themselves into a perpetual cycle of poverty1. For example, due to their debt burdens most African states pay four times as much on interest payments as they do on healthcare. Structural Readjustment Programs instituted by the IMF in some countries in order to reschedule debt payments have actually led to backsliding in quality of education, health, and welfare. Furthermore, developing countries often devote resources to production of "cash crops" for sale in the developed world rather than on food crops. The perverse incentives created by the need to pay off crushing debts has led many people in agriculturally fertile countries to starve. By cancelling debt, these countries have a chance to invest in their own future and devote resources to long-term development, rather than persistent debt repayment. 1: Jubilee Debt Campaign. 2008. "Expanded Debt Cancellation: A Key Tool to Fight Global Poverty". [6]
Counterpoint:Debt burden is far from the most serious cause of poverty and death in the developing world. Mismanagement by government, corruption, and war are rife in many countries without relation to debt burden. Irrespective of this, however, there is no moral ground for canceling debt just because it makes life better in these countries. It is the fault of the indebted state that it took loans it would find difficult to repay; it is a problem they have brought on themselves and does not absolve them from the responsibility of repayment. Also, the moral hazard created by canceling debt may teach developing countries the wrong lesson, encouraging them to take on further debts1. 1 Krugman, Paul. 2009. The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008. New York: W.W. Norton.
Point:Debts that are incurred by regimes for purposes other than the benefit of the country are called "odious debts". Such debts are held by many legal theorists, like Alexander Sack and Patricia Adams, to be ethically unenforceable. Expecting a government to pay back the debts accrued by a tyrant or dictator to finance their own self-enrichment is an unjust practice, as the people of the state, and the present regime, have not benefited fully, or at all, from the debts incurred in their name. Rather, as such tyrannical regimes made little distinction between the personal holdings of the dictator and those of the state, the debts accrued by him should be considered personal, not public debt. An example of the debt burden created by dictators is the case of Haiti, where Jean-Claude Duvalier, dictator from 1971 to 1986, pursued a policy of mass corruption and self-enrichment, taking on foreign loans to finance his own lavish lifestyle and the repression of the Haitian people. 40% of Haiti's current debt is the result of Duvalier's corruption1. To expect the democratic government of Haiti to pay for these excesses is entirely unjust and only compounds to the harms already inflicted by the dictatorship. Clearly, states that lend money to such tyrants cannot justly attempt to extract payment from successor regimes, considering that the loans they made often helped keep repressive dictators in power. 1 : Committee for the Abolition of Third World Debt. 2011. "Repay Historic Debts to Haiti". [7]
Counterpoint:Countries cannot be held accountable for doing business with dictators, especially when they are the only legitimate ruler of a territory. Investor states cannot be expected to hold back on their own essential investments abroad because of the nature of the government they have to deal with. There are many different kinds of government structures in the world; trying to assert that only one kind may have legitimate claims for repayment of debt made against them undermines the fabric of international relations and the acceptance of the world's multicultural and multi-institutional nature. Furthermore, acknowledging regime change as a legitimate ground for debt cancellation encourages instability in developing countries and promoting the risk of coups and revolutions. Groups will seek regime change in order to escape their debt burdens, leading to massive unrest and volatility. For these reasons, states, irrespective of government type or regime change, must be held liable for their debts.
