Point:Even if all subjects must show practical economic utility, the study of Classics is still justifiable. Translation of Latin and Ancient Greek teaches concentration, attention to detail and logical thought. Debates about the interpretation of classical literature develop the ability to think critically and to construct reasoned arguments. Familiarity with classical literature improves the ability to write clearly, concisely and eloquently. These are all skills valued by employers; people who have studied Classics have reached the top of politics, commerce, diplomacy and law.[1]
Counterpoint:All these skills can be learned through the study of other subjects, including oneâ€™s own language and other foreign languages. These subjects also have practical utility in themselves, unlike Latin and Ancient Greek. The prominence of people who have studied Classics in positions of power is a result of their social backgrounds or inherent intellectual abilities, not a classical education. Most people who have studied Classics attended either private schools (implying that they came from a privileged background) or schools intended for the academically gifted.
Point:Classics are useful for understanding the etymology (the study of the origins and development of words) of English words. Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian (the Romance languages) are derived from Latin: knowledge of Latin vocabulary greatly eases the learning of these languages.[1] Much modern language teaching emphasises conversational skills rather than grammatical rules; classical language teaching is usually based upon grammar, rather than conversation.[2] Pupils therefore develop a clear understanding of how languages work by studying classical languages; this can be applied to the study of both their own language and modern foreign languages.
Counterpoint:The study of etymology is of purely academic interest. It is more efficient to learn what words mean than to spend time learning a whole new language in order to be able to work out what words are likely to mean. It is also more efficient to learn modern foreign languages directly, rather than to learn Latin and/or Ancient Greek first. Once one has learned one foreign language, it is comparatively easy to learn another, since one has developed the techniques for learning vocabulary and grammatical structures. The similarities between the Romance languages mean that one can just as easily use knowledge of Italian to learn Spanish as one can use knowledge of Latin to learn either of these languages. Pupils should learn grammar when studying both their own language and modern foreign languages. It is absurd to suggest that they need to learn a dead language in order to do so.
Point:Learning classical languages gives pleasure to many who study them, since they are satisfying intellectual challenges. A substantial proportion of those who are given the opportunity to study Latin and/or Ancient Greek at school continue this study at university. Societies should not be obsessed with balance sheets and vocational skills, but should seek to provide cultural enrichment to their citizens. It is wrong that the opportunity for such cultural enrichment through classical languages if often only available to those whose parents can afford private education.
Counterpoint:While many people may gain intellectual pleasure from studying the classics, many others may find it difficult and unpleasant. It seems unfair then, that such a subject should be studied in school where it will most likely be examined upon, adding extra stress to students. People are able to research and study classics in their own time and it should not be imposed upon them in schools.
Point:The influence of classical texts upon subsequent writing and thought makes knowledge of Latin and Ancient Greek necessary for many areas of intellectual enquiry. European literature bristles with classical allusions: the work of Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe and countless others cannot be fully appreciated without close familiarity with the canon of classical writing.[1] Since Latin was the language of academic discussion until the eighteenth century, it is of great importance for the study of History and Theology. The teaching of classical languages at school enables people to pursue studies in these areas in later life.
Counterpoint:The small number of people who undertake advanced literary or historical work can learn classical languages at university or in later life if they are necessary for their studies. It is unnecessary for the vast majority of the population to read dead languages.
