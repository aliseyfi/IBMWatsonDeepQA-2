Point:Multilateral aid, particularly when delivered through NGOs or the UN, allows for the efficient pooling of financial resources. Much as when an individual makes a donation to a major charity, their small contribution goes much further when combined with those of many others. Particularly in the face of pressure to reduce foreign aid, America can still make a significant impact on development in other parts of the world through combining resources with other donors. By contrast, bilateral aid arrangements are often short-term and subject to change at short notice as a result of political or economic shifts in the donor country. Amidst growing fears of a U.S. debt default next week, for example, the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the House of Representatives has cut bilateral economic and development assistance to the rest of the developing world by an average of around 25 percent.1 Multilateral aid programmes are therefore more stable and can plan more usefully for the long-term.
Counterpoint:Multilateral aid through NGOs or UN agencies is less cost-efficient. Direct aid means that that aid is immediately reaching its destination and can begin working for the recipient government. When funds go to multilateral aid organizations, some of these funds will be spent by the agency itself for administrative purposes. Those funds which reach the field are often seriously delayed. GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations), for instance, has been shown to lack price transparency and cost-effective purchasing for the money it is donating.1 Moreover, when NGOs are used, the potential for abuse of resources exists, meaning less of the funds actually reach their intended destination. The UN, in particular, has a bad record of financial inefficiency.
Point:Multilateral aid tends to be less tied to the political self-interest of individual donor countries. One criticism of bilateral aid arrangements is that they are often drawn up based on self-interest. Major powers who provide international aid have tended to direct their aid to former colonies or countries with which they have significant strategic ties, economic interests or potential markets. Often, aid money must be spent on goods or services from the donor country. While the United States does not have as developed a colonial history as some other major donor states, it does have a history of providing aid to countries it sees as strategic partners. This was particularly true during the Cold War, but has now emerged as a practice in the war on terror. Aid that is given multilaterally is therefore much more likely to go to developing countries on the basis of need, and of where it has the most potential for good.
Counterpoint:Providers of aid, for the very reason that they are spending their own money, should have their interests served by an aid arrangement. Significant opposition exists to foreign aid in the United States. For this reason, it is important to demonstrate to the American public that their tax dollars are being spent in a way that benefits the nation and/or is used responsibly by the recipient nation. Sadly, many aid dollars have been wasted on countries with corrupt regimes that have misused the funds, or the recipients have lacked the resources internally to use the funds productively. The World Bank's strategy in Africa, for example, has downplayed underlying structural oppressions in which they are complicit, including corrupt power relations.1 This misuse is more likely to happen if aid is channelled through, and supervised by unaccountable international bureaucracies instead of given direct to countries in need.
Point:Multilateral aid arrangements tend to avoid unnecessarily coercive conditions. One of the strongest criticisms of bilateral aid is the tendency for donor countries to place strict political, diplomatic or economic conditions on the receipt of that aid. For example, the United States greeted Pakistan's cooperation with the war on terror with a generous economic and military aid package, worth more than $18.7 billion between 2002 and 2010,1 despite years of sanctions previously. Countries receiving development loans have often faced requirements for changes in internal policies on a range of issues not always directly tied to the aid itself.
Counterpoint:Multilateral aid has the potential to be equally or more coercive than bilateral aid arrangements. The history of World Bank and International Monetary Fund austerity programs and structural adjustment policies in the developing world has amply demonstrated that sometimes multilateral organizations can impose potent and harmful conditions on recipients, interfering with the internal affairs of other nations and doing long-lasting harm. These agencies have also been heavily criticized for their focus on economic concerns at the expense of more basic human needs, such as health, education and the alleviation of poverty.
