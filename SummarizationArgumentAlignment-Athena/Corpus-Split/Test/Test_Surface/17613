Point:New technologies have broken down traditional social relationships which provide stability and are important for psychological health. Many individuals are increasingly becoming self-absorbed in videogames and autonomous lives on the internet without making lasting connections with people face-to-face 1.Technology is not necessary for a fulfilling life, as the Amish show by avoiding technology which damages the community and harms social relations. 2
Counterpoint:Traditional social relationships are not necessarily good things. Often, such as with the family, they were arbitrary based on the location that someone lived or how they grew up. The internet allows people to form relationships which they can choose to fit their personalities and preferences. Thus, technology is not inherently harmful to socialisation. The Amish do not reject technology per se, they just regulate what they use in order to ensure a healthy society. It is just their preferences differ from “mainstream” society.
Point:Science has moved into new areas which violate the boundaries of morality. Research into cloning of persons and animals is taking place, as well as work on genetic manipulation.1 Such work is reckless and involves taking the position of God as an entity which decides what forms of life to create. Genetic testing involves the abuse of animals, which are used merely as tools in studies to increase knowledge.2
Counterpoint:The state should not preference individual belief systems above others and dictate morality accordingly, thus the idea of “God” is irrelevant given significant numbers of people do not believe in this as a basis of morality.
Point:Technology allows governments and those in authority to develop more powerful means to monitor citizens and control discussion. The totalitarian governments of the twentieth century (such as Stalinist Russia) utilised modern technology to monitor and indoctrinate populations.1 Even in democracies, monitoring of communications and centralisation of information makes it much more difficult for an individual to oppose actions they do not consider moral as any attempts to organise against it could mean arrest. 2It is no longer the case that citizens can chose to “opt-out” of control by a higher body by withdrawal to less controlled areas, such as the countryside.
Counterpoint:The proposition has not considered that technology can also empower individuals. Modern communications allow citizens to organise together to combat centralised control. The use of social networking for the modern movement of “flashmobs” and the 2011 riots in the United Kingdom illustrate this.1 The internet allows citizens’ access to vast amounts of data previously only available to powerful and connected, allowing more informed decision making.
Point:Advances in technology have increased the destructive capacity of conflict by enabling killing to occur much more rapidly, as can be seen by the destruction of the First and Second World Wars with their unprecedented number of deaths.1More “advanced” societies, or rather those with more destructive technology have been able to subjugate and oppress other societies with different value structures, such as Native Americans, Aborigines and all other colonised peoples.2 The development of Weapons of Mass Destruction has raised the threat of total global destruction.3 Science has produced the means for more suffering in an almost infinite capacity, which surely outweighs the benefits towards healing the sick.
Counterpoint:The proposition ignores the capacity of science to protect humanity, by allowing it to bypass natural phenomena and survive. The ability of humans to colonise other worlds in the future could be a useful means to avoid a natural disaster (such as the impact of meteors on earth).
Point:The pursuit of industrialisation and the use of modern technology require the generating of enormous amounts of energy. Such production creates severe damage to the environment via pollution 1. Renewable energy is currently expensive and difficult to reliably produce2. Humanity is treating itself as more important than the billions of other life-forms on earth who have rights themselves. The damage to the environment also threatens to leave the earth uninhabitable, which would also harm humanity’s interests. 3
Counterpoint:Science responds to the desires of humans to research new areas. It is being used to address pollution and create sustainable fuel to ensure the survival of the planet. Moreover, the effect of development on animals should not be overstated. It is true that many animals have suffered, and whilst wanton cruelty is unacceptable, a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted. Animals have rights and preferences, but these are surely weaker than humans given their reduced capabilities 1. Development has raised millions of humans out of poverty and improved their lives. 2 Scientists are the very group of individuals at the forefront of preventing global warming, so to blame them for the misuse of their developments is ridiculous.3
