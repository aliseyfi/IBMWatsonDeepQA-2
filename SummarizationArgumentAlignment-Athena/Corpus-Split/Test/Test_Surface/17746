Point:Franglais has connotations of English and French conflict such as the Norman conquest and the Hundred Years’ War and is a mark of disrespect and impertinence towards the French.
Counterpoint:There is a need for a progression in attitudes. The past and political history should not impinge on our freedom to choose our own words in the modern day, particularly when those political divisions no longer exist. An example is that the English call a certain flower a sweet William, but the Scots name it a stinking Billy as a result of the king who oppressed the Scots in favour of the English. However, England and Scotland have been unified for some three hundred years. Scotland has not elected independence, although such a party exists. Therefore, the memory remains, reflected by and encased in this use of language, but the original emotion does not.
Point:How a people see the world is encased in the words they use to communicate with each other and the words they use to write songs, poems and stories about their people’s history and experiences. Culture is inseparable from language. For example, the ‘e’ on the end of a word that is silent in everyday speech becomes pronounced in French poetry and song when it figures on the end of a line, thus adding an extra syllable to that line, and so “femme” on the end of a line of poetry would not be pronounced “fam”, but “fam-mer”, and so an extra syllable results. This principal also helps to create more rhymes within the poetry and song. Therefore, in order to keep the French culture alive, we must too protect its home language from falling to the globally dominant language of English. This is why we need an increased awareness and presence of francophone art; higher quotas of Francophone songs on the radio and the same of Francophone programmes on television. These two examples demonstrate how the culture itself can be better protected when the language is better upheld.
Counterpoint:But these two nations DO have shared history and these Anglicisms in the French language are only a reflection on this. For example, the British call a particular brass instrument a French horn, but the French call it un cor anglais, in translation, an English horn. Certainly, how a people see the world is encased and reflected in the language they use, and their history and their relations with other nations is not separable from this vision of the world. Au contraire, it is integral to it. It is unlikely that historical events embedded so deep in memory that are reflected through language are likely to disappear just because certain words are deemed unacceptable by a certain body like Défense de la langue française.
Point:There are four levels of French language. In descending order of formality these are; Précieux (snobby, poetic), Soutenu (literary, written), Courant (public, administrative), Familier (informal language, non-standard popular terms), Argotique (very informal language, offensive if used in the wrong context or said to a stranger).[1] “the Middle Ages (ninth century – fifteenth century)…[saw] the emergence of a new standard language, replacing Latin.”[2] Since French - if not began, at least ‘grew up’- it has functioned with these four levels of formality. Franglais is not standard French, although many Franglais nouns (un post-it, un walkman) would be acceptable in a formal context, and its presence, uprising and prevalence threatens the use and survival of the more formal versions of the language.
Counterpoint:Quod semper (as it always was). French has previously relaxed the formality of its language and has always changed by absorbing foreign influences.
Point:The French often call the use of Franglais “Anglo snobberie” and those who use it as opposed to the standard version of their mother tongue “Anglo snobs”.
Counterpoint:Language is spontaneous; our choice of words is subconscious and word association is derived from the individual’s own experiences and vision of the world. No two people’s choice of words will ever be identical.
Point:The French language cannot realistically survive if is not upheld as a relevant and respected language in official contexts. It is a very emotive and sensitive issue for the French people. The EU was founded by a Frenchman, Robert Schuman, France and Germany were two of the five founding members, the Union was created to ally France with Germany and before Britain joined, the French vetoed Britain’s entry. Now, the French feel their part is Europe is becoming diluted by the use of English. By forcing them to accept the English language in the context of an EU meeting only opens the gate to making them accept the same rules as other nations; if their own language is silenced, so too is their voice of expression and opposition.
Counterpoint:English is a valid language in the European Union. If M. Chirac, M. Sarkozy or any French leader wish to express him/herself in this language in order to improve diplomacy with their neighbours across the Channel, they have that very right.
