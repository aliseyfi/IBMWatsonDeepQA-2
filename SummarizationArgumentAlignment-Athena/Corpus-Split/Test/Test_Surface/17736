Point:Government intervention in the marketplace contradicts the values of free-trade advocated by western liberal democracies. The complexities of agricultural subsidies, price supports, regulations and protective tariffs means that farming in the US and the EU now has the air of a command economy. Coupled with highly liberal international trade markets and the relative ease of shipping foodstuffs around the world, subsidy schemes are increasingly subject to manipulation by farmers seeking to maximise the size of their support payments without engaging in additional productive activity. For example, “set-aside”[i] payments have been used by both European and American administrations to encourage farmers to leave a proportion of their fields fallow, in order to maintain the productivity and fertility of farming soil. However, many farmers have claimed set-aside payments by designating fertile land that is difficult or impossible cultivate (land on steep inclines, land obstructed by streams) as fallow fields.
Counterpoint:A subsidised farming industry is not protectionism rather it helps to create the most stable farming infrastructure possible. Agricultural commodities are subject to significant swings in price, due unpredictable changes in the weather, in pest activity and market volatility. Without government support to smooth the impact of market fluctuations, huge numbers of American farmers would be pushed into bankruptcy and forced off of their land and into penury. This would have knock on effects on economies throughout Europe and the United States, and would devastate many small rural communities.
Point:Subsidies cause poverty, both domestically and internationally. By maintaining the price of certain goods at a low level that does not reflect their market price, subsidies prevent farmers in the developing world from selling comparable goods to international customers for a comparable price. Despite higher labor costs wealthy western farmers are able to undercut their poorer counterparts in the developing world, with any shortfall in their incomes accounted for by their government subsidy.
Counterpoint:Neither the US nor the EU can be held responsible for international externalities caused by subsidy policies. If the US were to stop funding its farming industry, other developed nations would continue to engage in practices that would distort the international market. Indeed, the USA’s share of world food exports has been either flat or falling for almost 25 years, so it would be disproportionate to claim that the US is the primary cause of declining farm revenues in the developing world.
Point:Subsidies can contribute significantly to longer term ecological and environmental damage. By rendering the export of food so profitable, subsidies increase the use of air freight and rapid road haulage, increasing the emissions cost of trading produce.
Counterpoint:Food is a unique good, in the sense that it is essential for sustaining life, and plays a significant role in ensuring social stability and supporting the health and development of children. Governments should not gamble on an industry that supplies a commodity of such great importance by exposing farmers to the fluctuations and speculative impulses of the food markets. Nor should farmers and their crops be exposed the effects of sudden environmental change without some form of defence mechanism or insurance scheme being put in place.
