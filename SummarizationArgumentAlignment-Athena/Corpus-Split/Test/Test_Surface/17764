Point:The International Energy Agency (IEA) 2011 forecasts that global energy demand will increase by one-third from 2010 to 2035, and 90% of the increased demand will come from non-OECD countries like China and India (World Energy Outlook 2011 Factsheet, 2011). With the state of technology as it is, alternative technologies like solar power are insufficient to meet this demand. This means we will continue to use fossil fuels and will continue to increase carbon dioxide emissions – the IEA predicts a 20% increase of carbon dioxide emissions, causing a long-term increase in global average temperature, with catastrophic effects. If we can’t escape using fossil fuels, we should at least limit their emissions as much as possible, and CCS is a very effective means to that end.
Counterpoint:We shouldn’t be investing in the continued use of fossil fuels
Point:The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) finds that with current capture technologies, carbon dioxide emissions reaching the atmosphere from fossil fuels can be reduced by about 80 – 90% (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage, 2005). This leads the International Energy Agency to conclude that CCS is a key technology to stem carbon dioxide emissions that can be responsible for up to 18% of emission savings in a ‘safe’ scenario for climate change (World Energy Outlook 2011 Factsheet, 2011). This is because CCS can be fitted to existing power plants rather than requiring completely new plants to be built.
Counterpoint:CCS is too expensive to be cost-efficient
Point:Currently, there are many projects around the world demonstrating the feasibility of CCS. One well-known example is the Sleipner-project in Norway. This site has been in operation since 1996. Another example is the Weyburn-Midale project in Canada, which has stored over 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since October 2000. (Interactive Map, Global CCS Institute, 2011)
Counterpoint:CCS can’t scale up in time to be effective
