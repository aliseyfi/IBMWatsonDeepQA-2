Point:The effects of a general ban on the public display of the Confederate flag would reach beyond those whom it is so plainly meant to intimidate. It would remove what amounts to a constant visual reinforcement of Old Southern racial doctrines and would consequently help to cultivate a more tolerant society. Empirical studies indicate that "exposure to the Confederate ?ag led White participants to rate a hypothetical Black male character more negatively than those in the control condition. Participants' racial attitudes failed to predict the degree to which ?ag exposure produced more negative evaluations. These ?ndings support the argument that exposure to the Confederate ?ag activates racially biased responding, by virtue of the ?ag's cultural associations with prejudice, and results in negatively biased judgments of Black people"1.
Counterpoint:Censoring an ideology merely heightens the resentment felt by its adherents. Banning the Confederate flag would do nothing to eradicate the root causes of racial prejudice, and would in fact be far more likely to exacerbate feelings of intolerance. Censorship of even the most vile rhetoric, however appealing a prospect, "does not work because the repressed subject inevitably returns with more force just to spite the censor: it is hard to imagine a bigger boon to racism in America than an effort to ban private display of the Confederate battle flag."1 Indeed, such proscription often serves only to reinforce "paternalistic stereotypes about members of minority groups, suggesting that they need special protection from offensive speech."2
Point:Because the Confederate flag is almost invariably flown in communities affected by some degree of racial discord, its potency as a symbol of nostalgia for the racial hierarchy of the Old South is heightened. Were it to be flown in communities which enjoyed a pronounced racial harmony, the flag would be less likely to incite acts of hatred. However, when adjudicating the question of whether to allow such a display, "the value of such expression should be balanced against the likelihood that it will cause harm. The risks are greater when hate propaganda incorporates symbolism…that demagogues have historically displayed to rally supporters to action… [states must use] historical records to identify symbolism that is likely to terrorize the populace and, therefore, detract from the common good”1.
Counterpoint:Such scenarios lend a connotation of bigotry to almost any act. In communities affected by racial disharmony, almost any symbol has the potential to take on a cultural significance effectively identical to that of the Confederate flag. It is not as though the flag was conceived as a means of demonstrating intolerance, or is primarily used as such today. Those who fly the Confederate colors do so merely as a means of expressing pride in their heritage. If that is an act of bigotry, then practically any tradition or icon which relates to the Old South must be treated likewise. Indeed, "just as one can show an association between a symbol and racism, one could show a dissociation has occurred...a racist symbol could conceivably be 'cleansed' of its racist quality by becoming commonplace, in much the same way prayers before legislative sessions have become ceremonial"1.
Point:Insofar as the Confederate flag is representative of a social order in which people of color are of comparable status to property, its display creates an untenable atmosphere of racial intolerance. Though the First Amendment is explicit in guaranteeing the right to free expression, hate speech which serves to promote violence towards a particular group or individual is acknowledged to fall outside the boundaries of Constitutional protection. Any interpretation which would seek to narrow the definition of hate speech to only encompass direct exhortations to violence "fails to acknowledge that White supremacists' racist ideology blames racial and ethnic minorities for all of society's ills. When demagogues and leaders of hate groups use racist and hateful propaganda, they are seeking followers whose attachment to the organization is premised on seeing members of outgroups as less than human. Once minorities are assumed to be subhuman, there is no longer any reason not to eliminate them by attacking them physically"1.
Counterpoint:Bigoted rhetoric should only be limited when it constitutes an immediate incitement to violence. Displaying the Confederate flag is an expressive act which contains numerous and varied meanings. Though it is plainly true that many associate the flag with notions of white supremacy, it could only be taken as an exhortation to violence in the most indirect sense. As noted in the 1969 Supreme Court case Brandenburg v. Ohio, "the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy ...except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action". If such an inconsequential gesture as this is to be considered an act of incitement, then any number of seemingly innocuous speech acts must also lose their First Amendment protection, so long as they hold the bare potential to inspire violent sentiments in their audience. Indeed, as decided in the 1961 case Noto v. United States, even "the teaching of the moral propriety or... moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action".
Point:The right to free speech is an instrumental, rather than an intrinsic good. It does not derive its value from some abstract notion of expression for expression's own sake, but from the manner in which our First Amendment rights enable us to communicate our ideas to others in both private and public discourse. The Confederate flag possesses little, if any purpose save for the inflammation of lingering racial tensions. Furthermore, any sentiment which one could conceivably seek to express using the Confederate flag could be articulated in a much more constructive fashion through other means. There exist, as argued in the 1942 Supreme Court decision Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, "certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem... It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality". To display the Confederate flag is no invitation to dialogue, but rather an act of intimidation this is not something the government should be endorsing by allowing the flag to be flown on public property.
Counterpoint:Communicative value is an incredibly subjective criterion by which to determine the legal status of a speech act. Regardless of whether one perceives the Confederate flag to be a slap in the face to all those who remember the darker aspects of the Old South or a legitimate and innocuous means of expressing pride in one's heritage, its sanctity as a form of speech must be respected. Like any symbol, its communicative value is impossible to objectively judge, and is largely dependent on the viewer's own attitudes. Hence, to strip the flag of its Constitutional protections with the rationale that it is not a valid form of expression invites the closing of any number of other avenues of communication, particularly those which appeal to sentiment rather than rationality. Indeed, as explained in the 1971 Supreme Court decision Cohen v. California, "much linguistic expression serves a dual communicative function: it conveys not only ideas capable of relatively precise, detached explication, but otherwise inexpressible emotions as well... which, practically speaking, may often be the more important element of the overall message sought to be communicated."
