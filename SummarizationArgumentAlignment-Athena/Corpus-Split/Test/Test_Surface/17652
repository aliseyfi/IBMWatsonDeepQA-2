Point:The concept of parenthood in the context of donor-assisted conception is complicated. Is someone who donated an egg or some sperm really a parent? Shouldn't parent mean the one who cared for you as a baby, got up in the night for you, saw you through teething and childhood illnesses, and worked hard to give you food, shelter and the best life they were able to provide? In the case of children seeking the mother who gave them up for adoption, this is permissible specifically because of the relationship built up during pregnancy and birth1. In the case of sperm donors, 'whether for money or out of altruism, the father has gone into a cubicle and masturbated into a container. There is a difference'1. As such, given that donors never actually meet or speak to the real parents or the actual children, the situation is not at all like adoption or even surrogacy. It is more like blood donation, and therefore gives the recipient no rights over the donor.1 Berlins, M. (2006, April 5). Children's right to find their sperm donor father. Retrieved July 6, 2011, from The Guardian [1]
Counterpoint:Sperm and egg donors are biological, and therefore the only objectively true, parents. Therefore, they have to accept that a child conceived using their material assumes 50% of their DNA, and inevitably thereafter will be linked to them. Donors who enter into the process must therefore accept that children are naturally going to be curious about where half of themselves originated. As Olivia Merricks, who used a sperm donor to have her daughter Zannah, argues, 'I think people should only be donors if they understand that need to know more about yourself'1. Nowhere else in the law are children denied the right to know who their parents are if the information is available. This reflects the widely-held, and very natural, notion that learning about yourself is one of the fundamental driving forces of life. We ask our parents questions not just to know about their lives, but to understand how we came to be. It is to our parents that we direct such questions specifically because we share their genes. As such, donors cannot deny they are true parents.
Point:Few would-be sperm or egg donors wish to be known to any children resulting from their donation. Removing anonymity is therefore a major deterrent, especially as in most countries little money is paid for sperm donations (more is paid for eggs because the procedure is much more intrusive and unpleasant for a female donor). It was widely predicted that removing anonymity in the UK would result in a fall in donations, and this has in fact happened for both eggs and sperm – despite government claims that sperm donors have increased, the number of actual donations has crucially gone down. As the Times reports, the number of women treated with donated sperm fell by 20 per cent in the first year anonymity was lifted, reflecting the reduced number of sperm donations 1. Egg treatments are similarly down, by 40%, a ‘catastrophic drop’ according to a British Member of Parliament 1. If the donor name were to appear on the actual birth certificate of any child, it is obvious that even fewer people will be prepared to donate. Given the desperation of infertile couples seeking assistance with conception, and the long waiting lists for both eggs and sperm, the predictable consequence of this policy is both lamentable and cruel.
Counterpoint:Removing donor anonymity does not deter donor populations overall, but it does alter the composition of the donor population. Instead of young single men who do not have children, it tends to be older men, who do have children and who see that what they are doing is creating a family, who come forward'1. For example, in Sweden, where anonymity has been lifted, after an initial fall, the profile changed in just this manner1. Furthermore, the UK policy of removing anonymity has also not affected the number of sperm donors negatively. The numbers had fallen for three years leading up to 2005, when anonymity was lifted, but increased somewhat in the two years following, with a 6% rise in the number of donors2. The number of egg donors is down somewhat, but the reasons for this have much more to do with wider issues of publicity and incentives than with anonymity.1 BBC News. (2005, March 31).

Point:Because lifting anonymity makes it so much more difficult to conceive a child through the government's regulated health care system, desperate couples will be driven to look for alternatives. Estimates suggest that, in the UK where anonymity has been lifted, one in seven couples have fertility problems1. However, with long waits for donors expected after the policy change, many are increasingly turning to riskier, unregulated options. Women will be tempted to seek sperm informally from male friends (the Do-It-Yourself "turkey baster" approach), which can cause frictions among friendship groups. Couples will also go abroad as "fertility tourists", seeking eggs and sperm in countries where donors can still remain anonymous2. Such consequences are clearly bad for everyone, being unregulated, often emotionally messy, and possibly even dangerous. The evidence from Sweden also suggests that it is now much less likely that parents will be honest with their children about their origins, defeating the whole point of the policy3.1 BBC News.

Retrieved July 6, 2011, from The Times: [6]3 BBC News. (2004, January 18). Sperm donors 'to lose anonymity'. Retrieved July 6, 2011, from BBC News: [7]
Counterpoint:A reduction in the number of donors will not force couples overseas. Firstly, most couples will trust their own health system much more than foreign ones with fewer safeguards, so they won’t want to go abroad. Secondly, seeking a donor abroad is a much more expensive business; whilst a British donor is paid just £250 pounds ‘compensation’, a Spanish donor will receive up to €900. The extra cost is passed on to the donor-seeking couples 1. As such, most people are simply unable to go overseas, even if they felt they had a better chance of conception by doing so.
Point:Sperm and egg donors have a right to remain anonymous. Having gone out of their way to provide a means for a couple to have the child they otherwise could not have had, they deserve their wishes to be respected in return. The unveiling of their identity and, likely, contact from the child would cause psychological harm at least equal to that of the offspring1. There should be no hierarchy regarding whose rights are more important, disclosure should only be permitted if both parties are happy to do so. In the United States, for example, when signing up with donor banks, donors are able to 'make it clear' they don't want to be found by signing a waiver of anonymity2. If donors wish to sign that form and retain their privacy, that right should not be taken from them, regardless of the child's wishes. Donors should be entitled to move on with their lives and not fear being tracked by offspring they neither asked for, nor wanted3.1 Berlins, M. (2006, April 5).

Counterpoint:The right to privacy of a sperm or egg donor is less fundamental than that of the child's right to know, therefore the donor's desire for anonymity is overridden by the child's desire to know who their actual parents are1. To deny to a child the name of one of their parents, when it is available and on record, is to discriminate between children based on whether they were conceived naturally or not. Many parents, if given a choice, would choose to remain anonymous after one-night-stands, or accidental pregnancies, however since they are given no right to privacy, why is it that granted to donors? What is shared between both cases is the superiority of the child's rights and an understanding that regardless of the circumstances in which they were conceived, they deserve an equality of rights which remain paramount. One of those rights is the right to know who their biological parents are.1 The Economist. (2007, August 2). Misconceived. Retrieved July 6, 2011, from The Economist: [10]
