Point:States cannot expect to be held responsible for the actions of their fellow states where suspects are rendered to. The C.I.A. has a policy in practice where it obtains “diplomatic assurance” that torture will not be used. Under customary international law, the U.S.A. is obliged to act “in good faith”. So, when America is given diplomatic assurance by another government, it would be a diplomatic blunder and ill-advised not to trust that guarantee. Also, imagine the consequence if it were one day proved that the C.I.A. rendered a person, knowing they would be tortured: not only would the persons involved lose their jobs, but also the reputation of the C.I.A. would be severely damaged. That’s why the C.I.A. has an incentive to make sure that these assurances are believable and do their due diligence. If thereafter torture occurs, the state responsible for rendering the suspect is understandably innocent of any blame.
Counterpoint:States must do more than simply garner ‘diplomatic assurance’, a promise that is not worth the paper is written on. How, for example, does the U.S. Government know the difference between the “harsh interrogation methods” and “torture” of the state accepting the suspect, and on what grounds does it base its belief that it is “more likely than not” that torture won’t take place? The work of the C.I.A., by its nature, is secretive. So, even if the C.I.A. does research and obtains agreements, the general public can never check whether these agreements hold any water. Since the C.I.A. is being held responsible to fight terrorism, they might even have an incentive to bend the rules a bit – as long as they can later show results to the public.
Point:Extraordinary renditions save lives. It is used to bring people who are known or believed to be terrorists, to justice. These suspects are often stateless or hide in places where ordinary processes of law do not work – extraordinary rendition is then the only possible way of tracking them down, getting the necessary information from them, and bringing them to justice. They carry information which could save thousands of lives – the U.S.A. would be foolish not to try and get that out of them. An example of this is Ramzi Youssef, who masterminded the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and plotted to blow up airlines over the Pacific Ocean. After a rendition to the U.S.A., he was convicted and now serves a life-sentence.[1] Without rendition, who knows how many people he would have killed or how long he would have escaped the justice that he deserved.
Counterpoint:Extraordinary rendition harms civilians more than it protects them. For every example of an “effective” rendition, one has to ask: is it worth it? Because for every terrorist successfully caught and convicted after rendition, there may be many more mistakes. On top of that consider the loss of reputation that the practice of extraordinary rendition has caused the U.S.A. to suffer amongst its chief allies. In 2007 the E.U. adopted a report condemning this particular U.S. policy, and this was followed by a massive public outcry.[1] Such American tactics simply play into the hands of terrorists who seek to stir hatred against America and divide it from its allies. And finally: does the pretext of a terrorist threat really justify taking away a person’s basic human right to due process? Especially as many experts believe that torture is an ineffective method of acquiring reliable intelligence in any case.
Point:Certain states have made reservations to the general treaties which permit rendition under specific circumstances. For example, when ratifying the Convention Against Torture (CAT) in 1994, the U.S.A. made the reservation that it can render persons to countries when they believe that it is more likely than not that a person won’t be tortured – so, under the U.S. interpretation of CAT, the U.S.A. can render persons to countries that practice torture, as long as the U.S.A has reason to believe that it will not torture in this specific case.[1] This is a reasonable, and legal, means to circumvent the convention.
Counterpoint:Extraordinary rendition is never acceptable. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 state that ‘individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying power or to that of any other country, are prohibited, regardless of their motive’.[1] There is no room in international humanitarian law, which covers armed conflict, for the forced transfer of protected persons. Furthermore, whilst the US relies on the deniability of its rendition program, the fact that the most common destinations include Egypt, Syria and Jordan ensures that such claims can be dismissed as mere obfuscation.[2]
Point:Extraordinary rendition permits the transferring of suspected enemy combatants from one place to another without the bureaucratic and legal difficulties of establishing their legal position. Contemporary warfare, most notably suspected terrorists in the war on terror, are not covered by the dictates of international humanitarian law, requiring extraordinary rendition to move the suspects from battlefields to places of interrogation and then back to their countries of residence. As Condoleezza Rice argued “In some situations a terrorist suspect can be extradited according to traditional judicial procedures. But there have long been many other cases where, for some reason, the local government cannot detain or prosecute a suspect, and traditional extradition is not a good option.”[1] Without extraordinary rendition, the process or extradition would take much longer and suspects’ cases would remain tied up in military tribunals or civilian courts for indefinite amounts of time, sometimes rendition is the only practical option.
Counterpoint:The legal ambiguity of enemy combatants is a problem, but it is not one solved by the circumvention of international law. States must either grant current Geneva Convention dictates to enemy combatants, and disregard the awkward fit, or advocate for the evolution of international law to ensure combatants are granted their requisite rights. The circumvention enshrined in the practise of extraordinary rendition serves merely to convey that ignoring international law is acceptable, inadvertently justifying the illegal actions of enemy combatants who also flagrantly violate Geneva Convention protocols. To provide such a propaganda tool for enemy combatants is most certainly not necessary in contemporary warfare; it will only strengthen its barbarity and the ignorance of restraints built up to limit warfare.
