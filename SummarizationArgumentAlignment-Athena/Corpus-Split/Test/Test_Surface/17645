Point:There are several ways in which the government can make homes affordable. The most obvious is to encourage the building of cheap homes by ensuring that the newly built home can only be sold for a small profit over the cost of construction. At the moment developers prefer to build large houses or 'executive apartments' that are not affordable because they do not cost much more to build than cheap homes yet sell for a much higher price so there is more profits. Capping the amount of profit developers could make out of the biggest homes would change the incentives to it being better to build a lot of small cheap houses. In 2004 John Prescott, then Deputy Prime Minister of the UK, challenged the construction to build homes for £60,000. The construction cost was ultimately higher at £85,000 however they sold or over £200,000 because the developers could sell at the market price1.
Counterpoint:This would simply be giving the profit to the first buyer of the property. As such while it would help a very few first time buyers it would do little to reduce the overall market price of homes.
Point:Recently, Grant Shapps, the UK housing minister, headed a meeting at the Department for Communities and Local Government in order to persuade senior executives from Britain's biggest home builders, estate agents, and mortgage lenders to engineer "an age of aspiration," by helping more young people to buy their first homes.1 This soaring rhetoric implies the government's underlying worry that, due to the current unaffordability of homes, social mobility is becoming more difficult. Such high house prices and strict lending criteria make a young person's position in society dependent on the goodwill of affluent and generous parents to help them raise a deposit. This, of course, gives children born to a higher social class a lifetime advantage over peers from a poorer background. In a vicious cycle, richer children will grow up to own capital assets, including houses, which they will be able to pass on as inheritance to their offspring. It is an injustice that artificial barriers to entry, such as extortionate mortgages, prevent poorer young people from entering the housing market and leave them with nothing to show for a lifetime of paying rent.2
Counterpoint:A high house price is a just reward for property-owners' labour, it is therefore the product of social mobility. Existing homeowners have often worked hard to secure a job with a high wage and saved prudently in order to pay for a deposit on a house. Often, these people have worked hard to afford a house in order to provide a nest-egg for their children. It seems unfair that homeowners should be forced to leave a lesser inheritance to their heirs, by reducing house prices, making it harder for their own children to remain in the class to which they were born. Furthermore, in most countries, those who own valuable properties already pay higher taxation, some of which goes to programs to encourage social mobility; it seems unfair that people in this higher tax bracket should be hit twice.
Point:Before the financial crisis, housing prices were rising fast. Rather than stopping this trend, governments and financial institutions tried to adapt to and profit from it. To sustain soaring house prices, banks lent mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, through so-called "innovations," such as interest-only mortgages, 100% mortgages and lending to people with poor credit histories. A subsequent rise in mortgage defaults left banks less willing to lend money. So, as mortgages have become more expensive, many people have been priced out of the market.1 It is unfair that first, homes became so unaffordable because of bad decisions by banks and, that second, the same banks are now lending mortgages to buy-to-let landlords, who are buying up houses to rent out to young people who, otherwise, would have been first-time buyers. Therefore, banks should be forced to lend money to young people trying to enter into the property market.
Counterpoint:Banks' willingness to give mortgages to people who couldn't afford homes, and then to hide the risk, caused the recession. The mentality that homes should be affordable to people who can't buy them in the open market is exactly the mentality that allowed the US sub-prime market to bring down the economy. Relaxing financial legislation in an attempt to force banks to lend to first-time buyers will simply cause another recession. This is because lower house prices will leave many homeowners in negative equity as the reduction in house prices will result in banks being owed money, which the sale of the house cannot recover.1 As negative equity was a major cause of the country's economic downturn, it is imperative that house prices remain at their natural level—not artificially low.
Point:To buy a house in England, you need to earn £31,000 per year. If you wish to buy a house in London, you need to earn £50,000. These figures are much higher than the average income per person. In England the average annual wage is £20,000, whilst in London it is £26,000. This means that most young people will not be able to enter the housing market1. As house prices are high compared to income, most young people will not be able to buy a property unless they have a partner. This will force people into pragmatic—but artificial—relationships, and compel people to stay in these relationships for financial reasons, and this cannot be socially ideal.
Counterpoint:Instead of trying to manipulate housing prices, societies need to re-examine their views of the proper stage of life when it is necessary and advisable to purchase a house. There is no reason why friends cannot come together to sign mortgages together, such as the "Share to Buy" mortgages offered by Britannia, in order to move out of their parents' houses.1 It is simply sensible to wait to raise a family until parents are a little older, have two strong incomes and are in an economically stable position. In this way, prudence and good financial sense will continue along the family line, leading to a more economically stable society.
