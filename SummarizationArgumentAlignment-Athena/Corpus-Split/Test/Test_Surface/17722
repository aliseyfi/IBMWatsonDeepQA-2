Point:Global institutions are better equipped to comparatively analyze the facts about FGM and therefore need to prohibit the practice of FGM so that those ignorant to the consequences of the practice will be protected. Global organizations are also the only bodies that can ensure that marriage networks give up the practice simultaneously so that no woman is socially handicapped. This process proved successful in China in the early 20th century when the practice of foot binding was rapidly abandoned1. It requires sufficient funding for large scale education efforts and adequate enforcement, a financial requirement that only these large organizations can meet2.
Counterpoint:Making this a blanket policy coming from international organizations, and human rights treaties, will likely only create backlash against the invasion of Western culture. This has been seen in the past, where for example, in the Sudan the British and Egyptians forced the practice to be ended in the 1970s, which only forced it to happen in secret, girls were cut at an earlier age, and they were not taken to medical professionals if complications arose[1]. If there is a backlash, then a global ban coming from international organizations—for whom this project is also too specialized, and highly culturally sensitive—will fail completely.
Point:While many believe that FGM is associated with the tenets of a religion, this is in fact not the case. Different religious leaders condone, deem it irrelevant, or discourage it, but there is no one religion that explicitly says FGM is a necessary practice[1]. Therefore, banning FGM is not declaring a religion wrong and does not debunk the fundamental beliefs of a group of people. Instead, it is competing with a cultural practice that shows a woman’s purity, considered to be harmful to her. Cultures change and adapt as they come into modernity—foot binding is no longer practiced in China, although it was a deep seeded tradition. However, as long as it remains culturally valued for women to be ‘cut’ and men only want to marry ‘cut’ women the practice will continue[2]. Therefore, there needs to be a total ban on the practice so that all women are ‘uncut’ otherwise, not undergoing the procedure will continue to carry stigma in some societies. The practice has been replaced within some groups, with one that celebrates and serves the same purpose, but does not involve cutting[3]. FGM is not a necessary part of religion and the fundamental beliefs of the groups that practice it. So, it is not insensitive to ban it. And, a ban is the only way to make being ‘uncut’ the norm within these cultures.
Counterpoint:Whether it is tied to religion, does not justify calling a cultural tradition wrong. Conservative Jews believe that piercings, tattoos, and any other form of changing the body are wrong, yet it is accepted that they have the right to believe what they do. The most important factor is choice—people are allowed to choose what they do with their bodies and what they believe. Telling them this is wrong is not appropriate. This applies to genital cutting as well. Telling groups of people who have historically practiced cutting that this is inherently bad is not sensitive or justified. Education and safe practices should instead be promoted so that people can make educated decisions.
Point:Some rights are inalienable, guaranteed to all human beings and cannot be violated with any justification. The right to bodily integrity is perhaps the most fundamental right we enjoy as civilized human beings1. FGM is a form of illegal body modification and the mutilation of those too young to give their informed consent. Most are not given the choice as they would be socially marginalized if they were 'uncut'. Genital mutilation may leave a lasting mark on the life and mind of the woman who has undergone it. In the longer term, women may suffer feelings of incompleteness, anxiety and depression. FGM is also a form of violence against women and a direct expression of patriarchal oppression. FGM has been practiced by some cultures solely in order to maintain the chastity and virginity of a woman before marriage, to ensure fidelity during marriage, and to increase male sexual pleasure2. FGM additionally violates her right to equal opportunity, to not be discriminated against, to freedom from violence, injury, abuse, torture, cruel or inhuman treatment, protection from harmful traditional practices and the freedom to make reproductive decisions, all of which are protected under international law3. It takes a woman's body out of her own control, and ultimately inflicts long term pain and suffering, none of which can be justified.
Counterpoint:As a human right a woman has a right to control her own body and make her own choices. This only promotes the need for increased education and choice in regards to genital cutting, versus a total ban. If women choose that they would like to undergo the practice, then they should be allowed to, considering that denying them this option is also violating their right to free choice and bodily expression. FGM is primarily continued by women and often against the wishes of a growing majority of men, so it cannot simply be seen as "patriarchal oppression"1.
Point:Immediate complications of female genital mutilation include severe pain, shock, hemorrhage, urine retention, ulceration of the genital region and injury to adjacent tissue1. Hemorrhaging and infection can cause death. Long-term consequences include cysts and abscesses, keloid scar formation, damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) and sexual dysfunction, as well as difficulties with childbirth2. More recently, concern has arisen about possible transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) due to the use of a single instrument in multiple operations3. The fundamental goal of human society is preservation, and it is the responsibility of world-wide organizations to safeguard human sustainability. This goal is compromised in cultures that practice FGM. Deliveries to women who have undergone FGM are significantly more likely to be complicated by caesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, and episiotomy, extended maternal hospital stay, resuscitation of the infant, and inpatient prenatal death, than deliveries to women who have not had FGM. It was estimated in a June 2006 WHO study that 10 to 20 babies per thousand births die during delivery as a result of the practice of FGM4. Additionally 25-30% of women who undergo FGM are left infertile5. FGM jeopardizes maternal and infant health and therefore cannot be justified. The health consequences that it causes mean it should not be allowed to continue.
Counterpoint:Since genital cutting is culturally important, especially to preserving the idea of a woman's purity, virginity, and therefore her ability to get married, a ban on genital mutilation would only cause the practice to go underground1. Making the practice safe and regulated would better solve the health problems associated with it, versus banning it all together.
