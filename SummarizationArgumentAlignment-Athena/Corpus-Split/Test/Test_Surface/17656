Point:The primary justification for democracy promotion is the democratic peace theory. The theory of the democratic peace goes back to Immanuel Kant's essay 'Perpetual Peace', which he published in 17951; perpetual peace refers to a state of affairs where peace is permanently established over a certain area, as the Roman and British Empires attempted to do during their respective periods of dominance in history. Kant's theory was that the majority of people would never go to war, unless in self-defence2. Democracies tend not to go to war as often as other countries because their military is more directly under civilian control. Authoritarian governments or those heavily underpinned by their respective armies, by contrast, have no such barriers to whimsical invasions of other countries (nor the use of the national army to suppress their own people in a bid to solidify power). Communist North Korea is just one example of a country whose foreign policy is extremely aggressive as a direct result of its political inclinations3. Therefore if all countries were democracies there would be no wars as there would be no aggressors. Given the peaceful nature of democratic states, it is clearly in the interest of the USA to promote democratic change worldwide.
Counterpoint:The imposition of a foreign or alien political theory is often viewed in the recipient country as an unwarranted invasion, whether enforced militarily or not. The globalisation of Western culture is viewed by many as eroding traditional values and this often fosters resentment and can lead to widespread support of terrorism1. This does not have the effect of worldwide peace, and again a more indirect Western foreign policy may prevent strikes of retribution by disaffected traditionalists.
Point:Democracy is a universal value which knows no cultural boundaries. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status"1. It is a fallacy to suggest that we should excuse countries from this clause because their culture seems to preach otherwise. The principles of democracy are something that everyone is entitled to simply because they are right and fair. Democracy should not be reserved as a privilege for those who happen to be born in a culture that already supports it; we must endeavour to make all countries believe in the veracity of this declaration.
Counterpoint:Some theorists suggest that democracy is a unique method of governance which reflects uniquely western and European values. Afghanistan is a prime example of this1. The international community footed the bill for the 2009 presidential elections, worth hundreds of millions of dollars; however, according to the Afghanistan Independent Election Commission (IEC), only about one-third of registered voters visited the polls, approximately 5 million of the roughly 15 million Afghans who registered2. A 2010 national survey conducted by the Asia Foundation shows that when faced with social or economic problems, or in need of dispute resolution or services, the vast majority of Afghan respondents approach a non-government entity, either the village shura or jirga, or the malik or mullah3. Culturally a more unitary system of governance suits the needs of the country better; to force Western democratic values on other countries through expansive democracy promotion is ultimately to interfere with their right to self-determination and self-government.
Point:Democracy is good for the worldwide economy, as its values of openness and accountability promote the rule of law and good governance in the people's interest. The threat that the electorate will not re-elect them at the next election forces governments to adopt social and economic policies which will make their citizens richer and more secure. In practice this means creating open markets friendly to inward investment and eager for trade, while reining in corruption, military spending and aggressive foreign policies. China is a good example here. Of course it is by no means democratic, but in order to continue its economic boom it has over the last ten years had to open up its business practices to the world. Integration into the world economy (for example, joining the WTO) has led to greater transparency1. Because encouraging such policies is clearly in the economic interests of all current democracies, they should actively seek to promote democracy abroad as the best way to achieve wealth.
Counterpoint:The economic benefits of democracy are dubious, despite the attractiveness of the theoretical links between free elections and prosperity. Many would argue that the causation runs the other way, arguing that as an economy develops the rising middle-classes seek to protect their property and business investments by pushing for accountable government which will abide by the rule of law: thus democracy does not need to be promoted politically, it should emerge naturally from economic growth. See china again â€“ politics coming from economics, not the other way round. While integration into the global trading community might make countries less inclined to violence for fear of the economic damage they might do to themselves, there are plenty of examples of relatively prosperous countries using their wealth to fund military expansion and often war. Britain and Germany in the years before 1914 spring to mind here, as does Iraq in 1990. None of this suggests that democracies would be wise to prioritise democratization in its foreign policy.
Point:"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person"1, "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression"2 and "Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives"3 are three of the most fundamental tenets of democratic society. The vote ensures that public expression can take place peacefully, instead of violently. Free speech provides a legitimate avenue through which to address the government and ease tensions in society that could potentially turn violent. For these reasons, democracies tend not to suppress their people using violence, as in the case of the Tiananmen Square incident in Communist China4 or with the "Tulip Revolution" in authoritarian Kyrgystan5. In fact, democracies tend to have constitutions, which ensure the government cannot violently suppress peaceful dissent, and must always honour the beliefs of the majority of its people. Everyone should have a right to live without fear of suppression and with the ability to voice their opinions and beliefs. Because such values are written deep within the heart of the democracies, our governments should seek to export them wherever possible abroad. If Western democracies are to live up to their calling as "shining beacons" for all mankind, it should seek to promote democratization as the best means of improving human well-being around the world.
Counterpoint:Those who are against democracy promotion frame the discussion differently. While democracy does bring liberalization, this can provide a platform for extremist political or religious views which were suppressed under more authoritarian regimes. Also, imposing a democracy risks allowing leaders whose political campaigns are subsidised or supported by terrorists into power, as appears to have happened with Hamas in the Palestinian territories1. Consequently it is sometimes in the national interests of democracies to support regimes who share a commitment to the war against terror (e.g. Pakistan or Ethiopia), even if these are less than fully democratic, rather than running the risk of 'liberating' a country which may well turn on them.
