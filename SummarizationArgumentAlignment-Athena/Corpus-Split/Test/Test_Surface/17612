Point:A thousand years ago we would have been dead by the time we were forty. Now, it is considered strange for someone to die at that age. Setting aside religion, we will find that any decision, mark or setting, any limit or law - moral or legal - on when we should die, is always going to be wholly arbitrary.
Counterpoint:Just because we would have to make an arbitrary decision does not mean that it would be the wrong decision. There are thousands of arbitrary rules that govern our lives and yet we do not question them. The proposition argument is fallacious. Just because something is arbitrary does not mean it is wrong.
Point:Every species seeks to adapt, to enable itself to survive better. What would be a better way to improve the human species than to make us unable to die?
Counterpoint:This does not fit into a logical argument. Yes, every species does seek to adapt to suit its environment, but species do not seek immortality of the individual. They want their young to survive, and their young following that. This is entirely selfless. However, to seek immortality of the individual, or of the self: that is selfish and therefore unethical. By seeking immortality of the self we are taking away from the cycle of life. We should die knowing that we have left behind something to help, not continue living to make resources hard to come by.
Point:Just like the medical technology we already have to enhance and prolong our lives, whatever technique we use to become immortal will be another tool. Tools by themselves are ethically neutral. If humans decide to hoard the technology or only sell it at an extortionately high price, it will be unethical behaviour, but it won't make the technology itself unethical. Debating what the dangers of immortality are is vital - to bring immortality into the world in a rash, ignorant way would itself be unethical - but calling immortality, as a concept, 'unethical' is false.
Counterpoint:It is unethical since the science will not be freely and equally distributed when/if it is practised.
Point:Aging is the greatest killer, as Nick Bostrom argues aging “is a tyrant that kills us by the cartload – and what do we do to stop it?”[1] It is a moral imperative that we should attempt to stop this killer. Yet many argue that immortality is unethical. It seems people have dismissed the point at hand because they have simply not thought long enough about it. We measure and judge ourselves in relation to life and death all the time, and we act accordingly: Life a positive; death a negative. We work constantly to keep ourselves alive, by eating by staying safe; everything we do is aimed at preserving life. But we don't carry that principle into the specific study of immortality and the ethics of trans-humanism in general. To dismiss immortality as unethical is equivalent to dismissing our most basic of human instincts, that of survival, and the primacy of human life in morality and science.
Counterpoint:Immortality with superlative health; for each and every one of us; is arguably ethical. Albeit if a means to achieve immortality was invented; it would be patented not freely distributed. Immortality is not the same as being disease-free. Suffering and ageing would in all probability continue, just in different ways. The age-gene is not the death-gene; there is no death gene; so to speak.
Point:The holy books of all three Monotheist religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism) claim that Prophets like Noah and Adam lived to be about a thousand years (far longer than the highest recorded lifespan of the modern human; less than 200 years).1 The claim that longevity is irreligious can be easily shirked off, taking into account these religious parables.
Counterpoint:Death is mortality. Immortality in the afterlife requires mortality in this one, at least in the physical sense. We are encouraged to employ various strategies to bring us closer to heaven/a better-next-life.
