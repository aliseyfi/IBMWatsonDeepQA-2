Point:The USA is by far the world’s biggest economy and it should do more to pay its share of the Global Fund’s funding needs.
Counterpoint:The Global Fund is an obligation that the whole world should be meeting, not just the United States. In August 2011 the Economist issued a report explaining that the real GDP in most rich economies is still below its level at the end of 2007. In contrast, emerging economies’ (India, China, Brazil …) output has jumped by almost 20% over the same period. The rich world’s woes have clearly hastened the shift in global economic power towards the emerging markets. Actually the emerging economies account for 46% of world retail sales, 52% of all purchases of motor vehicles and 82% of mobile phone subscriptions. Almost a quarter of the Fortune Global 500 firms come from emerging markets; in 1995 it was only 4%.[1] As the economic power shifts to countries other than the US it is also logical that other countries should increase their funding for such foreign aid programs far more. China, Brazil, India are the ones that have the resources to increase funding due to the economic growth. The US is, given their current economic status, doing more than enough to help support the global fund. Why should America, having been in economic decline, contribute more than the “emerging countries”? The pressure of giving more should be put on those countries rather than the US.
Point:America is seen by many people over the world as an influential country that paves the way in international policies. An increase in funding will also have therefore a major effect on other donor countries. With the increased funding of the USA, there will also be a greater demand to invest more from other countries.
Counterpoint:Why should other countries be incentivized in the future to give more if the USA, the biggest contributor, is going to be doing more? This will simply encourage other countries to think that the US will contribute the necessary funding. The US has already done enough to be a good role model for other countries when it comes to supporting the Global Fund. An increase in support therefore will not have the wished for effect and should not be implemented.
Point:The US should show through spending on aid, the values it wants to promote in its humanitarian projects. Therefore well managed and effective projects should get more funding, and giving more funding to the Global Fund is the first step in this “re-education” of NGOs. This will serve other projects as a pointer what they have to do in order to receive more support and also set an example how projects must work in order to get increased funding.
Counterpoint:First of all it is immoral to tie funds that could decide on the life or death of a person to some policy restrictions a government seems to believe in. It is also wrong to assume that If an effective initiative has a high number of employees that they should not be eligible for increased funding. Countries funding the global fund should do so by weighing up the benefits increased funds would bring, rather than how the organization is structured.
