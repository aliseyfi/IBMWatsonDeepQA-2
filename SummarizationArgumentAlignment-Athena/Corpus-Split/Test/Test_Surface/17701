Point:In many places in the world food is scarce; tobacco farming uses up land that could otherwise be used for food production. By subsidising tobacco farming states take away from their ability to provide food for their own citizens as well as their ability to export food to other areas.
Counterpoint:The money people get from tobacco farming can be used to buy food in from other areas. Money from tobacco sales can be used to provide infrastructure, health facilities and education1.
Point:Governments spend a huge amount of money on helping people stop smoking; in the UK the government spends annually annually £83.9m on services to help people stop smoking and a further £61.8m on stop smoking medication 1. For the EU and states around the world to go out of their way to subsidise tobacco farming undermines these sorts of public health initiatives. Governments should be consistent in their subsidies and taxes rather than encouraging an industry with subsidies and then taking money away again with increased taxes.
Counterpoint:Countries like the UK may choose to spend money on helping people stop smoking without any regard to the economies of tobacco producing countries if they wish. However tobacco producing countries do not owe anything to the UK and should not harm their own economies in order to help public health drives in countries that are richer than themselves.
Point:It is nearly impossible to justify the state spending huge amounts of money on something that causes such large amounts of harm. About half of regular cigarette smokers will be eventually killed by their habit with 100,000 smokers dying from smoking related causes every year in the UK.1
Counterpoint:The state has no place whatsoever in dictating lifestyle choices to its citizens. Citizens who chose to smoke are not ignorant of the risks; they choose to smoke in spite of them. The state does however have a place supporting its economy. Subsidies can help areas of the economy grow where they would otherwise falter, creating a huge number of jobs and possibly an industry that might be self sustaining in the future. In the USA, which subsidises it's tobacco producers, an estimated 2.7 million jobs are dependent on the tobacco industry1 there would be a great harms on the American economy if subsidies were not maintained. Given that tobacco farming is heavily concentrated takes place in a few areas in America, particularly around Virginia and Kentucky, it would be hard for the rest of the economy to 'pick up the slack' in these heavily dependent areas2.
