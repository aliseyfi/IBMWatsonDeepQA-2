Point:Once people leave compulsory education the relationship they have with the state changes dramatically. The state no longer has so great a duty of care. Their option, other than going to university, would normally be to get a job. In doing so they are in an open competition. It seems unreasonable that universities should not treat them in the same way as a company would. Universities, like companies, should therefore have to compete for the best academic talent and there should be a level playing field in this competition rather than setting quotas or giving a leg up for students whether it is for the poor or for those native to the country where the university is located.
Counterpoint:The state has invested in the individual student and in the university as an institution, it is therefore a stakeholder. A university is, therefore in a significantly different position to a private company which is a more obviously independent actor.
Point:If universities are expected to become increasingly self-funding (in the case of many nations they already are entirely self-funded) it is unfair to restrict whatever advantages they may have to succeed. Equally those universities in a country which simply aren’t up to scratch should not be guaranteed the luxury of an inbuilt base of domestic students.
Counterpoint:This is simply unfair to nations with less developed tertiary sectors who would lose all of the little advantage they currently have. Even accepting the analogy with a market place, the results would work poorly for education – just as they have for many involved in free markets in other sectors. The reality of a free market is not that it improves standards across the board but, rather, that it produces a handful of global leaders – usually those who had all of the advantages to start with – and the rest of them go to the wall.[i]
Point:The predominant role of tertiary education is skilling people for the workplace. This is done either through direct vocational training or the somewhat more pedagogical ‘shaping of the mind’. Universities also provide the setting for acquiring skills of socialization that allow people to function as independent citizens outside the family home.
Counterpoint:The vast majority of graduates will find their work in their country of birth. In a survey of international students in U.S. universities “only 6 percent of Indian students, 10 percent of Chinese students and 15 percent of European students said they wanted to remain permanently” in the U.S.[i] To design the entire education system to the benefit of these people who will not end up benefiting the economy is perverse.
