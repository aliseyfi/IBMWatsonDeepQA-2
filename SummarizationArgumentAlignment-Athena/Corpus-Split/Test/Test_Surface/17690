Point:Federal states are able to remove trade barriers between members which would otherwise exist if there were independent states (such as difficulties in moving goods due to borders). This increases internal trade and economic growth and encourages investors.1 Federal units are able to share resources and concentrate on producing what they are best at (called comparative advantage) at a better economy of scale. Even in cases of agreed free trade areas between states, there is no overarching authority to ensure timely compliance to agreements.2 Finally, larger economic units are more able to influence international trade regimes.31 EU Business, 2007, 'EU Single Market- benefits,' [10]Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, 2007, 'Guide to Benefits of the EU,' [11]2BBC [12], 2011, 'US and Mexico end cross-border trucking dispute [12]3Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2010, 'Federalism [9]
Counterpoint:Free trade areas are able to operate quite successfully even if they lack an overarching authority and full integration of currencies, such as NAFTA.1Economic homogenisation is not necessarily a good thing. Common currencies are best deployed in Optimal Currency Area, which are areas with sufficiently similar economies that a common currency can successfully function. Problems exist where there is a lack of political capital between nations in a federation or when there are logistical barriers (such as the different languages within the EU or the differing strength of public finances).2 There is no reason why federal states are required for comparative advantage to exist, though economies of scale could be less.1 Office of the United States Trade Representative, 2004, 'NAFTA: A Decade of Success,' [13]. 2Wikipedia [14], 2011, 'Optimal Currency Area [14]
Point:Federal states allow local decision making to suit local needs due to their tiered decision making structures. This ensures that citizens are able to determine how they should live their lives without infringing upon the rights of citizens in other federal units who may have different opinions. However on security matters which affect the entire federal state, citizens are better protected because the federal units are stronger together than apart. A federal state also creates a common sense of purpose than can dissuade conflict between the federal units. A good historical example of this behaviour was the agreement of the Swiss Cantons to come together to collectively protect and enrich themselves from outside threats in 1848.11 History of Switzerland, 'Switzerland's History,' [21]
Counterpoint:States should not be overly concerned with size as a measure of strength since this is merely increasing the area that needs defending. Instead they should be concerned with having common sense of identity that encourages cooperation. Russia, Nigeria and India are examples of large federated states which suffer from internal insurgencies caused by political grievances.1 The Democratic Republic of the Congo is an excellent example of a large federated state which has proven incapable of defending its borders.2 It may be the case a common identity is better formed in independent nation states. Smaller states like Monaco and Singapore continue to exist with relative security in contrast.1 AlertNet, 2011, 'Bin Laden death weakens Russia insurgency- official,' [22]The Washington Post, 2006, 'Grievances Fuel Insurgency, Says Nigeria Media [23]'Inside the Maoist insurgency in India's Jharkand state', BBC News [24]
Point:It is not clear what the logical end point for splitting countries over political differences would be. Since each individual has a unique set of preferences, or at least there are large numbers of groups of people with different preferences, the state must aggregate preferences at some point. It makes more sense for the state to aggregate preferences in such a way that creates effective states that can meet their (aggregate) goals rather than attempting to find "pure" nation states. Furthermore, nations are often scattered in areas which do not provide a clear location for a state. An example of this is Eastern Europe or Africa where ethnic groups and tribes regularly cross state boundaries and exist as unconnected pockets.1 It would be impossible to create states to cater to these groups.1 Guardian, 2007, 'Biafran Lessons,' [25]
Counterpoint:It is true that there are few states which include homogenous national groups. However, there are some (Iceland and Japan for example) but there are many states which are predominantly a single "nation." And given that proposition has accepted that nations are constructed, it is possible for people to opt-into nationhood. Thus autonomous nation states can exist where groups of people agree to live with common cultural and political values. Therefore, it is not futile to attempt to accommodate a common set of political values within a state. Indeed, it is necessary to have some kind of common history, culture, practices or ethnicity often to bind groups together.11Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2010, 'Federalism,' [9]
Point:Federal states tend to be larger and have different economic cycles. This allows the overall state to cope with different economic cycles by using fiscal transfers (tax) between wealthier states and poorer states to fund government programmes.1 So for example if Mississippi and New Mexico were paying for all their services themselves from their own taxes they would have debts of over 500% of GDP,2 however at the beginning of the Republic it was the Southern States who were the richest due to their cotton wealth.1Euro [27] Economics, 'Example: Fiscal Transfer [27]2The [28] Economist, 2011, 'America's Fiscal Union: Greek Americans,' [28]
Counterpoint:In most cases parts of federated states remain in similar economic positions relative to other sections. California and Texas are regularly the most economically successful US states. Rather than receive economic benefit, they have federal taxes transferred to the weakest performing states in the Union. A similar argument is apparent with the German bailouts in the 2010-11 Eurozone financial crisis.11The Economist, 2011, 'America's Fiscal Union: Greek Americans,' [28]The Economist, 2011, 'German business and politics: Goodbye to Berlin,' [29]
