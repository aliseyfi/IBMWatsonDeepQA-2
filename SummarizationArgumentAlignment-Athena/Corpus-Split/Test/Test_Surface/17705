Point:Rainforests are responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover1, which is why they have been labelled the 'Lungs of the Earth'. Their role in maintaining breathable air is vital as the world population continues to increase exponentially. The rainforests are also a key carbon sink; they are thought to limit the greenhouse effect of global warming by absorbing and storing carbon, hence reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere2. Rainforests help to offset global carbon emissions. "To get an idea of the value of the sink, the removal of nearly five billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forest, based on realistic prices for a tonne of carbon, should be valued at around 13 billion pounds per year. This is a compelling argument for conserving tropical forests"3.In addition, it has been calculated that 12%-14% of global carbon emissions come from the deforestation of rainforests in countries such as Brazil and Indonesia4.1 'Killer Inhabitants of the Rainforests' by GSerrano, 4th January 2009 [5]2 'Amazon carbon sink effect "slows"', BBC 10th March 2004 [6]3 'Climate and Energy: COP15 Copenhagen 2009' [7]4 'Seeing Redd in Cancun' by Simon Counsell, The Guardian 8th December 2010 [8]
Counterpoint:To encourage countries to invest in protecting rainforests international bodies are offering countries 'carbon credits'. The US is proposing to spend $25bn on protecting rainforests. However the proposal is based upon carbon credits, allowing investors to earn carbon-emission credits in return for saving trees. This means that for however much they invest into protecting the rainforest, they will be allowed to emit around one tonne of carbon dioxide. A ban on deforestation may in the end be counterproductive. "Awarding tradable credits to countries that reduce deforestation will cause carbon prices to plummet worldwide and may make global warming worse by pulling investors away from renewable energy, an economic study found"1.
Point:A ban on unsustainable logging is possible by creating sustainable alternatives. Regulation can protect forests. In the U.S., the State of California, the federal government and Pacific Lumber Company reached agreement to protect the Headwaters forest. The agreement bans logging in certain areas so as to protect Headwaters' eco-system. Pacific Lumber can log 425,000 cubic metres in specially-protected buffer zones1.
Counterpoint:While creating a ban and providing alternatives are useful and may reduce unsustainable logging they will never manage to eliminate it entirely. While wood fetches a high price it will always be worthwhile engaging in illegal logging. As there is no red tape and trees are readily available it is simple and cheap to engage in illegal logging which will almost always be done unsustainably.
Point:Deforestation is often used as a tool for leverage in politics. Frequently this involves collusion between the exploiters and government or the bribery of officials responsible for enforcement of conservation regulations or for the protection of reserves. Corruption often begins at high levels and continues all the way down the government hierarchy. Even if corruption is not outright in terms of bribes, logging companies may seek concessions, low fees and taxes, or the waiving of international regulations in return for offering governments a percentage of the revenues from the sale of the wood. Governments then use the revenues gained from this deforestation for political gain, either through feeding some of it back into society or by providing the newly created land to landless migrants. In a more sinister example, logging was used by the Khmer Rouge to fund its civil war in Cambodia1. Governments in tropical countries often feel that exploitation of natural resources is an opportunity for economic gain. For instance, in the 1980?s, Malaysia, Indonesia and The Philippines exported 85 million cubic meters of wood (4% of the global wood supply), worth about $3 billion2, which has since grown to be one of their main industries. This gives the government credibility as an economic force for good, though the sacrifice is sustainability and a condoning (even encouraging) of illegal logging. And an indefinable amount of the profits are siphoned off into the private funds of some government officials, unbeknownst to the population.
Counterpoint:Deforestation should not be used for political purposes and prohibiting logging would be an unnecessarily extreme response as there are mechanisms to encourage countries to use more sustainable forestry methods. If the financial incentives are great enough, and threats over trade embargos are sincere enough, logging companies and governments will come to seek World Bank loans to finance their forestry operations and as a result must comply with its rules regarding "sustainable harvesting".
Point:Local indigenous people rely on areas of the tropical rainforests for their homes, provision for food, fuel and small-scale subsistence farming. The Amazon rainforest is the ancestral home of one million people and contains 400 human tribes, many of whom have never had contact with the outside world1; they eat many plant foods such as oranges, yams and bananas, and bushmeats such as wild pigs. Their traditional small-scale slash and burn farming techniques and hunting cause about the same amount of damage to the rainforest as a tree falling and the plants are allowed enough time that they can easily re-colonise. Similarly, there are 15 un-contacted tribes in the Peruvian Amazon, but their ancient way of life is under threat because more than 70% of the Peruvian rainforest has been leased to oil companies for exploration2. In the past, oil exploration has led to violent and disastrous contact with isolated Indians. In the early 1980s, exploration by Shell led to contact with the isolated Nahua tribe; within a few years more than 50% of the Nahua had died2. In 1996 illegal loggers forced contact with the Murunahua Indians. In the following years over 50% of them died, mainly from colds, flu and other respiratory infections2.These small tribes cannot adapt to life outside the rainforest and will die out, taking with them ancient ways of life. They could have valuable lessons to teach us about how to utilise ecosystems by working in harmony with them.
Counterpoint:Indigenous people have no communal land ownership rights. This means that governments have the right to offer land to those moving in with proposals to use the land to its full potential1; these local tribes do not contribute to the economy of these disastrously poor countries. Tribes must learn to adapt to an expanding and urbanising world.
Point:Deforestation has long-term environmental impacts. There is a causal connection between deforestation, loss of biodiversity and climate change. Rainforests are the most diverse habitats on earth; they cover only 6% of the land surface of the world but scientists estimate they have over 50% of the earth's plants and animals1. Experts estimate that we are losing 137 plant, animal and insect species every single day due to rainforest deforestation: that equates to 50,000 species a year2.Moreover rainforests are not unproductive habitats. Not only are they aesthetically pleasing, they are also socially and economically important. They have many plants that are used in medicines. For example, the US National Cancer Institute has identified 3000 plants that are active against cancer cells; 70% of these plants are found in the rainforest2. Indeed, 25% of the active ingredients in today's cancer-fighting drugs come from organisms found only in the rainforest2. There are still many plants to be discovered that could further aid medical research. If we lose this biodiversity, we will lose our ability to utilise these species for our own benefit and the benefit of future generations on Earth.1 'Tropical Rainforest' by Michael G, 2002 [17]2 'Deforestation in the Amazon: Facts' by Ryan Walters [1]
Counterpoint:The environmental effects of deforestation are exaggerated (satellite pictures show that despite decades of exploitation, over 85% of Brazil's Amazon jungle region is still covered in trees1) and, in any event, are less important to developing countries than economic growth. Some scientists estimate that deforestation, if continued at its current pace, will only reduce species in tropical forests by 5-10% in the next 30 years1.
