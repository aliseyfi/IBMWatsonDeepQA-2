Point:As a society we should put effort into helping those suffering from mental illness and detention is one way of being sure that they are receiving and maintain treatment. This also means that doctors are able to keep an eye on patients so that if the patient is no longer a risk, they can be let out. If patients are detained then doctors will have a better idea of their patient's usual behaviour and therefore be better at reading their symptoms.
Counterpoint:This could lead to doctors who diagnose certain psychiatric disorders effectively becoming jailers, and this is not their job or responsibility. Some doctors may refuse to be and many medical professionals will avoid identifying a patient as having DSPD if they know that this may result in their patient being detained. This could result in people with dangerous mental health problems going entirely unidentified– far worse than the current situation.
Point:The public is at risk from people with known dangerous mental health problems. Two people are killed every month by Care in the Community patients in the UK (Care in the community described in Scrapbook). Jonathan Zito was stabbed to death by Christopher Clunis in 1992; Jason Mitchell beheaded his father and strangled two pensioners in 1994; Stephen Laudat killed his grandfather in 1994, believing him to be the gang leader Ronnie Kray; John Rous stabbed care worker Jonathan Newby to death in 1995; Michael Stone killed Lin and Megan Russell in a field near their home in 1996. All of these killers had diagnosed mental illnesses but could not be detained under UK law, yet if they had been detained many lives would have been saved. Currently, people with mental health problems who have not committed an offence may only be detained for the purposes of treatment, and may avoid treatment if they can argue that they will receive no benefit from it. There is no known effective treatment for Dangerous Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD). This means that people with DSPD fall through a gap between the criminal justice system and the healthcare system– they cannot be treated, so they never get less dangerous, but they cannot be detained, so the public cannot be protected from them. Furthermore it seems it is not unreasonable to detain people who you have good grounds to suspect could be dangerous as we already detain potentially dangerous people who do not have mental health problems anyway, if authorities believe they may be terrorists. 1
Counterpoint:DSPD is not a psychiatric diagnosis, but a legal category therefore it is not surprising that it cannot be treated. It is a convenient label, however, for people whom the government fears and would like to have an excuse to detain, and who are unlikely to generate strong public sympathy. Rather than demonising and detaining people, the government should be providing mental health services which work in partnership with the people they are supposed to be helping.
Point:People who are mentally ill are significantly more of a danger to themselves than to others with only 5% of homicides being committed by people with mental illness.1 Detention is one way of preventing people suffering from mental illness to harm themselves or anyone else, and this must be in the best interest of the patient. Some people who are mentally unwell may attempt to commit suicide or get caught up in a cycle of self deprecating thoughts. However, patients in detention can be monitored; therefore similarly to the issue of Argument One, it seems important to detain patients in order to save them from themselves.
Counterpoint:Detention can never truly be in the patient's interest. Detention has been known to have damaging effects on mental health1 and thus is perhaps the worst thing that could be done for the individual. The fact that DSPD is not a treatable condition means that people described as having it will, once detained, effectively be abandoned– they will not be able to be offered alternative treatment which might improve their condition and make their release more likely. Unlike other detained psychiatric patients, their detention has no clear goal and it is difficult to see how anyone could argue for their release on the grounds of improvement.
Point:The 2007 British mental health act1 was actually created partly in order to update the Mental Health Act 1983 so that it conforms to current human rights law. The process of sectioning ensures this by having two separate doctors diagnose the patient as both mentally ill and a threat to themselves or others; these diagnoses are then presented to an independent AMP (approved medical practitioner) who makes the decision about whether or not the individual can be detained. If a doctor or AMP believes this should be extended to 28 days, then the process is repeated again independently. Therefore they should be no concerns about these detentions violating anyone's human rights.
Counterpoint:Pre-emptive indefinite detention is potentially in breach of the ECHR and the Human Rights Act. Article 5 (Right to liberty and security), Article 6 (Right to a fair trial) and Article 8 (Right to respect for private and family life) are all threatened by the proposals1. It is best to avoid making legislation which the European Court of Human Rights will rule to be illegal; it is best to avoid making legislation which breaches human rights in any case.
