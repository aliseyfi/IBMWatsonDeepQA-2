Point:Whatever the good intentions of zoo-keepers, animals in zoos suffer. They are inevitably confined in unnaturally small spaces, and are kept from the public by cages and bars. A study of British zoos found that elephant enclosures were 1000 times smaller than their natural habitats1. Wild polar bears are confined 'in spaces that are more than a million times smaller than their arctic territory.'1 They suffer psychological distress, often displayed by abnormal or self-destructive behaviour. Aquatic animals do not have enough water, birds are prevented from flying away by having their wings clipped and being kept in aviaries. Furthermore, the locations of zoos in urban areas leads to incidents like the fox attack at London Zoo in 2010 that killed 11 South African and Rockhopper penguins2. 1 GreenMuze Staff.

Counterpoint:Wild animals do not suffer in well-regulated, well-run zoos. There have in the past been many bad zoos and cruel zookeepers. It is imperative that these are reformed and weeded out. The Animal Welfare Act, enacted by the United States in 1970, is a good example of a step that can be taken to ensure all animals are treated appropriately and not misused or harmed1. Good zoos in which animals are well fed and well looked after in spacious surroundings are becoming the norm and should be encouraged. Zoos can exist without cruelty to animals, however, and so the fact that there are animal welfare problems with some zoos does not meant that all zoos should be shut down. 1 Grech, K. S. (2004).

Point:Adults and children visiting zoos will be given the subliminal message that it is OK to use animals for our own ends, however it impinges on their freedom or quality of life. Therefore zoos will encourage poor treatment of animals more generally. People do not go to zoos for educational reasons they simply go to be entertained and diverted by weird and wonderful creatures seen as objects of beauty or entertainment. Dale Marcelini, a zoo curator in Washington, conducted a study that found 'visitors spend less than 8 seconds per snake, and one minute per lion.'1Otherwise, 'most people preoccupied themselves with eating, resting and shopping…people treated the exhibits like wallpaper’ 1. As a form of education the zoo is deficient: the only way to understand an animal properly is to see it in its natural environment – the zoo gives a totally artificial and misleading view of the animal by isolating it from its ecosystem.
Counterpoint:Zoos do not encourage the use of animals as mere entertainment. This argument assumes that both the harm suffered by these animals is tremendous and the only value gained from zoos is human entertainment. However, the motives of the general public and the professional zoo keepers are not one and the same. Zoo keeping is a trained profession. Animals in the zoo have regular access to good food and vets on standby should they fall ill. This is a far more luxurious lifestyle than they would have in their natural habitat. Furthermore, within zoos animals have many benefits that wild animals are deprived of, from human understanding to biological study. To see zoos as pure entertainment is myopic.
Point:States concerned with the protection and welfare of wild animals are able to close zoos, release the animals back into their natural habitats and thereafter enforce immigration regulation that would ensure they any live cargo entering the country would be searched and checked. If found to contain wild animals, they could be sent back to where they had arrived from and hopefully re-placed in their natural habitat. To cut supply would be inadvertently to reduce demand, and eventually ensure that the trade in live animals would cease, to the benefit of the wild animal populations themselves.
Counterpoint:Sending the trade underground is not the most effective means to ensure the protection and conservation of wild animals. A general populace with previous first-hand exposure to wild animals will not lose their appetite to them if zoos were closed, fostering a demand for a black market in the trade of live, wild animals. As such, the most effective means to protect and conserve the populations of wild animals is regulation of the zoos themselves, not restrictions on their very entry to the state. Furthermore, the release of previous-captive animals into their 'natural' habitats is not advisable, they are not fit to survive in an environment where food is not provided and predators not kept separate.
Point:Animals belong in their natural habitat, in the wild. It is a breach of their natural rights to take them by force into captivity for our own purposes. They are 'prevented from gathering their own food, developing their own social orders and generally behaving in ways that are natural to them.'1 No matter how we may try to replicate their surrounding in a zoo, we will never achieve the full result. Predators need to hunt and taking from them their ability to do so by taming/caging/drugging them is beyond cruel. A study by the journal Science in 2008 found that 'Asian elephants in European zoos had a median lifespan of just 18.9 years compared to 41.7 years for wild elephants in an Asian logging camp.'2 Excessive human involvement in the food cycle has disrupted it considerably. Let nature take its course. 1 Jamieson, D. (1985). Against Zoos. Retrieved June 1, 2011, from Animal Rights Library: [4] 2 Berhaupt, N. A. (2011, May 13). Zoos and animals in capitivity.

Counterpoint:The truth is that these claims are based around the logically-skewed ideas of animal rights groups. Their arguments have little or no factual basis/merit for we cannot measure animal happiness. We cannot really say that they would be best left in the wild. All we can do is review the information at hand. Domesticated animals; treated well, would you say they were unhappy? Well then how can we argue that taking animals out of the wild is wrong? We cannot. So rather than banning zoos, we should ensure that relevant safety measures are in place to ensure that these animals are as well looked after as possible. Human beings are part of the animal kingdom thus food cycle and our involvement is part of nature.
