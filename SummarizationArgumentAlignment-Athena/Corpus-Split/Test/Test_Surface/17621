Point:DRM has a 'Chilling effect' on genuine technological research, preventing legitimate reverse-engineering of technologies for research purposes, particularly in university departments which don't get funding for this because of the potential legal issues. In the USA the DMCA has also been cited as chilling to legitimate users, such as students of cryptanalysis (including, in a well-known instance, Professor Felten and students at Princeton), and security consultants such as Niels Ferguson, who has declined to publish information about vulnerabilities he discovered in an Intel secure-computing scheme because of his concern about being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the US.[1]
Counterpoint:Those not committing illegal acts have nothing to fear from the media industry. Those who are not committing illegal acts have nothing to fear from the media industry. However, if PhD students who engage in some casual software piracy on the side are deterred from their ‘research’ by the threat of potential legal action, then that is a good consequence of DRM. The Oxford Internet Institute has shown that the interests of budding and experienced cryptographers can be put to far better use reverse engineering the software behind the great firewall of China, aiding the spread of freedom of information and democracy rather than focussing on DRM software.[1]
Point:It is generally accepted in most legal jurisdictions that copying media for the use of others is a form of stealing and should remain illegal. However, this should be enforced by targeting pirates who produce large quantities of copied media in bulk, rather than targeting innocent or low-impact home users sharing songs with a friend or transferring a song from a CD to an MP3 player for listening on the move. Such home users make little difference to the viability of the media or software industries, but the actions of pirates impact upon their ability to make profits from the intellectual property they own. A good example of this is the DRM on the Blu-ray edition of the film Avatar which rendered the discs unplayable on many Blu-ray players.[1] DRM isn't effective against piracy and so we should see it as an anti-competitive practice and trade barrier which makes life worse for consumers and doesn't bring benefits to artists or the music industry in the long run.
Counterpoint:It should not be more important to target pirates. Treating commercial pirates and home users differently, despite the fact that they are both committing acts of piracy runs against the principle of the uniformity of the rule of law. Companies are within their rights to protect media just as if it were any other product. If anything, the prevalent view that low-level home piracy is a socially acceptable crime which hurts no-one, is a clear reason why home users should be treated as pirates. DRM software does not prevent legitimate use of a product, but it does aim to reduce the incidence of casual piracy which has been made easier by software such as BitTorrent and has resulted in over 60% of the software in most eastern European countries being pirate rather than legitimate.[1] Such casual piracy significantly harms the revenues of software and media firms, small and large.
Point:DRM technology should be considered an infringement on types of legitimate ‘fair use’ consumer use,[1] harming rights for consumers which are protected under the World Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty, 1996. DRM aims to make it impossible to create compilations of songs & videos that you already own. Microsoft Zune's limited sharing technology prevents unlimited streaming between two devices owned by the same individual. Activation schemes frequently incorrectly tell users that they are using pirated products when reinstallation is attempted after a crash (for instance the Windows 'Genuine Advantage' scheme). Further, DRM makes it very difficult for firms who operate thousands of computers to install multiple copies (volume licenses often do away with DRM), resulting in a huge economic cost to them in terms of having to install on every system separately. Evidence of an acknowledgement of this counter-productivity came when EMI stopped releasing Audio CDs with DRM in January 2007 because of the sheer number of CD players they were incompatible with. They themselves admitted that “the costs of DRM do not measure up to the results”.
Counterpoint:There is no fair use right that allows copying a product. There exists no ‘right’ to copy a product for personal use.[1] Opponents of DRM just think that the media industry is retailing a different product. If media firms choose to sell single-use or single-license media then that is their right and they should be able to use technologies to prevent the breach of this contract by users, be they home users or large corporations. The act of copying media involves no interpretation as in the case of a play which is performed; it is the simple duplication of the original. If you want to listen to a CD in two different locations, you need to take that CD between them or pay for another copy if you prefer. Further, even for interpretive reproduction (specifically the theatre), authors are still allowed to enforce restrictive sets of rights during their lifetime, preventing certain interpretations such as cross-casting. All digital media firms are doing is putting in place a technology to protect those rights.
Point:Continued reliance on DRM inhibits the industry shift towards new models of content management for the future. The media industry needs to preserve its revenue by moving in at least some ways in the direction of the Creative Commons agreement. DRM goes in exactly the opposite direction. It hurts the firms because it gives consumers a negative experience and places the burden on them to prove that they aren't pirating, but doesn't even stop those who actually pirate. Viacom's $1bn lawsuit against Google for their Youtube subsidiary could have acted to inhibit the growth of the web-video industry, preventing transition to a sustainable (per view?) model of revenue sharing. Youtube won the lawsuit, but a pay-per-view is not yet being used.[1]
Counterpoint:Shifts towards new models are not prevented by DRM. DRM and a shift towards Creative Commons licensing are not mutually exclusive, they can just apply to different forms of media or different content. Further, here again, governments should not act as agents to tip industries into following the perceived ‘right’ path for their future. Surely this is just as intuitively wrong as the thought of the government stepping into the VHS vs. Betamax debate. [1] in order to prevent the production of incompatible video – both would be a waste of resources. This argument is bizarre and is worryingly similar to those made in command economies during the 1980s.
