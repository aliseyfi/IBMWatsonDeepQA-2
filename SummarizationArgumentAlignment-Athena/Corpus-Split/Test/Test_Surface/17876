Point:Nationalism is a sense of fellow-feeling between group members. This promotes cooperation and social cohesion within the group. Nationalism and the identity it brings creates a social glue which binds otherwise different people together, that sense of social cooperation makes welfare, social security and medical programs much more likely and stronger. It also may make for a smoother political process when there is a solid basis for consensus. Those who are net contributors to the system need something to make them feel that what they are doing is worthwhile and in their interests; something a national identity provides as it creates a sense of belonging that transcends economic interests. In Canada for example those who strongly identify with Canada are much more likely to support redistribution and healthcare than those with low identification with Canada.[1] Societies with a healthy sense of nationalism are more likely to provide for each other and avoid the plight of poverty or poor health.
Counterpoint:Far from promoting cooperation and social cohesion nationalism as much divides nations as unites them. It is no longer the case that almost everyone in a country will identify themselves the same way as there are increasing population movements. Moreover very few nations’ borders fit ethnic or linguistic boundaries. This means that nationalism’s darker side will have much more of an impact. Nationalism causes internal ethnic violence through its narrative of racial superiority. This aspect of nationalism has caused numerous genocides, including but not limited to the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, and the ‘ethnic cleansing’ of the breakup of Yugoslavia. This is the inevitable result of nationalism's focus upon definition - "we" are "us" because we are not like "them" - and so encouragement to exclusion and antagonism. This applies as much to groups within the state, where "the other" is seen as both inferior and as a threat, as to other states with different ethnic and cultural traditions.
Point:Nationalism has been a potent force for self-determination in colonial territories. The profoundly misunderstood Vietnamese independence movement, as well as most African liberation movements of the 1940s and 1950s drew heavily on the idea of nationhood to mobilise their people against a foreign exploitative power. Other examples include India, Indonesia, Guinea, and Guyana. Most often these states, once independence has been achieved, see a fracturing of nationalism that prevents those nationalist impulses from being used to condone violence against minority populations. Meanwhile in big multi-ethnic states, most notably India and Indonesia nationalism has been used positively to keep the state and its many ethnicities united my making a higher level of identity above the regional identities that in many other areas of the world would have become a national identity.[1]
Counterpoint:While nationalism is a force for self-determination this is not always a good thing. The utility of such nationalism depends on at what level the nationalism is created – nationalism in India can be said to unite India but Tamil nationalism is a national identity at the level below and so is a source of disunity within a country that has already gained self-determination.
Point:Nationalism can take many benign forms, such as that of civic nationalism, where a shared sense of national identity is created and reinforced by institutions, not ethnicity or history. The starting point of civic nationalism is not an ethnic group but the state’s territorial borders. It focuses on citizenship, civic rights and legal codes where all citizens are equal.[1] Civic nationalism has taken firmest root in the United Kingdom and the United States. This is an inclusive kind of nationalism that accepts any individual into its institutions. Nationalism can provide cultural and political glue for strong democratic institutions that can win out over forms of ethnic exclusion or political repression.
Counterpoint:Nationalism is only benign in the sense that it is an improvement on local tribalism – the good is derived from the expanded size of the group for which individuals are willing to work towards the advantage of. By these standards civic nationalism is definitely a step forward and is much less divisive than any ethnically based nationalism but it does not go far enough. The natural conclusions of this reasoning is that the greatest good would come from us moving beyond nationalism and conceive of ourselves as being collective members of the human race, or further, as a part of the ecosystem of the Earth.
Point:According to Isaiah Berlin, “The ‘physiognomies’ of cultures are unique: each presents a wonderful exfoliation of human potentialities in its own time and place and environment. We are forbidden to make judgments of comparative value, for that is measuring the incommensurable.”[1] A plurality of nations, especially in the modern era, can allow for cultural development and cultural exchange that benefits both parties. The human variety offered by national feeling makes the world a better place, through the diversity offered by the cultures that nationalism nurtures and protects.
Counterpoint:Diversity is not always a good thing – there are major advantages to there being less diversity if it means that we can understand each other. Better understanding does not just mean less conflict but is also beneficial to the economy as there can be more trade – something which nationalism can often block due to worries over other countries taking jobs.
