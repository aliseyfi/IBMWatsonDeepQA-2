Point:The problem in today’s society is that marriage has become for many people a piece of paper; they sign and, just as easily, terminate when things go wrong. Actually to a 2006 survey of 2134 women, 31 % thought marriage is no longer relevant in today’s society and 71 % of couples thought that marriage happens too many times without thinking it through first.[1]
Counterpoint:Making it a “harder to get in, harder to get out” bond is not the solution to problems within a marriage. Many ordinary couples make a conscious, well-intentioned yet ultimately mistaken decision when choosing to get married. Many things can happen, such as change in priorities, financial problems; unmet needs are among the most common reasons for divorce.[1]
Point:In a covenant marriage, the offended spouse is the only one who can ask for the divorce. This gives the offended spouse many benefits in negotiating the end of the marriage. The “stay at home” spouse has clearly more to lose in assuming a marriage will last forever, especially if he/she puts her/his career on hold to care for children. A covenant marriage is a way for the individual to have more security in marriage. Many times, it happens that one of the spouses (usually the wife) has never established credit in her own name. And experts explain it's easier for a 15-year-old to get a credit card than it is for a 50-year-old divorced woman. She just gets deleted, from all the affairs.[1] Society as a whole has an interest in protecting the individual.
Counterpoint:Yes, in the past it really did happen that the criteria at divorces on how to help the spouses to get back into single life were unfair. Judges until currently were on their own in deciding how to prioritize the various factors and how to translate them into dollar amounts, resulting in wildly inconsistent alimony awards. When asked how much alimony a lifelong homemaker married to a doctor deserved, judges in an Ohio survey estimated as little as $5,000 a year and as much as $175,000.
Point:Passage of no-fault divorce laws resulted in an onslaught of divorce and a breakdown of the American family. In 1968, the year before California adopted the nation’s first no-fault divorce law, the US had 584 000 divorces (2.9 per 1 000 Americans). After 30 years of no-fault divorce, the number of divorces had reached 1 135 000 annually. Covenant marriages are the answer. Research has shown that 33% to 45% of couples on the brink of divorce may reconcile if they are legally prevented from divorcing for six months as specified in a covenant marriage.[1]
Counterpoint:This covenant marriage is no harder to escape than any other and if the spouse wants the divorce, they can easily travel to another state, to get the divorce they want in the heat of the discussion. Emory University explains that an estranged spouse can escape a covenant marriage simply by moving to and filing for divorce in any of the forty-seven American states or any number of foreign countries without covenant marriage options. Current conflict of laws rules, both domestic and international, do not favor the enforcement of covenant marriage laws over the contract marriage laws of the forum state where the divorce case is litigated.[1]
