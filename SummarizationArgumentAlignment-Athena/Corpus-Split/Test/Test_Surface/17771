Point:The state must pay compensation for the terrorist attacks because they are indirectly responsible for them. It is the state’s duty to ensure that its citizens act within the law by providing deterrents, education and by preventing crimes through the use of intelligence. Even if the terrorist atrocities do not take place within the state, they were most probably planned within the state or initiated by someone who lives in the state. This means that it was within the state’s power to have prevented the attack from taking place. Just as we would expect a state to investigate and track down a drug syndicate, we expect the state to track down terrorist organisations and prevent their activities.
Counterpoint:It is unjust to expect the state to prevent terrorist attacks. Most of the terror attacks are covert operations which are totally outside the purview of the government in the sense that the ruling mechanism has no idea that attacks are being planned. Why should any government be responsible for acts which it hasn't endorsed, authorised or has no knowledge of whatsoever? Terrorist organisations are complex and difficult to track down. They spread themselves in a variety of locations. The structure of most terrorist organisations is such that individuals only communicate with their immediate superior and do not know the identity or whereabouts of any other member of the organisation, making it very difficult to gather intelligence. Another reason why it is difficult to track down terrorists is their unwillingness to offer up information. Terrorists are in many cases willing to die for their cause and so there is very little that we can do to persuade them to give up other members of the organisation or their plans. In short, they work very hard at hiding their plans and their members. It is a testament to this fact the US government, with their sophisticated means of gathering intelligence, took years to locate Osama Bin Laden.
Point:If states are expected to pay compensation in this way then they are incentivised to take action against terrorist organisations to prevent incurring this massive cost. They are more likely to put resources into investigating leads and to take a hard stance on terrorist activity. This will decrease the prevalence of terrorism or at least make more intelligence available.
Counterpoint:Once again, this is unlikely to decrease terrorism because, as we explained, it is so very difficult to track down terrorists. Even if the state wants to deter terrorism they may not be able to.
Point:Compensation can prevent more violence because the victims are less likely to seek revenge if they feel that a) they have been recognised as victims b) the perpetrators (at least someone representing the perpetrators) has suffered financially and so some justice has been done c) they are more satisfied with the outcome of events because they have received money. This is less important in scenarios such as the London train bombings and 9/11 where there is little chance of victims retaliating but it is important in conflicts that have revenge as a common theme. For example, the Israel-Palestine conflict involves a lot of retaliation resembling age-old family feuds. Feuds are often prevented through the payment of blood money, in Saudi Arabia blood money rates are 100,000 Riyals to compensate for the death of a Muslim man.[1] Perhaps we could use similar compensation to prevent some of this retaliation by compensating victims in the case of terrorism victims.
Counterpoint:The Arab-Hebrew conflict, which started as a political and nationalist conflict over competing territorial ambitions cannot just be solved by paying some money and sweeping everything under the carpet. If this were to be the case, this conflict would have been long over and every crime against humanity also for that matter could be brushed aside by paying compensation. Both sides have a particular aim that they are fighting for which does not disappear with compensation.
Point:Often when a terrorist attack occurs the victims feel anger not only towards the individual perpetrators or the terrorist organisation but towards the entire national, political, cultural or religious group they belong to. An example of this is the flood of anti-Muslim, anti-Arab sentiment that arose after the 9/11 attacks.[1] This has a lot of negative consequences because it means that perfectly innocent people will suffer hate crimes and ostracization which in turns is likely to turn those people against the victims of the terrorist attack. This kind of disharmony lays the foundation for poor international relations, discrimination and particularly make it difficult for integration to occur such a when a Muslim family moves to the US.
Counterpoint:This is false. When the state pays compensation they are taking responsibility for the crime, as the proposition stated in their first argument, and in doing so they are associating themselves with the terrorists, not disassociating themselves as prop claims. Furthermore, if the state wanted to condemn terrorism they could simply release a statement doing so. This is a frank contradiction with props first argument.
Point:The times when reparations tend to be suggested are when there is a wound of sorts between two groups of people that needs to be healed in order for there to be closure and reconciliation. An example of this is after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa when compensation was given to victims of apartheid.[1] We would argue that terrorist attacks fit perfectly into this frame because terrorist attacks tend to be committed by one group with a particular political, religious or national identity against another group with a different political, religious or national identity. Compensation plays a role in reconciling these two groups.
Counterpoint:An injection of money does not reconcile a family to the death of a loved one. In South Africa there are still tensions between white and black people and some continue to call for a white tax and land reclaim so there is certainly not closure.
