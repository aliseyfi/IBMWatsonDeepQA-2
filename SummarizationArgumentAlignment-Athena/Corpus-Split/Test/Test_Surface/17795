Point:Israel’s security wall is a breach of international law. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague was asked by the United Nations General Assembly to consider the legality of the barrier and, in July 2004, it ruled that the security wall was a breach of international laws.[1] Specifically, it found that the Fourth Geneva Convention and international human rights conventions did apply in the Occupied Territories. The security wall breached the Geneva Convention because it assisted illegal settlements and its building injured private property owners.
Counterpoint:The opinion of the ICJ is advisory and, therefore, largely symbolic. In this case the Court was asked by the General Assembly to comment on a resolution which was already anti-Israel, so the form of the request prejudged the decision. It is shameful that the ICJ has allowed itself to be captured politically in this way. Moreover, Israel does not acknowledge the automatic jurisdiction of the ICJ and is therefore not bound to implement its rulings. The Occupied Territories were never part of a recognised state, and so the various international conventions do not apply there.
Point:Any short term security gain will be offset by growing Palestinian resentment against Israel, which could result in a greater number of suicide attacks in Israel. Israelis and Palestinians will need to learn to live side by side; building an eight metre high wall sends a clear message to Palestinians that Israel is hostile and unwilling to find a permanent solution that would suit both nations. When constructing the barrier through Jerusalem for example the wall splits communities, disrupts everyday life and declares that a shared sovereignty solution is no longer possible for the city both sides claim as their capital. When people’s lives are disrupted by something that they feel is unnecessary and discriminatory it is bound to increase resentment. In this case it is made worse by the barrier being sited on land the Palestinians consider theirs. It should therefore be no surprise if more Palestinians turn to the only way they see that they get any response from Israel - violence. It would be hard to find a better way to radicalise the inhabitants of East Jerusalem.
Counterpoint:Israel has a legitimate right to self-defence and the protection of its people. The barrier is intended to prevent Palestinian suicide bombers from crossing into Israel. Before the barrier was in place, 900 Israelis died in such attacks.[1] If there were no terror threat, there would be no need for a barrier. Since the construction of the security wall, it has been much more difficult for Palestinian terrorist groups to mount suicide attacks in Israel. For more than three years, no Palestinian terrorists have been able to get through the barrier to attack civilians.[2] A security measure which has saved the lives of countless innocent people demands our support and should be completed as soon as possible. East Jerusalem during the second intifada was relatively quiet precisely because it was cut off from the rest of the West Bank and the movement of the residents was restricted.[3]
Point:The Security wall could weaken the Palestinian position at any peace negotiations, as it affects the facts on the ground which in turn impact negotiations. Creating the barrier essentially unilaterally annexes land to Israel from the West Bank as that land is no longer accessible from the West Bank but is accessible with no restrictions from Israel. Many of these areas that are being ‘annexed’ are being annexed precisely because they include the Israeli settlements that have been built up in the West Bank so this land is being occupied by Israeli citizens who are having infrastructure built for them. The more this happens the more difficult it will be for Israel to give the land back later. Israel will rightly be able to claim that if only Israelis live within the barrier why should they give that land back as a majority of the population would be against it?
Counterpoint:The security barrier is only temporary and, therefore, will not affect any peace negotiations. Israel has made clear that it expects any border settlement to be negotiated with the Palestinians. The barrier will be moved or dismantled should there be a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Such an agreement will never take place, however, without proper security for Israelis. In this way, Israel’s security barrier will actually bring a full peace settlement closer.
Point:Israel’s security wall effectively annexes Palestinian territory. Palestinian leaders assert that the route chosen could lead to almost half of the cultivatable land in the West Bank being annexed.[1] This obviously reduces the viability of any eventual Palestinian state as it will need to rely more on imported food. Most western governments have criticised the barrier because part of its route departs from the so-called Green Line, Israel's pre-1967 boundary and the internationally recognised border.[2] The route is not based on security considerations, but is clearly political, concerned to tie the land around Israeli settlements to Israel. It also violates property rights, as thousands of acres of land have been taken away from Palestinian owners in order to build the wall and the wide strip of access tracks beside it. This is clearly wrong and a barrier that kept to the 1967 border would have allowed the Palestinians a viable future state while also providing security for Israel.
Counterpoint:The security barrier merely connects Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Civilians in the West Bank settlements deserve as much protection against terrorist attacks as anyone else. While the estimates that half of the West Bank could be annexed are blown out of proportion, Israel acknowledges that the barrier does sometimes depart from the Green Line and therefore includes parts of the so-called Palestinian territory. Yet “the fence is not political” as former Israeli defence minister Benjamin ben Eliezer put it.[1] Its exact route has been dictated only by security considerations, for example the need to prevent snipers having a clear line of sight on roads used by Israeli settlers.
