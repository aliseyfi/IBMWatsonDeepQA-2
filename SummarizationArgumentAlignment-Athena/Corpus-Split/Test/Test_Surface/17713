Point:Children whose parents smoke in the home are exposed to secondhand smoke without any choice; they can’t just leave to avoid the smoky air. Many studies have found a link between secondhand smoke exposure (through living or working with a smoker) and an increased risk of heart disease and lung cancer.[1] The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family”.[2] Because their respiration is hindered and their long term health is threatened, children who are being exposed to secondhand smoke against their will are therefore having their human rights infringed by their parents, and this properly subjects the parents to punishment.
Counterpoint:The right to a standard of living adequate to their health and well-being has to do with making sure children have a roof over their heads, enough food, and access to medicine --not mandating that parents should have to provide a completely sterile home environment. It is far-fetched to claim that parents who smoke around their children are ignoring their children’s human rights. For one thing, research on the effects of being exposed to secondhand smoke is subject to question, since it relies on questionnaires and human memory. [1] For another, there are alleged health risks from such simple things as living near a road[2] or eating a relatively unhealthy diet[3], and we do not say that a parent is being immoral if they choose to raise their children in a house that has a road nearby, or let their children periodically eat unhealthy foods.
Point:Studies have found that children with parents who smoke are much more likely to use drugs, and especially more likely to smoke cigarettes themselves.[1] Children learn about the dangers of smoking and drugs in school, and know that it can damage health, but their parents are the most influential figures in their lives. If they see their parents, supposedly responsible adults, constantly doing something, then they are bound to think that it is okay for them to do it too. Having a parent who smokes normalises smoking for the child, which is wrong. In order to prevent this from happening, it is necessary to make sure that parents do not smoke in front of their children by punishing them if they do.
Counterpoint:This same logic would call for punishment of other “bad” adult behaviour, such as drinking, gambling or even poor eating or exercise habits, when performed in front of children. In addition, the cause and effect of parental modelling on their child’s smoking decision is doubtful. Many different factors contribute to the likelihood with which a person will choose to start smoking. Children may be influenced more by peers and siblings than by their parents[1] If so, preventing parents from smoking in front of their children would probably not significantly impact the percentage of children who become smokers. People are more likely to smoke if, for example, they live in a poor area,[2] and if the family lives in a poor area the child will be subjected to numerous pro-smoking influences that persist in economically disadvantaged areas. Besides, children would likely still be aware that their parents smoked, as the parents would have to excuse themselves every time they wanted a cigarette and go somewhere specifically to smoke.
Point:Not being able to smoke in their home without risking punishment will make it much more difficult for parents to continue smoking, encouraging them to smoke much less or even give up altogether, which will improve their health. This can be seen in reports which show that there was a big decrease in the number of smokers in England after the ban on smoking in public places there,[1] presumably because they didn’t want to have to go outside all the time and be away from their friends every time they wanted to have a cigarette. Similarly, many parents will give up smoking to avoid having to leave their children every time they want to have a cigarette or risk being punished.
Counterpoint:Tobacco is legal. Smoking is legal. The state encroaches on basic freedoms when it punishes legal conduct for ulterior motives. Would the same logic justify punishing parents who drink alcohol in front of their children, because the inconvenience might reduce drinking among parents? Also, the desired indirect effect of punishing parents who smoke in front of their children may not be achieved. Other studies in England have shown that while the number of smokers trying to quit did increase shortly after the ban (on smoking in public places) was introduced there, numbers steadied again soon after that.[1] While the ban might have led to some people quitting at the beginning, many others continued to smoke despite the new law, obviously just finding somewhere else to do it. This shows that most smokers will just find a different way to continue their habit. This could have detrimental effects in the case of punishing parents who smoke around their children, since those parents might leave their children alone in the house while they go somewhere else to smoke, which is potentially dangerous. Instead of risking a scenario where children are periodically left alone during parental “smoke breaks”, parents should just be trusted to live their lives responsibly. It is unnecessary to bring in a legislation that would just inconvenience so many people.
Point:Given the high compliance rates of the bans on smoking in public places in countries like Scotland,[1] it is reasonable to predict that people will be just as law-abiding with a law that protects children from secondhand smoke in their homes. Part of the effect would deter parental smoking. They may not want to break the law and realize that it is a serious enough issue for children’s health that they should stop. Furthermore, friends, relatives and others who care about the health and well-being of children could be trusted to ensure that those flouting the new law would be highlighted to police. Other means of making enforcement workable would be to prohibit smoking in vehicles with children under age 14, violations observed by traffic police could be handled like other vehicle-related infractions.[2] After providing ample advance notice of the new law’s start date, fines for violations in the home could be enforced, with each repeat violation receiving an increased fine.
Counterpoint:Given the existence of groups campaigning against bans on smoking in public places (e.g., FOREST), it seems fair to say that this proposition would not be instantly accepted by all. Punishing parents for smoking around their children would be a much more invasive process than punishing people for smoking in pubs and restaurants, and people would be much less happy with it. As such, they are more likely to flout the law and do so in private, ensuring that the police will never be able to charge them with a violation of the new law.
