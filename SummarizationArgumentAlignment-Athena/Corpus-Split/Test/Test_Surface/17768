Point:Holocaust denial is extremely offensive to Holocaust victims and members of the persecuted groups. It is highly distressing for these people and removes a feeling of safety that everybody deserves. Due to the severity of the Holocaust, the proposition that it did not occur is an assault on a very fundamental part of one’s identity.
Counterpoint:Nobody holds the right to “not be offended.” Everyone has the right to complete free speech unless it directly harms another person. Making someone “uncomfortable” in no way justifies removing someone’s ability to exercise their free speech.
Point:Holocaust denial encourages further anti- Semitism. Those who deny the Holocaust are anti-Semitic, usually regarding it as a myth spread by Jews to justify the creation of Israel. This creates the idea of a “Jewish conspiracy” which entrenches suspicion, hatred and discrimination towards Jews. The more available such opinions are in public, the more people will engage with them and those who would otherwise keep quiet about their fermenting prejudices feel they are part of a larger group which gives them confidence to air their racist opinions. So, Holocaust denial can be seen as a hate-crime, since its aim is to perpetuate racial myths.
Counterpoint:The overwhelming public consensus is that the Holocaust did indeed occur. It seems very unlikely that most individuals are going to be persuaded by poor or fabricated evidence that this is not the case. Indeed, by bringing Holocaust denial into the open and being able to directly challenge its beliefs we are able to dissuade people from being convinced by its falsities by being able to actively engage with the denial community. Communities which are underground are much harder to directly engage with, and find it easier to foster a sense of conspiracy that makes their views more plausible to potential recruits. Finally, openness makes it easier to monitor such groups and punish them if they do indeed begin to engage in directly illegal and harmful activities, such as political subversion or racial motivated assaults.
Point:Holocaust denial being debated in the public sphere implies that it is a legitimate point of view to hold.
Counterpoint:Debating the matter does not mean that Holocaust denial will appear a legitimate intellectual position. In fact, it will be shown to be wholly without merit and Holocaust deniers will be exposed as anti-Semitic liars. It is dangerous to argue that the matter should not be debated: Holocaust deniers will say that this is an admission that academic argument is not strong enough to defeat their beliefs.
Point:Impressionable members of the public, particularly children, must be protected from the views of Holocaust deniers.
Counterpoint:It is true that it would be highly dangerous if Holocaust deniers gained public support. This does not mean it should be banned. Rather, it means that the State has a responsibility to ensure that the public are exposed to the arguments that show that Holocaust deniers are wrong. This is best done through compulsory History teaching about the Holocaust in schools.
