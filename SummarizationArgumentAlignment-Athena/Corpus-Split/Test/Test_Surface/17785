Point:The ethics of private healthcare are not in question here; indeed, the UK government has stated that as many people as possible should be encouraged to pay for private healthcare in order to relieve the strain on national resources[1]. Critics have understood this as the government prolonging waiting lists until the patients ‘remove themselves’ either by going private, or dying[2]. There is, however, a general understanding that the NHS in the UK is overburdened and that increased private healthcare would help to balance this[3]. Meanwhile, in the US, private healthcare is the norm[4]. Allowing the sale of organs is merely an extension of this principle and provides utilitarian benefit. Not only would those who are able to pay for an organ enjoy a much better chance at recovery, but there would be more time, space, and resources for the people who could not afford to do this privately.
Counterpoint:If payment-for-organs is introduced as a general norm, this will extend to the state-financed hospitals which are so burdened in the first place. Few families would turn down the opportunity to receive ‘compensation’ or payment for the families of their loved ones which could ensure financial stability, particularly if the family member who died was the sole or main earner. Therefore, either these families will charge the hospitals the same prices, or they will refuse to donate the organs, and turn to a private market instead. Given that the black market price for organs can reach tens of thousands of pounds[1], it seems unlikely that struggling health systems would be able to afford it, and this would only encourage an incredibly harmful disparity between the wealthiest and the poorest. Unless the proposition case wants to argue that a rich person inherently has a greater right to an organ than a poor person, their point falls.
Point:Legalisation can help to eliminate the corruption currently associated with the organ market. It can also make it easy to regulate, and so safer. Given the mystery of the black market, medical complications are much more likely; it is necessary to match the donor and recipient together[1], but this cannot be easily done when every step of the organ collection and donation must be hidden for fear of prosecution. Legalisation could also stop the ‘theft’ or organs and abuse of people like Chinese prisoners[2] who are currently exploited for their organs[3] – authorities will become accountable to a publicly recognised and enforced system.
Counterpoint:If certain people are already risking punishment by harvesting and transplanting organs illegally, it seems unlikely that they will suddenly become accountable to a system that recognises that organs can be bought and sold arbitrarily. If Chinese officials are already suspected of these activities, it would be very difficult to ensure that profit from the donated organs did go to the donors or their families rather than corrupt authorities. Finally, legalizing an action that is currently carried out in appalling conditions essentially legitimizes appalling human rights violations, and allows human sacrifice.
Point:The proposition is not concerned with live people trying to donate their hearts, or other vital organs which they cannot live without. No matter how impoverished that person might be, they will not choose certain death for a cash payoff. However, organs like kidneys, and sections of liver, can be and often are donated from a live donor without significant lasting damage[1][2]. It is patronising to forbid an individual to sell or donate an organ when it is possible for them to live without it. Similarly, the family of a deceased relative, as next of kin, should have the right to receive financial remuneration from their organs.
Counterpoint:The state often denies individuals the right to do certain things with their bodies. For example, the state makes hard drugs illegal[1][2] because it recognizes that sometimes individuals do not make the best decisions for their health or lifestyle choices, and that the physical damage to their bodies is often lasting and life-changing in ways which that individual did not apprehend. Furthermore, somebody who is selling an organ to try and pay off debts or to relieve financial pressure is unlikely to be thinking entirely rationally; this is an incredibly extreme measure, and allowing individuals to take control over it for a cash reward is a dangerous way to create an incentive to cause bodily harm.
Point:Given that the doctors, nurses and surgeons who work around organ transplants are all paid, it is nonsensical that the donor, the most important figure in the organ transplant, should be left out. The United States already allows markets for sperm[1], blood[2], human eggs[3] and surrogate wombs[4]. There is no good reason why organs should be excluded when these other human products are not; there is no moral difference between a kidney and an ovum. Moreover, organ donation is a lifesaving process, whereas sperm and egg donation are not. Simply put, incentivizing donations through payment will save the lives of many patients in need. The payment from these organs could also hugely improve the quality of life of the donors by lifting them out of debt, or allowing struggling individuals, such as students, to improve their career potential by paying for their university fees.
Counterpoint:It is exactly because organs are potentially life-saving that it would be dangerous to legalize their sale. Sperm and egg donations are a last resort for a couple struggling with infertility[1][2][3]; they have had time to weigh their options. Similarly, when sperm, blood or eggs are donated, they regenerate – kidneys do not. When an organ is the only and final chance for the patient’s recovery, the patient loses rationality and becomes desperate to obtain one[4] – to the point where the donors can essentially name any exploitative price he or she likes. Not only are these individuals then exploited, and the poorer patients left to die, but hospitals will be unable to afford them – so the overall chance of a patient receiving an organ will plummet for the majority without the money to pay for it.
