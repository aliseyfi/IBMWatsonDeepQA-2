Point:Children should receive the same legal protection from violence as adults. It is wrong that parents can deliberately inflict pain to the extent that if inflicted on an adult it would justify prosecution. In a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, children are the most vulnerable members of society, yet the only group which can be legally assaulted. The Council of Europe – which monitors compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights – ruled in 1998 that smacking violated children’s rights against cruel and degrading treatment1 . Furthermore, as Time reports, a hundred years ago ‘it was considered a novel idea for the law to say you couldn’t hit your wife. Today…children are the only class that is unprotected’2. This is not right, ‘children…need more protection and not less’1.It is time to right this wrong.
Counterpoint:We allow children to be treated in a different manner from adults because they need to be educated and are not yet old enough to learn correct behaviour through rational conversation or by an understanding of social norms in the way that adults are able to. We allow adults to restrict their children's movement, finances, eating and even who they socialise with. This is all undeniably acceptable behaviour but it would not be acceptable in the case of adults. The burden on the arguer is to prove that there is some kind of harm to treating children differently to adults. It is also true that physical punishment is sometimes acceptable within the adult community. Society is unlikely to heavily condemn a woman who slaps a man after he has made an excessively degrading comment or who makes her uncomfortable with inappropriate sexual advances. Furthermore, corporal punishment takes place in the context of a loving family environment where no harm is meant and there is mutual care.
Point:The existing mechanisms to catch abusive parents are entrenched in most societies; child abuse claims are often the result of third-party observers, often teachers, calling the police or child services. Such a system would be expected to play a greater role in societies with a ban on smacking – initial penalties would be financial only, to ensure that parents are taken away from their children only if they have proven themselves repeat offenders. This charge would only be if the child is under 12 years of age. Parents who feel that smacking is an appropriate tool of discipline ‘have to give up the privilege to physically discipline their children for the sake of protecting children that aren’t being hit once in a blue moon or in a light way, but are really being hit day after day, many times a day’1.
Counterpoint:The law is ripe for exploitation and is no improvement on the current law in most states that parents can use any form of discipline provided it is not unjustifiable1. How would the state deal with a case where one parent accused another of smacking but without evidence? Smacks do not always leave bruises and children often receive bruises from entirely different activities.
Point:Only an outright ban on smacking will enhance child protection. The number of children reporting being beaten to the point of bruising in Germany has declined from 3 in 10 to 3 in 100 since 1992 after a ban was introduced in Germany. A culture that tolerates smacking makes it easier to conceal graver abuse. Frequently, incidents of abuse reported by children are not investigated, or the cases abandoned as the abuse is written off as a case of "legitimate punishment". A total ban enables child protection workers to give the parents of children at risk of abuse a clear message that no level of corporal punishment is acceptable. A parent who still continues to smack their child would no longer be able to hide behind the defence of "reasonable chastisement". In European countries with a longstanding smacking ban, there has been an increase in the early detection of children at risk, and a decrease in the proportion of parents who are subsequently prosecuted.
Counterpoint:There is nothing to say that the occasionally smacking one's child makes one more comfortable with hurting the child. In fact, it is likely that parents do not enjoy smacking their child and would prefer not to have to but see it as a necessary measure at times. Many parents smack their children and do not abuse them.
Point:Smacking, however occasional, is harmful to children. As well as causing physical pain there are lasting psychological effects. It is widely recognised that smacking undermines children's confidence, weakens their emotional relationships and encourages the use of violence to resolve disputes with siblings and classmates. The experience of childhood smacking has even been linked with an increased risk of alcoholism, depression, masochistic fantasy and suicidal ideation in adult life. Professor Murray Straus tested the IQs of children, spanked and not spanked, and found that the IQs of kids who were not spanked stayed the same over a four year period whilst the spanked toddlers dropped up to 5 points1.
Counterpoint:There is only evidence to support this claim in cases of excessive corporal punishment which is not the type of punishment to which this debate refers. It seems that this argument is very weak in reference to the occasional smack. Furthermore, there is great harm done to children when parents provide too little discipline. A lack of boundaries can leave children feeling neglected and allow them to get themselves into harmful situations and struggle to implement discipline in their adult lives.
Point:The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires the countries to protect children from "all forms of physical and mental violence". The Committee on the Rights of the Child, its international monitoring body for the Convention, emphasises that even physical punishment within the family is not compatible with full implementation, and has formally recommended prohibition to the UK and other countries. In 1999 the European Court of Human Rights found that the beating by a father of his stepson constituted "inhuman or degrading punishment". The law in Britain and other countries that tolerate smacking should be brought into line with European law to ensure the respect of basic human rights.
Counterpoint:All systems of human rights law are qualified. The question of whether the right concerned is engaged at all relies on proving that the act is illegitimate. Further, even if the right is engaged, if it is justified for one of the many reasons written into the structure of the rights themselves it will amount to a legitimate qualification of the right and therefore will not fall foul of the relevant legislation. Finally, European Human Rights law allows a margin of discretion for national laws to take into account cultural differences and the judgment of legislators.
Point:Smacking is harmful to society as normative forms of violence spill over into criminal forms. As corporal punishment is a significant factor in the development of violent behaviour in childhood and later life, an outright ban would help measures to reduce violence and crime. Banning smacking would also help to promote the concept of zero tolerance of violence between all family members and thus reduce all forms of domestic violence, as well as reducing bullying between children. As Sir Al Aynsley-Green, Children's Commissioner in England, has noted, 'we continue to send out confusing messages to parents about the acceptable use of violence across society1. A strong, consistent message needs to be applied, starting with a total ban of smacking.
Counterpoint:The evidence for this is non-existent. There are clear correlations in a society between poverty and violence, availability of weapons and violence, widespread drug use and violence, absence of parents and violence. The assertion of a link between smacking and social violence is highly dubious given the cross-national variation between levels of violence and crime between countries with the same policies on smacking, as well as the strength of correlation with other factors. This is no more than an assertion of hippy faith.
