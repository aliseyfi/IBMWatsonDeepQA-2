Point:The obesity epidemic is taking an enormous toll on global medical costs. In the US alone the health care costs attributable to either direct or indirect consequences of obesity have been estimated at $147bn.[1] Put into context, this amounts to roughly 9% of the health spending in the US.[2]
Counterpoint:An important source of extravagant medical spending around the world, especially in the US, can be traced to inherent inefficiencies of current medical care systems.[1] And the current trends show the situation to be worsening.
Point:A sin tax is a term often used for fees tacked on to popular vices like drinking, gambling and smoking. Its roots have been traced back to the 16th century Vatican, where Pope Leo X taxed licensed prostitutes.[1]
Counterpoint:Choosing to introduce a new policy based on experience with a different, seemingly similar case, is not a good idea.
Point:An important reason why people continuously turn to unhealthy, fat, sugar and salt laden food, is the simple fact that itâ€™s often cheaper than a more wholesome meal comprised at least in part of fresh produce.
Counterpoint:While the tax might level out the playing field, it does so to the detriment of those that would need our protection the most.
