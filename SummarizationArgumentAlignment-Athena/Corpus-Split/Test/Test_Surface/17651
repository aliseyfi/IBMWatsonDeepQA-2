Point:The threat of a direct military attack on the European member states is very remote. As NATO’s new strategic concept acknowledges: “Today, the Euro-Atlantic area is at peace and the threat of a conventional attack against NATO territory is low.”[1]
Counterpoint:Even though the threat of direct military attack is low, there is no guarantee that it will remain so. Armed forces act as an insurance policy against the emergence of a future threat. Once they have been reduced, they cannot be rapidly reconstituted as recruiting and training personnel, and purchasing or manufacturing arms are long term processes. Effective armed forces cannot simply be conjured into existence. Further, the threat of military attack is low because, in part, Europe’s armed forces deter such a threat. NATO’s new strategic concept acknowledges this: “[Peace in Europe] is an historic success for the policies of robust defence, Euro-Atlantic integration and active partnership that have guided NATO for more than half a century.”[1] Reducing Europe’s armed forces would weaken this deterrent.
Point:The commitment to collective defense remains a core purpose of the Alliance. Article 5 of the NATO Treaty specifically states: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”[1] The Treaty goes on to state that NATO states will use the full force necessary to defend against such an attack. This commitment was recently reaffirmed in NATO’s new strategic concept: “NATO members will always assist each other against attack, in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. That commitment remains firm and binding.”[2] Furthermore, NATO has already backed up its words with actions: when Article 5 was invoked on September 12, 2001, following the attacks on New York and Washington, NATO agreed on, and delivered, a package of measures to support the United States.
Counterpoint:European member states cannot assume that NATO will come to their defense if attacked. Article 5 of the NATO Treaty states that the member states “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”[1] – it is not an automatic commitment to military defense. According to Michael A. Goldberg, Editor in Chief of the Boston College International & Comparative Law Review, “after NATO invokes Article Five, each Ally must then consider what assistance it should and will provide;” and, “Allies can provide any form of assistance they deem necessary to respond to the situation”[2]. Relying on NATO is unwise. This is especially true because of NATO’s decision-making structure requires full consensus, which Jay Bergman, professor of Russian history at Central Connecticut State University, describes thus: “if just one member objects, a course of action the remaining 27 members favor cannot be carried out.”[3] Therefore NATO’s European members must still be able to defend themselves, because one dissenting country could unravel their full protection.
Point:If NATO needed to step in to defend Europe, it would be able to call on substantial armed forces. According to Gareth Evans, Chancellor of the Australian National University, NATO has “a formidable war-fighting and peace enforcement capacity, in terms not only of the raw numbers of both personnel (some 2.5 million in uniform) and equipment (over 5,000 helicopters for a start) but also their interoperability, highly professional and integrated military command structure.”[1] Indeed, NATO has shown itself to be effective in the past. Evans again argues, “NATO has demonstrated in more recent years considerable competence in the actual conduct of military operations,”[2] citing the operations in Kosovo in 1999, Bosnia from 1995 to 2004, and Afghanistan since 2001.
Counterpoint:Many of the forces available to NATO are structured and equipped to deal with Cold War threats. They have limited deployability and cannot operate for extended periods away from home. The figures on paper do not give a full picture of NATO’s real capabilities or provide a justification for European Allies to reduce their force levels or spending. Tomas Valasek, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform has noted that “Too much heavy Cold War weaponry remains in place in Europe; it is expensive to maintain and, unless modernised to include up-to-date electronics, nearly useless. EU countries also spend one third of what the Americans spend per soldier: this means that fewer EU servicemen and women get the expensive equipment and training necessary for overseas operations.”[1]
Point:Given that NATO members will defend one another, and that “Three NATO members—the United States, Britain and France - between them deploy more than 10,000 nuclear weapons,”[1] conventional wars are extremely unlikely. As professor Kenneth Waltz argues, “Wars can be fought in the face of deter­rent threats, but the higher the stakes and the closer a country moves toward winning them, the more surely that country invites retaliation and risks its own destruction. States are not likely to run major risks for minor gains.”[2] No likely aggressor is likely to be able to make such gains against Europe as to make the risk of nuclear war worth the risk.
Counterpoint:The problem with nuclear deterrence is that nuclear weapons cause many small wars, a phenomenon known as the stability-instability paradox. Peter Lavoy explains: “mutual fear of big weapons may produce, instead of peace, a spate of smaller wars… states armed with nuclear weapons might bully or attack their non-nuclear neighbors and then use their nuclear arsenals to intimidate foreign powers from intervening.”[1] Indeed this has played out in the history of the nuclear age. Nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction provided the backdrop for Cold War confrontations between the superpowers that occurred through their proxies in theatres like Vietnam and Afghanistan.[2] So even when they have nuclear weapons nations need to keep their troops for conventional wars.
Point:Given that most NATO members have been in a deep recession, and direct military threats to their territories are unlikely, it only makes sense to cut defense expenditure. In the UK, for example, Gaby Hinsliff noted, “As a result of the costs of borrowing through a recession, in five years' time the national debt is forecast to reach £1.3 trillion”[1] – clearly, NATO members have more pressing concerns than keeping up superfluous armies. Currently, Britain spends over 2% of its GDP on defense, and Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox recently admitted that the mission in Libya may cost the UK up to £260 million[2]. With a growing military cost for ammunition, wages and supplies (such as food) NATO members can afford no course of action other than cutting their armed forces costs.
Counterpoint:Spending just 2% of GDP on defense – NATO’s target, which, in fact, very few Allies meet - is historically a very small sum. The European Allies collectively spend only about a third of what the US and Canada spends.[1] This is not enough. Politicians demand more and more of their armed forces – commitments to international operations, support to the civil authorities at home, preparedness to conduct territorial defense operations – and most European armed forces are already suffering from overstretch, i.e. they have insufficient capacity to carry out the tasks placed upon them.
