Point:Antarctica is a pristine and unspoilt continent of great scientific value. In particular, it has a critical impact on the world's environment and ocean systems. Antarctic science has revealed much about the impact of human activity on the natural world. The discovery in 1985 by scientists at British Antarctic Survey (BAS) of the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica revealed the damage done to the Earth's atmosphere by man-made chemicals. This means that it must be left undisturbed, in order to allow further study of such critical international issues as climate change, ozone depletion, long-range weather forecasting and the operation of marine eco-systems (crucial to sustainable fishing). The very placement of mines that produce emissions on the continent may perhaps themselves affect the scientific readings, only by having Antarctica completely undisturbed can we guarantee the level of accuracy we now have.
Counterpoint:While scientific research is important, there may come a time when the need for resources exceeds the need for Antarctica to be left alone. Therefore perhaps we should consider continuing scientific research in Antarctica while also using the resources it has available. As Antarctica is such a large continent, it seems possible that mining for its resources can occur on one side of the continent, while the other half could be maintained for scientific research. The distances between each base would mean that hopefully neither would directly affect the others work too much. Furthermore, as the scientists would be actively working they would be able to notice if any abnormalities were occurring because of the exploitation of resources, and if this was the case could promote discussions between governments, miners and scientists in order to come to a new arrangement.
Point:Opening Antarctica to exploitation would create a serious danger of pollution. This would arise both from oil or other spills and other spoilage that could potentially occur while drilling for resources; the means of transport used to get both workers and machines to Antarctica; and from the increased human presence. This pollution could then lead to disaster for Antarctica and the world in general, as it contributes to global warming. In Antarctica this may lead to the melting of ice caps, the breaking of ice sheets, which results in loss of habitat and food for creatures such as Penguins and Krill. It is believed that over 13,000 square kilometres of Antarctica’s ice has melted in the last 50 years, over the past five years, studies have found that melting Antarctic ice caps contribute at least 15% to the current global sea level rise of 2mm (0.08in) a year. Worldwide, the melting ice can lead to rising sea levels, and an increase in global temperature; In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted the average global sea level would rise by between 11cm (4.3in) and 77cm (30.3in) by 2100. The consequence of this is increased rainfall, increased risk of volcanic eruption, severe risk of flooding (particularly in areas such as Shanghai, Lagos, Texas and North Carolina), problems with farming, increased risk of tropical diseases and an increase in insect life (New Scientist, Natural Resources Defence Council, Cool Antarctica, SCAR, BBC News).
Counterpoint:These concerns are countered by the suggestions that by far the greatest impacts on the Antarctic are external, e.g. the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer over the south pole, global warming, the effects of whaling and pollution on the marine environment. Compared to these global influences, limited exploitation of Antarctic resources under strict environmental regulation will not make a significant difference.
Point:There are many reasons why oil and gas exploration should not be allowed in the Antarctic. Firstly, proven and probable reserves of oil and gas are still rising faster than global consumption, so there is no economic need to exploit any hypothetical Antarctic sources. Furthermore, the economics of exploiting Antarctica’s resources suggest that it would cost far more that current oil reserves. It is estimated by CoolAntarctica.com (2008) that each barrel of oil from Antarctica would cost USD$100, whereas current reserves of oil cost on average USD$77 a barrel. Also, at a practical level, the cost of exploration and production would be completely uneconomic, especially given the hostile climate and the serious iceberg threats to offshore rigs, tankers and pipelines, as well as the very deep continental shelf. The conditions would be even more difficult for more conventional mining onshore where the mining would need to go through the icecap.
Counterpoint:Oil and gas exploration should be allowed, both on the Antarctic continent and in the southern ocean surrounding it. Although current technology would not enable exploitation of any reserves at economic prices, future technological advances and rises in the price of fossil fuels may change this equation. Once, deep water extraction from the hostile North Sea or Arctic Oceans seemed impossible, but now these are taken for granted.
Point:One of Antarctica’s sought after resources are its fish. Antarctica has suffered greatly from overfishing in its past; fur seals, elephant seals, and the great whales were all hunted to the brink of extinction. Now, as many other oceans have already been overfished, fishermen are once again turning to Antarctic waters, particularly for its Krill. Yet overfishing has dangerous consequences, not just for the fish itself; overfishing risks collapsing the fragile ocean ecology all together (National Geographic). One example of this is that if we overfish Krill then there is less food for the humpback whales that feed on krill. This could lead to a reduction in the amount of humpback whales that remain alive, and perhaps even an extinction of the species.
Counterpoint:The Antarctic oceans are under-exploited compared to all other fisheries. Quotas for different species are set very low by scientists sticking to very conservative precautionary principles, and could in most cases be greatly expanded without risk of over-fishing. Indeed, increased catch limits would remove much of the incentive for illegal fishing, and might reduce the pressure on other, less well-protected fisheries elsewhere. If fish stocks are found to be under pressure, then quotas can be reduced once again.
