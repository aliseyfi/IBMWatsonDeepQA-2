Point:Advertising aimed at children brings negative social consequences, as much of it is for food and drinks that are very unhealthy with James Rouse1 stating that in the US over $10 billion is spent annually advertising fast food towards children. Encouraging gullible children to consume so much fatty, sugary and salty food is unethical because it creates obese, unhealthy youngsters, with bad eating habits that will be with them for life. Society also has to pay a high price in terms of the extra medical care such children will eventually require, so the government has a direct interest in preventing advertisements which contribute to this problem.
Counterpoint:Children naturally like foods that are rich in fats, proteins and sugar; they give them the energy they need to play energetically and grow healthily. It is true that eating only such foods is bad for people, but this is a problem of bad parenting rather than the fault of advertising. To suggest that the eating habits, good or bad, stay with children throughout the rest of their lives is ridiculous, when children become adults they will for better or for worse make their own decisions. Also if advertising to children were banned then governments would not be able to use this means of promoting healthy eating, road safety, hygiene, and other socially useful messages.
Point:Advertising specifically to children is unethical because they have little or no money of their own and have to persuade their parents to buy the products for them. Rather than advertising directly to parents, companies use a "nag and whine" campaign that leads to hostility between parents and children. They rely on pester power to make adults spend money they don't have on things they don't want to buy, and which their children may well only play with for a few hours for example. Advertising which presents products to children as "must-have" is also socially divisive, making children whose parents cannot afford them appear inferior, and creating feelings of frustration and inadequacy, as well as leading families into debt.1
Counterpoint:Advertising has no magical power to create unnatural desires for material possessions, Children who persistently nag are simply badly brought up. Poor parenting and undisciplined children cannot be solved by banning advertising, as children have many influences upon them which can stimulate their desires for toys, particularly their friends. It is also untrue that children have no spending power of their own; many children receive pocket money, and teenagers are often able to earn a little themselves. Natasha Smith1 estimates that the average annual amount of pocket money children aged 12-18 are given in the UK is £1,028, which equates to £19.77 a week.
Point:There is a good precedent for banning advertising aimed at children in the restrictions placed in most countries upon advertising tobacco and alcohol. It also takes a stand against increasingly exploitative marketing campaigns that ruthlessly target children. In the USA marketing companies are already offering schools free televisions in exchange for their students being forced to watch a certain amount of programming and advertisements each day, and selling marketing data on those children. It is time that childhood was protected from such commercialization. Such a ban would be limited such as being only preventing advertising aimed at children rather than an outright attempt to stop children from seeing adverts. Companies could therefore still advertise their children's products if they aim their adverts at the parents rather than the children. Alternatively the ban could be preventing advertising at times when children are most likely to be watching the television as has happened in Sweden.1
Counterpoint:Even limited bans are unlikely to be effective and would set a bad precedent which is likely to result in ever more restrictions upon the freedom of expression. Children watch many programmes that adults also enjoy, and some adults are also particularly suggestible; should we then extend this ban to all television advertising. And why stop at television when children are also exposed to radio, cinema, the internet and billboards in the street as well? Perhaps companies should also be banned from sponsoring entertainment and sporting events for children, and prevented from providing free branded resources for schools. On the other hand, any restrictions will be impossible to enforce as television is increasingly broadcast by satellite across national borders and cannot easily be controlled - nor can the internet.
Point:Advertising towards children cannot be considered ethical as children have not yet fully developed their mental cognition. They lack the complete toolset to view advertising critically and advertisers take advantage of this, disregarding any negative effects it may have on children and society more generally.
Counterpoint:Advertisers are subject to strict regulations to ensure that children are not taken advantage at time when they are still developing mental skill-sets. However children live in a commercialized world and should not be entirely shielded from it as without being subjected to some advertising children will never be able to learn fully how to critically engage with advertising. Advertisers recognize that they must be careful in advertising to children so many go above and beyond the standard regulations to ensure that any advertising towards children they do is socially responsible with many companies signing up to self-regulation codes such as the AANA Code for Advertising & Marketing Communications to Children.1
