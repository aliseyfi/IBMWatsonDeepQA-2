Point:A Tobin tax would reduce speculative trading and facilitate real trade and investment. As of 2010, $3.98 trillion dollars changes hands every day on global foreign exchange markets. More than 80% of this trading is buying and selling money for profit’s sake.[1] This speculation has played a crucial role in the current financial crises, as well as those in the 1990s. In a crisis situation, currency trade swiftly increases and dealers often act as a “herd” and cause a rapid economic breakdown. A minimal tax would not hold back productive business transactions for trade and investment, but speculative transactions would be hit harder because the greater the frequency of transactions, the higher the tax charge. In addition, speculation in the international currency markets has had a damaging effect, destabilising the economies of many countries over the years (e.g. Britain 1947-1992, Asia in the economic crisis of the late 1990s, Argentina since 2000). By damping down volatility in the currency markets while raising money for the UN, the Tax would be an ideal solution to problems like this.
Counterpoint:There is little evidence that a global tax would reduce market instability and it would certainly not stop speculative attacks. However, even a small tax on each transaction could be sufficient to reduce liquidity in financial markets and do exactly the opposite - lead to an increase in instability. Because the tax can’t distinguish between speculative activities and dealings to finance trade, all market participants would be subject to the tax. As trade is welfare enhancing, public welfare would be reduced to the extent that trade is reduced. The motivations of different traders in financial markets are not well understood, and there is no way to target only destabilising traders. Currency crises are also a result of a series of factors, including lack of economic reform, levels of debt, inflation and more - not just currency speculation. Therefore, a Tobin tax could not correct structural problems, nor restore Europe’s ailing economies to health, nor prevent speculative trading triggered by political crises.[1]
Point:Most people see financial speculators as an unfortunate part of globalisation; they make money by betting billions on future market changes without any concern for the ordinary people who may be affected by the resulting economic instability. Such speculators can easily afford such a small tax on their deals, and its presence may make them more efficient by forcing them to check that the positions they take are really justified by economic conditions.
Counterpoint:Ordinary people may lose out if such a tax gets in the way of the free working of global currency markets. Many currency deals are carried out by pension funds (on whose profits ordinary people rely for their retirement income), or by companies (in which people may work or own shares) who wish to hedge their future liabilities to safeguard their financial position against shocks. A Tobin tax is of little use in the worst case speculations which usually hit the poorest economies. In the emerging market world of extremely high currency risks, investors who expect a short-term devaluation of as little as 3% or 4% would not be deterred by a low Tobin tax. Indeed, given the scale of recent emerging market devaluations (50% in Thailand and Indonesia, 40% in Brazil), the tax would be totally irrelevant.
Point:The Tobin Tax is an efficient and relatively painless way to raise billions of dollars per year that could easily be used to fund UN aid efforts. The revenue generating potential of the tax is tremendous. A recent study by the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University has showed that a 0.0005% global tax on foreign exchange trades alone could raise up to $26bn per year in aid. Even if we take the smaller amount, this would match existing levels of official aid.[1] The UN and World Bank estimated in 1997 that the cost of wiping out the worst forms of poverty and providing basic environmental protection would be about $225 billion per year. For comparison, the total annual UN budget is about $10 billion. Given the current levels of poverty in the world and the desperate situations that we have seen emerging over and over again in the developing world (e.g. the Asian tsunami, or Kashmiri earthquake), the need for increased funds for aid seems clear.
Counterpoint:While on paper, the tax sounds like the ideal solution, world poverty and currency crises are unlikely to be solved through such a simple idea. Although lack of funds is often given as the main problem in addressing world poverty and humanitarian crises, much writing on development now agrees that the North-South gap will not be narrowed through a mere transfer of funds. These funds often make the receiving countries dependent on outside funding, their economies centred on aid as opposed to industrialization and technological development. Furthermore, too much money set aside for development aid is already lost; Kenya’s finance ministry, for example, estimates that last November it lost $2bn, a third of its budget, to government corruption.[1] In light of this, we cannot assume that rich countries (which would collect most of the tax) would be willing to allocate all this money to international institutions. Industrialised countries may want to keep it for themselves.
