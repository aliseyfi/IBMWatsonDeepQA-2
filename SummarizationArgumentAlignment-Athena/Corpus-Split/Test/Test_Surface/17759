Point:Given that people are already allowed to watch court proceedings from the public gallery – including the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords in the UK[1], and the Supreme Court in the US[2] – there is little reason why this should not be extended to give better access across the nation to anybody who wants to watch. Those with full-time jobs or who live far away from the courts are currently unfairly limited in this respect, and those who do wish to attend well-publicised trials often have to arrive hours in advance to get a seat. Individuals should not have to give up so much time and money just to be able to watch a democratic proceeding, which is a cornerstone of democratic nations. Given that many closed trials such as the trial of the Guantánamo Bay terrorism suspects[3] have still led to intense media coverage, we would be better off showing the courts to be transparent and just instead of vainly trying to hide everything behind closed doors.
Counterpoint:When people take the time and effort to visit the law courts and watch a case, it is a formal, regulated atmosphere. If this were televised, it would become closer to ‘entertainment’ than to fair, legal proceedings. It becomes a human interest story rather than a legitimate court case, where the focus is on moral retribution rather than fair application of the law. Given that high-profile cases can go on for weeks, or even months, even if you were to broadcast every step of the court case it is likely that viewers would only tune in for the climax of the trial. This means that they would miss important (but perhaps comparatively boring) steps which led to that conclusion; it obscures the whole picture of the trial.
Point:It’s difficult for people to have faith in a system which is normally hidden from them. As long as the court proceedings themselves are hidden, the public and the media will continue to judge the judiciary based on unfortunate comments, or comments taken out of context, by judges[1][2]. This means that the legal system becomes distorted and confusing in the public eye. Televising trials would dispel this image by proving the competence, efficiency and sensitivity of most judges in the legal system, and restore faith in it as a whole.
Counterpoint:Video footage of court cases will only serve to increase the ‘soundbite’ culture of the media, where particular quotes or images are taken out of context[1] and emphasised to the detriment of the rest of the trial. Instead of simply being written down in newspapers, this motion would allow them to be relentlessly played back. Televising court cases does not come close to solving this problem. Furthermore, the very reason why unfortunate quotes from judges are repeated and criticised is because society recognises that they are out of keeping with the general respect and intelligence of most judges in the legal system; these individuals are exposed because they break away from the high quality of thought which the judicial system is seen to represent.
Point:If these cameras were introduced, then the public would have something to measure media sensationalism against. Instead of relying on journalistic evidence, the public would be able to literally see for themselves how the judge acted, and how the victim and defendant appeared. In 1981, the case of Chandler vs Florida proved that cameras could operate in courtrooms which ‘did not inherently violate due process’[1] while improving the transparency of courtrooms to the general public. Cameras in the courtroom will prevent the public from being misled about the court proceedings.
Counterpoint:Especially considering recent newspaper scandals such as the News of the World scandal[1], most of the public should already be aware that newspapers are not always reliable, or even that they themselves will break the law to gain their information. Furthermore, it is entirely possible that the judge, victim or defendent might appear differently if they knew that their every move was being watched on national television; what the public might read as nervous guilt on the behalf of the defendant might actually be a kind of stage-fright. They could merely be nervous because an entire county is assessing and judging them before a verdict has ever been reached. This measure does not help the public to see the truth; rather, it encourages them to formulate an opinion before the judge and jury have spoken.
Point:If the defendant is convicted of a crime, they have a right to appeal in the UK[1] and US[2]. However, this is made difficult for another court to re-assess the conviction if they cannot know how reliable evidence was in the first trial. Without film recordings of court trials, judges who have the duty to re-examine the case are unable to see witness testimonies; though new evidence does sometimes come to light during the course of an appeal[3], it would be easier to assess this new evidence if the judges also had knowledge of how the first trial went. If the judges could watch a video of the first trial, they could judge the demeanour, body language and general impression given by each witness in the first trial. Body language can affect a court’s perception of a witness[4], but this information could not be gained by a transcript. However, this evidence may be important for a new verdict to be reached.
Counterpoint:A stenographer already records every word spoken during the course of the trial, which already serves to help with potential appeals[1][2]. Furthermore, appeal court judges rarely interfere with the verdicts of lower courts because they were not present at the original trial. Using a video record to overturn the verdict of a previous court would essentially eradicated the role of a jury; which is to reach a decision based on the fact presented, guided by the judge’s knowledge of the law[3][4]. Far from making court proceedings more democratic and transparent, using cameras in courtrooms would actually be damaging because it undermines the position of normal people to reach a verdict of ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’. In this case, a judge’s choice to hang a new verdict on video information would make the law a very exclusive practice where very few individuals can determine the fates of others, and the role of jury would become irrelevant.
Point:Placing cameras into courtrooms encourages the judiciary and lawyers to increase their efficiency and have high standards of behaviour, because they are aware that it will be carried outside of the courtroom by public viewing. The introductions of cameras to the Houses of Parliament in the UK resulted in significantly improved standards of debate, greater punctuality, and greater attendance of MPs[1]. We can expect this same principle to continue in courtrooms when cameras are put in place.
Counterpoint:Putting this kind of pressure on the judiciary and lawyers does not have the same kinds of benefits that it might in the House of Commons. Politicians often focus on, and are expected to uphold, the general interest of the public, which is why having public access to televised debates is an incentive for them to push those interests through as far as possible. However, the rule of law does not always correlate to public opinion. Particularly in high-profile cases, the public may wish to see the accused given the harshest sentence possible; however, this might not be the legally correct sentence to give in those circumstances. Public outrage has been known to tamper with judicial verdicts in places such as India[1], and is damaging to the principle of a fair trial.
