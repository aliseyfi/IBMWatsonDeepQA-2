Point:We live in a market world. Financial transactions and trade are conducted trans-nationally. Every state is in competition with every other state. This reality has necessitated trade-partnerships, such as NAFTA, and even movements towards social and political union, such as the European Union. The next step is to enfranchise people on a global scale. If many of the trends, transactions and phenomena that affect their lives are global, then people should have a direct say in global decision-making. There would be no better way to ensure this than by creating a Global Parliament.
Counterpoint:There could actually be no worse way to ensuring individual's voices influencing the global decisions. The larger the democracy, the smaller the significance of a single vote. The nation state is the very medium through which the interests of individuals in global matters are transmitted to the rest of the world, and it is the collective power of the state that is the best way of ensuring its citizens wishes are fulfilled, wishes that are necessarily dependent on national context.
Point:The creation of a global parliament would end all wars. The interplay of political life would engender and reinforce an attitude of community and shared goals. Armed conflict is anathema to such a mindset. Just as the history of consensual, shared decision-making via the parliamentary process has virtually removed violence from the menu of political action in Western liberal democracies, so would a practice of parliamentary debate and decision effect such changes on a global scale. This is just the same as how parliaments within states have helped turn those states into nations and created a national consciousness even when uniting disparate peoples as in the United States. It is also being shown to occur internationally with the creation of the European Parliament which is slowly gaining in power.11 http://www.epha.org/a/3894 [3]
Counterpoint:It is utopianism at its absolute worst to dream of perpetual peace being brought about by a World Parliament. It is difficult to see how the power balance of international relations will be altered. States that are big enough and powerful enough will continue to pursue aggressive and oppressive policies in defiance of resolutions demanding them to cease. They will do so because they have the material and military capacity to ignore attempted restraints on their actions. To give two examples, Tibet would not enter this Parliament as a full member but as part of China, Chechnya would still be part of Russia. What dictates whether wars are prevented is realpolitik; action is taken when it is in the interests of those states, which are powerful enough to act. When war can be prevented and it is strategically useful to prevent it then action is taken (the Gulf War). But where action would involve incalculable losses and serves no immediate self-interest (Chechnya and Tibet) it will not be taken. Even today, most wars are civil, intra-state wars.1 It is difficult to see how a world parliament would be better in addressing these than national governments.1http [4]://www.correlatesofwar.org/ (Especially the data set on intra-state war) [4]
Point:Many of the most serious problems in today's world are international, whether they are of an environmental or a political nature. To attempt the solution of these problems through the negotiation of nearly 200 individual sovereign states is futile. Even if any agreement is possible (and agreement is by no means guaranteed) it will be characterized by insufficiency because of compromise between the many different power interests of the separate sovereign states. This has been often exemplified in the case of negotiations involving global interest such as climate change, most recently at Copenhagen in 2010. This Consequently, nation-states should cede sovereignty over very important international issues so that effective action can be taken. World Government should be an ideal towards which we gradually work. The universal problems of human rights and the environment obviously cry out for universal solutions. But gradually, we can foresee other issues such as taxation-policy, education and law and order being decided at international level. The principle behind this is that humans are fundamentally similar. Ethnicity, religion or other cultural considerations can add variety and spice to daily life but they should not be obstacles to the recognition of globally shared interests and, consequently, to the introduction of global decision making.
Counterpoint:This argument does not advocate for global government, but global governance, the key difference being that global government requires the amalgamation of nation states into one world state, while global governance advocates cooperation based on shared values.The issue of human rights is indeed universal. To that end, intergovernmental cooperation has secured the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and numerous subsequent conventions. There are many intergovernmental conferences on human rights and other global issues such as the environment. And where agreements are not reached, or are not satisfactory, this reflects the genuine difference of interest and opinion amongst the different nation-states; it would be wrong, if not impossible for a global government to impose a single policy in these circumstances.
Point:Calls for world government in the post-World War II era implied a deep suspicion about the sovereign state's potential as a vehicle for moral progress in world politics. Emery Reves' influential The Anatomy of Peace is a condemnation of the nation-state as a political institution: "The modern Bastille is the nation-state, no matter whether the jailers are conservative, liberal or socialist". Echoing Rousseau, Reves argued that nation-states threaten human peace, justice and freedom, by diverting funds from important needs, prolonging a global climate of mistrust and fear, and creating a war machine that ultimately precipitates actual war. The experience of the world wars thus made it especially difficult to view states as agents of moral progress1.1 http://www.archive.org/details/anatomyofpeace009815mbp [8]
Counterpoint:Conflict and interest groups cannot be eradicated by eliminating the nation state. Different interests will still exist, and without the buffer that international politics provides, they might prove even more difficult to consolidate into a decision. The world state is at even a greater risk of war between those interest groups as they will not have the release valve that is the state to regulate the expression of their interests.
