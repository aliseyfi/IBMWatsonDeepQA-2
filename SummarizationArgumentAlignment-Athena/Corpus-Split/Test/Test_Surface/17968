Point:A Master’s degree helps candidates stand out from the crowd – especially in professions where a first degree is commonplace. As well as demonstrating greater knowledge, research Master’s in particular, show that the candidate has the ability to motivate themselves and deliver a project largely under their own supervision.
Counterpoint:It is ridiculously tautological to say that “you need a Master’s degree for those jobs where you need a Master’s degree”, which is prop’s supplemental argument.
Point:A Master’s degree increases knowledge- both in terms of quantity and quality- as it allows for a more refined study of the field.
Counterpoint:This statistic is deeply unhelpful and, frankly, irrelevant to the debate. By definition the category of ‘those with Master’s degrees’ by definition includes high paying professions for which further study is essential such as medicine, law and MBA grads in the higher levels of business.
Point:Life is not entirely about the world of work, and society as a whole benefits from a more educated citizenry. Equally, a Master’s degree provides benefits to the individual in terms of a deeper understanding of both their subject and the world around them[i].
Counterpoint:Many of the non-vocational benefits that are ascribed to advanced education have vastly more to do with the sort of person likely to undertake post-graduate study than they have with the qualification itself. The background, class and professional ambitions of Master’s students are far stronger indicators of the value that they will derive from a course of study than the content of the Master’s degree itself.
