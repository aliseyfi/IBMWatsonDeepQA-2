Point:There is a perfectly reasonable case that the state should pay. The wealth now enjoyed by the USA, for example, stems in part from the use of slaves. Its development wouldn't have been as fast, its GDP would not be so high, it would not have so much money if it weren't for slaves. Some of it should be paid back. If links can be established to corporations, then those corporations should pay. Pointing to the fact that individuals alive today didn't keep slaves is simplistic - they have benefited from living in an enviromnent whose wealth was built on the backs of slaves.
Counterpoint:Firstly, simply because current individuals are benefitting from the previous harms doesn’t mean that they are responsible for them, they are just feeling its aftermath. There is no link between the two – they did not commit these atrocities, even if it has helped the nation they live in. Secondly, the proposition points out that identified corporations ought pay, but many individuals and corporations benefited from slave ownership, and the wealth it generated has trickled down into investments, bank accounts and business funds today. But why should the state or corporations pay, when the primary benefit was to individuals?
Point:This money would be more symbolic – and that symbolism could be the means for beginning the restoration of the fortunes of a minority that has been long oppressed. This isn’t about victimhood or singling out a particular minority for special charitable treatment – this is money owed, and money people are entitled to. It is not the causing of a division, but rather the healing of a still-open wound. That supposed symbol of freedom and liberty, the US Capitol building was constructed by slaves.[1] African-Americans cannot truly feel part of the free society and democracy in which they live until this wrong is publicly admitted and righted.
Counterpoint:It is divisive to push an agenda that suggests that African Americans are still so different that they can and should be singled out. Why encourage those that weren't born at the time of slavery to see themselves as victims in a society that actually offers them huge opportunities? We should be looking beyond race. We should forgive and forget. This discussion drags us back to old problems, opens old wounds, and makes racial divisions and tensions more likely.
Point:Slaves were entitled to compensation and, being deceased, that money should go to their descendants. This principle doesn't cease to be true over time – truth and justice don’t have sell-by dates. The most important thing to establish is the principle of reparation being right. The how is less important. A reasonable approach would be to say that individuals would have to establish a direct link between themselves and a slave (many can). The fact that doing so will be difficult does not mean that it should not happen. Dwelling on the practical difficulties is no real opposition. Practicalities come second: the focus should be on righting this wrong.
Counterpoint:Simply because one's ancestor was entitled to payment does not mean their descendants are due that money, similar to how if one's ancestor committed a crime one is not held accountable. No wrong has been taken against the descendants of the slaves, only the slaves themselves.
