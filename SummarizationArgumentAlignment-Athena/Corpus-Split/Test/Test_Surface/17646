Point:Denying rogue states weapons is the most effective way of preventing them from posing a threat to other states or their own people. The UN, rather than individual member states, should regulate the arms trade and, in particular, restrict arms sales to rogue states. All major arms exporting countries claim they already regulate arms exports tightly (typically by a system of licensing) in order to ensure that arms do not end up in undesirable hands. However, the United States, for example, was one of the principal suppliers of arms to Indonesia under Suharto, providing training aircraft, radar equipment, spare parts and machine guns. In contrast, the UN can set up an international convention or treaty in order to prevent countries selling arms to rogue states. As has been demonstrated by the Kyoto Protocol, the UN can enforce a change in a national government's behaviour even if it has not signed up to the treaty itself. This would be an effective way to police arms trade, as the UN Security Council would act as the authorizing body. In this way, unlike national governments, the UN would provide the correct check and balances to regulate the arms trade in an impartial and legal way. A practical solution is forthcoming; the Arms Trade Treaty, initially put forward in 2003 by a group of Nobel peace laureates, has been voted in favour by 153 member states and is currently being negotiated.1 Since the inauguration of Barack Obama, the new American administration is also now in favour of the treaty.
Counterpoint:It is extremely unfortunate when a state to which arms have been sold later becomes rogue and misuses those arms, but the proposition's proposal will do nothing to prevent it. The UN is unable to place blocks on the export of small arms and, even if it did, such small-scale policies will do nothing to stop war. The small, cheap weapons that the proposition talks about are usually made and sold illegally. Attempts by national governments are currently afoot to stamp out that trade. An additional order from the UN would hardly make any difference. Furthermore, when UN member states voted for The Arms Trade Treaty, the George Bush administration voted against the proposal. As the US trades more arms than any other country, the treaty is worthless without American backing. Although the Obama government has expressed agreement with the treaty's aims, the National Rifle Association and the American people are still sceptical, as they view UN intervention as an attempt to circumvent the second amendment in order to impose domestic gun regulations.
Point:The arms trade is a global problem which, by definition, crosses national borders and continental boundaries. To soften its impact will require more than just the piecemeal action of isolated governments. Broad international co-operation is necessary and as such the UN is the ideal forum to pursue an end to arms sales to rogue nations. Because of its global membership the UN is the only forum which can bring together the required global coalition. Furthermore, national governments are notoriously bad at obeying their own rules on the arms trade. In order to secure lucrative contracts, national governments regularly bend their rules to permit the export of arms to rogue states. Russia and the Ukraine, for example, were supplying weapons (including anti-tank missiles) to Iraq right up until the second Gulf War.1 Since national governments are unlikely to make ending the arms trade to rogue nations a long term priority, UN regulation is required. Unlike any national government, the UN is able to take the long view and end this appalling trade. Practically, the UN Security Council currently has the power to impose an arms embargo
Counterpoint:The proposition's view that the UN is a truly global forum capable of marshalling enough support to restrict arms sales to rogue states is at odds with reality. Given that member states set the agenda for the UN, the commitment to control the arms trade must ultimately come from within member states themselves. It cannot be successfully imposed from above precisely because, as the proposition point out, national governments do have a vested interest in maintaining regulatory control over the arms trade. This matters since it is the member states that will have to enforce any restrictions. The UN itself has no mechanism for ensuring that its rules are enforced. Furthermore, were the UN to try to restrict the arms trade and fail, this failure would damage the UN by discrediting it further. At a time when the UN is attacked for being incompetent (following its failures over the Iraq War, the Oil for Food programme and the Asian Tsunami relief operation1) it would be foolhardy for it to undertake a project that is doomed to failure. In practice, the UN's ability to impose arms embargoes has been used inconsistently. Recently, for example, the UN maintain that it was both legal, under UN Security Council Resolution 1973, and illegal, under UN Security Council Resolution 1970, to supply arms to Libyan rebels in the Arab Spring.2
Point:The arms trade is one of the principal sources of poverty in the world, as states spend limited resources paying for arms rather than improving the welfare of their people. This problem is particularly severe with rogue states, which typically have more enemies (both inside and outside their borders) and place less of a priority on welfare. In fact, the developing world spends about $20 billion a year on arms.1 And of course the cost of conflict is much higher. Given that a fundamental part of the UN's mission is to improve the lives of ordinary people, it is right that it should make ending the arms trade to rogue states a priority.
Counterpoint:Campaigners may want to believe that the arms trade is a major cause of poverty in rogue states, but the reality is that arms sales to rogue states are highly limited at the moment, and the amounts of money involved are small on the scale of a government's budget. The major causes of poverty are bad government and debt. The $20 billion spent on arms each year by developing countries may seem a considerable sum but (apart from the fact that only a fraction of this is spent by rogue states) it is dwarfed in comparison to the size of debt owed by developing countries: $550 billion.1 Claiming that the arms trade causes poverty merely diverts attention from the real problems.
Point:Rogue states, by definition, refuse to be bound by international norms and threaten the stability of their region or even the world as a whole. By and large, rogue states are less developed countries lacking the capability to produce sophisticated weapons or even basic arms in large numbers. Trade with more developed nations is therefore their only route to acquiring a significant military capacity. The trade in small arms, in particular, is generally regarded as being a root cause of many of the conflicts in Africa, which have brought death and poverty to millions. Given that an AK47 can be bought for as little as $6 in some countries, it is no surprise that the civil war in Sudan lasted 21 years and cost almost 2 million lives.1 Furthermore, a rogue nation may use arms against its own population. Typically rogue states have poor human rights records and are willing to commit atrocities against their own citizens. Supplying them with arms gives rogue states the tools to do the job. Saddam Hussein, for example, used Soviet and western-made arms in his slaughter of the Kurds in 1991.2 Similarly, US M16 machine guns were used to slaughter peaceful demonstrators in East Timor in 1991.3 In light of this, it is vital that the UN takes a lead in stamping out arms sales to rogue nations
Counterpoint:Many of the weapons which rogue states have used to threaten their neighbours or oppress their own people were sold to them before they were regarded as rogue states. For example, the weapons which Iraq used to invade Kuwait (and which were subsequently used against allied forces and the Kurds) were sold to Iraq before Saddam Hussein was considered a threat to international peace and security. Looking back, that judgement was very wrong but it demonstrates that the proposition's proposal would have done nothing to prevent Saddam getting hold of arms. The fact is that very few arms are sold to rogue states at the moment. The Federation of American Scientists claims that eight states to which the US currently supplies arms are troubling: Brazil, Columbia, India, Indonesia, Israel, Pakistan, Philippines, Turkey.1 None of those states is widely regarded as rogue. Furthermore, wars are not caused by the existence of cheap arms. The African wars that the proposition refers to are usually a result of ethnic divisions. Even if the availability of sophisticated weapons were reduced, the wars would still be fought, and just as brutally, with whatever arms were available.
