Point:The philosopher Peter Singer proposes what has been called the Greater Moral Evil Rule: If we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable significance, we ought to do it. From this first premise Singer argues that absolute poverty is bad and that there is some absolute poverty we can prevent without sacrificing anything of comparable significance. Therefore, we ought to prevent some absolute poverty. This argument can be modified to cover a large variety of things which one might call 'charity'.
Counterpoint:As much as Singer wants us to give. Giving away a huge portion of one's money seems require heroic self-sacrifice. It is also different in that we do not always know whether or not our money will contribute to saving a life. Maybe it will pay for administration or be wasted or fill the pockets of bureaucrats. It is far more callous to kill someone who you can see suffering and who is in your presence. We cannot expect people to have empathy for every human alive. We should only hold people responsible for problems that they helped to cause. Wealthy people did not help to cause poverty and so can't be held responsible for solving it.
Point:Many people gain from giving to charity. It improves self-esteem, alleviates guilt, and ensures religious or cultural guidelines that are important to you are met. They also contribute towards tax breaks. Acting in such an ethical manner therefore has numerous effects on other aspects of life. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has given billions to his own charities, describes giving his money back as making him feel 'very fortunate' and 'thrilled'1.
Counterpoint:There are numerous ways people can feel better about themselves without having to give up money to a charity. Whilst one could give money to a charity that provides support to the poor and disadvantaged, he or she could just as easily use their wealth to start a business or expand a current one, providing jobs that will do a great deal more for the jobless than a package from a charity. Furthermore, the knowledge that one's business has given a job to someone poor and in desperate need of work will do far more for their self-esteem than signing a cheque to a charity. Similarly, sending a cheque when one could, with a bit more effort or courage, create a job would only increase guilt rather than alleviate it.
Point:The wealth gap is strongly correlated to crime. In order to make one's own society safer one ought to give generously to charities that support the poor. In the United States in 2008, 37% of black high-school dropouts were incarcerated; if more money was given to charities that support the poor sectors of society that are the most likely to drop-out, crime rates would inevitably come down. For example, of those black students who did make it to college, only 2% were incarcerated. The pattern is uniform across all races in the United States, the longer they stay in school, and therefore the more chance they have of finding a job, the less chance of ending up in prison1.
Counterpoint:Giving aid to foreign countries does not decrease the wealth gap, nor does caring for the elderly. One cannot singlehandedly reduce the wealth gap by sending money to improve the conditions in an orphanage. One is more likely to reduce the wealth gap by developing the company in which one works so that more workers can be employed and paid higher wages. It is not necessarily the case that by behaving charitably you are likely to receive charity in the future. People are selfish and we do not live in small villages any longer where there is a higher degree of reciprocity. People tend to fall on hard times when there is a widespread economic recession in which case people are highly unlikely to behave charitably.
Point:While we live in a materialist culture where it is often felt necessary to gather more and more stuff, often disposing of other items as we go along it is also very easy to give. There are thousands of charities that allow us to give to the needy either in terms of giving cash or our time and skills. These charities do work in all sorts of activities, from debate education like the international debate education association, to feeding the starving like Oxfam. In many cases we can give in local stores as well as online or by post. Those in the rich world also have lots of disposable income that they can give away. Toby Ord, a university researcher shows that it is possible to give away a lot to charity while not on an income that is particularly large by the standards of the developed world. He gives away over a third of his income of £25000 and still has plenty to live on. Ord believes that everyone in the rich world should give away a tenth of their earnings1.
Counterpoint:It is not easy to reject the whole of materialist culture in order to give large amounts of one's income away to charity. Ord is notable and came up in the BBC magazine precisely because it is so unusual for someone to be willing to give so much away. Many people on £25,000 are using up almost all their money on living expenses, especially if they are looking after elderly relatives or bringing up children.
