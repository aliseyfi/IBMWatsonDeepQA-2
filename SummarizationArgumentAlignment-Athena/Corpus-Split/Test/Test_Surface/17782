Point:Only intent, not the word “nigger”, can be racist. The word “nigger” is not racist. A word can never be racist, the only way a word is racist if it is used with racist intent and explained that way. There are other words besides "nigger" that is just as offensive because of the connotation, like “eggplant”. The word by itself has no meaning; the history of the word and the situations in which the word is used brings the word to life. The term is both endearing and disrespectful depending on the situation in which it used. For example I can say "You're my nigga!" and it's reviewed as positive or I can say "You're a nigga," and it can be seen as negative. The common debate about this word doesn't exist so much with how to use it, but more so who uses it.
Counterpoint:Regardless of intent, the N-word still carries extremely negative connotations with America’s dark past. Many African-Americans see the word as dehumanising given the mailicious context it was commonly used in during the Post-Reconstruction era. To use the word now, even in a humourous, endearing context would be to at best, disregard the suffering of the past which is evoked by the word, or worse make something as grave as the abuses suffered into a figure for fun. Either way it is best if the word is not used by anyone to avoid such risk of offence.[1]
Point:Meaning of words shifts over time; "nigger" has softened. There was a time when the word "black" was offensive when describing African-Americans. The word "black" was used to define everything in a negative way, African Americans preferred to be called "Negro" or "Colored" in the late 1800s and most of the 1900s. It wasn't until figures like Stokely Carmichael, Adam Clayton Powell, Malcolm X, Huey P. Newton, James Brown, Syl Johnson, Tommie Smith and John Carlos began to endorse "Black Power" and "Black is Beautiful" did African Americans associate themselves with black as a signal of positivity.[1] Prior to the Black Panther era, black was just as negative as nigger. The fact that the word has been switched from negative to positive, shows that language can be manipulated and changes with the time.[2]
Counterpoint:The use of the word ‘black’ was bound to shift as Americans grew more enlightened in the Post-Civil Rights era. Black is the word of a colour and its usage in terms of one’s race is intentioned as a description of appearance, in the same way that ‘white’ is the name of a colour used to describe the racial appearance of Caucasians. The N-Word on the other hand was a bastardisation of a legitimate Spanish word to create a demeaning insult.[1] It is unnatural unlike the word ‘black’ and thus should not be attempted to be treated as such.
Point:A dangerous double standard has emerged over the use of the word "Nigger". It is acceptable depending on who uses it. A black person can say it and it can be endearing, but if an outside race uses it, it is automatically racist. Difficulties can arise from its use being misinterpreted purely on the race of the person using it. Surely it is best for all if such an anomaly is removed by making it acceptable for all people to use the word within the changing context highlighted earlier in the debate. If this happens, then accusations of ‘preferential treatment’ towards African-Americans with regard to the use of words can no longer be used as a pretext for barely disguised prejudice which is still prevalent in society.
Counterpoint:The controversy over whether it is acceptable for non-blacks to use the word clearly underlines why the word should not be used in civilised conversation. The N-word still evokes painful reminders of the suffering of black Americans at the hands of oppressive whites, thus creating the automatic assumption of malice when a white person uses it, regardless of context. Surely it is best for the purposes of clarity and understanding between the races that all people are prevented from using the N-word.
