Point:There are very difficult issues involved here; students will not easily understand whether the prohibition on killing applies to the death penalty, wars, assisted suicide, and a number of other very sensitive public policies subject to intense debate.1 Likewise, the prohibition against adultery could be interpreted as not banning pre-marital relations, non-coital sexual behaviour, and other actions the state may not in fact wish to endorse.2
Counterpoint:Rarely is there a moral issue that does not require a nuanced explanation in some situations. There is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater, however. The Ten Commandments form a good baseline from which children can learn, and then, as they become older, issues like the death penalty or just wars can be explained to them in more depth. Even if these are not absolute guidelines, they can still be useful simplifications. Just as we teach children calculus or other advanced mathematics only after we have taught them division and multiplication, we can build their moral knowledge starting with "thou shall not kill" and then later explain more complicated ethical exceptions.
Point:Public schools are run by the government and as such have an obligation to cleave to that principle of separation of church and state. It is against the Ten Commandments to believe in "other gods", but we expressly permit belief in other religious systems and atheism via constitutional protections. Not only is this a violation of the principle of separation, but it also sends a mixed message to those groups, and runs the risk of alienating those who do not conform to these ideals.1 Posting the Decalogue is obviously tremendously divisive - a serious culture war of lawsuits, protests, and speech has been waged over the issue. Unless schools were to post texts for literally every religion and atheism as well, this goal cannot be achieved if the Ten Commandments are in the classroom.2 Neutrality is the best antidote to contemporary culture wars.3
Counterpoint:This practice of posting the Commandments largely exists in conservative communities which wholeheartedly embrace religion and the message of the Ten Commandments. By and large, only outsiders tend to question core aspects of the culture in the school districts that post the Decalogue.1 While minority rights need to be respected, we should not structure the rules of society such that the urge of the majority to express something that is fundamental to them – religious belief – is consistently suppressed because of a few naysayers or legal organizations who do not understand the norms. They can go elsewhere, to communities that share their religious views or lack thereof.
Point:The text is often translated differently from the original Hebrew, reflecting variances in intent on the part of different sects, such as Protestants, Jews, and Catholics. This is a profoundly sensitive issue and any perceived favouritism on the part of the government would simply result in a greater backlash. Better to sidestep this problem altogether and have a blanket policy against posting the Decalogue.
Counterpoint:The case Chambers v. Marsh upheld the ability to have a chaplain give prayers before legislative sessions, and that was not at all doomed by the fact that a particular denomination of chaplain had to be picked. Posting of any version of the Commandments would just serve to reinforce the same basic message that our government derives some authority from God.1
Point:Our legislators must be conscious of the dangers of wrapping the Ten Commandments in the flag and indicating that one faith or religious set of laws is more patriotic or representative of the nation's fundamental values than another.1 That idea can easily be used as a weapon against a minority's group rights as well as their sense of belonging to the country. Regardless of the role they may have played at the founding, our current society is an extraordinarily multicultural one, composed of a variety of religious minorities, including Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The world has seen a tremendous rise in Islamic extremism as well as in conservative xenophobic reactions to it (for instance, the 2011 Breivik attacks in Norway), and to prevent such things from happening, our children need to know how to live together peacefully and value all backgrounds.
Counterpoint:There isn't anything wrong with displaying or teaching the historical foundations of the country, even if we have expanded beyond that original vision since then. In fact, maintaining that heritage and our connections to it is very important if we are to remember who we are as a people. The courts have ruled that the legislature is allowed to have a chaplain lead prayers before legislative sessions because it represents a tradition dating back to the very first meetings of the legislature in the country.1 Such practices are reasonable ways to honour our past. Extremism is certainly a scourge to the world, but it is often perpetrated by psychologically disturbed or unbalanced individuals; more "political correctness" in schools will not make a meaningful difference. Following such traditions will not prevent teaching to respect all faiths.
