Point:A pupil is unable to give or withhold their consent to participating in school prayer. This is because the school environment does not facilitate the free exercise of consent. It mandates attendance, it is delivered in an inherently instructional facility, and its subjects are immature, having underdeveloped faculties of resistance and consent, and being subject to the pressure of their peers. The Supreme Court in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe recognised the significance of social influence upon pupils exerted by colleagues and staff, and that in any school environment, a prayer will be seen as an approved action by the school which is unconstitutional[1]. A pupil does not opt into the practice of prayer - the practice typically takes place in the context of an assembly at which attendance is compulsory. The consent of the pupil to the prayer is therefore not sought but merely presumed.
Counterpoint:The provision of formal prayer does not invalidate the consent of the child concerned. Should a child or parent of guardian object to the practice of prayer, the child is entitled to refrain from participation. Pupils consistently exercise their consent in their education, from the curricular and extra-curricular options chosen, to the dress worn, to the food eaten. No one ought to defend a school curriculum or staff member that is considered to manipulate the consent of the child concerned. However, there is nothing inherent in the school environment that impairs the consent of a child to prayer. A child might of course feel a small and perhaps significant degree of social isolation from not participating in the prayer. Nevertheless, this sentiment is the necessary price of
Point:Religious discrimination is completely unacceptable and should certainly not be condoned or even facilitated by a school. Yet, in order to be meaningful, a prayer must also be discriminatory between different religious beliefs. The imprecation of one deity (as opposed to another or several others), the choice of language and the supplication sought are distinctive to each faith. The incorporation of any or all such addresses into a single prayer at best confuses its meaning, and at worst renders it meaningless[1]. Where the practical precatory choice is between discrimination and equivocation no school prayer should be permitted.
Counterpoint:Non-denominational prayer preserves an equilibrium between different faiths - by being non-specific it allows the individual to impose their own beliefs on what is being said. It can even offer a valuable moment of reflection for the atheist. Moreover, the prohibition of school prayer does in fact amount to religious discrimination. The practice simply prefers the atheist, who does not adhere to formal religious worship, to the followers of any religious faith.
Point:The Court in Pierce v. Society of Sisters and Wisconsin v. Yoder recognised that the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing of children under their control extends to the religious faith that is imparted to the children[1]. The proper purpose of schooling is not indoctrination. Should religion be considered a valuable part of a balanced curriculum, it ought to be taught in a broad and critical context in the classroom. A formal prayer instills obedience to a faith that the child might neither understand nor accept and to which the parent or guardian might properly object. The practice does not stimulate discussion or debate and therefore has no place in schools.
Counterpoint:The guidance of parents or guardians is wholly compatible with the formal school prayer. First, the primary caregiver of the child can simply direct the child not to attend the prayer, in the alternative or in addition to requesting the school not to permit the child to participate in this activity. Second, the proposition argument tends heavily towards the hysterical. An American public high school does not typically embrace the Jesuit aphorism of taking a child and building a believer for life[1]. A brief prayer, perhaps even conveying a nondenominational message, is exceedingly unlikely to confuse a child or damage the teaching of the parents or guardians. Third, a school necessarily and properly stands in loco parentis of its pupils. It is entirely proper that, in the absence of expression to the contrary on behalf of the parent or guardian, the school should make the deliberately paternalistic choice to hold a school prayer for the pupils. Fourth, if a court or legislator could ever be so presumptuous as to tender a definition of the ‘purpose’ of schooling, it should reasonably include the spiritual development of its subjects. A moment of prayer or reflection is consequently a valuable and not supererogatory element of the curriculum.
Point:If regulations were to change and prayers allowed based upon the expressed desires of students and parents, it would be almost impossible to ensure that each individual was receiving what they or their parents would consider the “proper” exposure to faith or religion. Not only would it be logistically difficult and disruptive to allow students not to attend public prayers, it would also be very difficult to ensure that this was being done. Only by ensuring that it is not allowed can this problem be solved – that way those who do want to pray are of course still able to do so and those who do not want to be a part of it or whose parents don't wish them to be involved may not be forced into doing so. Evidence for this can actually be seen from an attempt to ensure that schools carry out prayer in Wales where it is a legal obligation. The School Standards and Framework Act (1998) set out that every pupil “shall on each school day take part in an act of collective worship.”[1] A BBC survey showed in fact that less than half of the schools inspected carried out this obligation[2] - and equally if schools in America were permitted to conduct prayer, the level of continuity and the monitoring of whether or not the rights of the children under the constitution were being breached would be an impossible task.
Counterpoint:It would surely be no less of a task than checking to see that prayers are not carried out at all. If they were allowed, individuals would be able to make their own choice as to participate and there would be no need for the government to get involved and waste money over the issue. If anything this simply shows that a blanket policy in either direction is unsustainable, and that allowing individual states and school districts to make their own decisions is the best way to ensure that people get what they want from their time at school.
