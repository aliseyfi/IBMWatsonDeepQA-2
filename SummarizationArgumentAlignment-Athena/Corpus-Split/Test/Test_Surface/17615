Point:International adoption provides orphans, often living in decrepit, under-funded and unhygienic environments, a loving home in a developed society. Child welfare experts appreciate that keeping infants in institutional care for extended periods of time puts them at risk of lifelong damage1. Adopting parents are proven to be both financially and emotionally capable of both adopting and raising the child, ensuring that the emotional heartache of growing up in an orphanage is replaced by the stability of a home environment. This is advantageous, for obvious reasons, for both child and parent, whilst the state from which the child is adopted is relieved of the financial pressure of supporting the orphans and the mother of the orphan can reassure herself that her child is being well looked-after. As a Korean government official notes regarding the high adoption rate of Korean children in the United States, 'in the beginning, the only reason foreign adoptions were allowed was that it was so difficult to raise children after the Korean War'2. In times of both financial austerity and societal breakdown, international adoption is a welcome relief, most of all to the unwanted children provided with a loving home and parental attention.1 Bartholet, E. International Adoption: The Human Rights Position. Global Policy, 2010, p912 Chira, S. Babies for Export: And Now the Painful Questions. New York Times 21 April 1998 [2]
Counterpoint:The proliferation of international adoption encourages parents to alleviate themselves of the responsibility of raising a child, increasing the number of children in institutional care. Parents, for less than admirable reasons, are increasingly giving their children up owing to the interest in international adoption. A study has shown that "the vast majority (96%) of European children in so-called 'orphanages' are not true orphans and have at least one parent, often known to the child welfare authorities"1. Furthermore, the ostensible goal of international adoption to reduce the number of unwanted children does not correlate with the facts. Results from a survey of European Union states in 2008 show that 'countries with high proportions of outgoing international adoptions also had high numbers of young children in institutional care'1. Therefore, far from the positive effects on the adopted children, international adoption only encourages the removal of children from home environments and increases the number in institutions.1 Chou, S., & Browne, K. The relationship between instititutional care and the international adoption of chidren in Europe. Adoption and Fostering, 2008, pp.41-42
Point:Couples who have made the decision to adopt a child should not be restricted in their choice to their country of residence. It may be in the state's interest to reduce the number of children in their own institutions, however there is no reason citizens should be straddled with this obligation. We do not prevent our adults from marrying foreign nationals and granting them citizenship; why would we do so for children? Furthermore, if the conditions of the couples' state's institutions are fairly good, they have a strong altruistic motive to adopt from a nation which does not fund its own institutions similarly. Unwanted or orphaned children living in squalid conditions in the developing world should be the priority for couples seeking to adopt, not those living in the local orphanage who, whilst hoping for a permanent home, will not starve. International adoption therefore would provide a small but tangible means of reducing the infant mortality of many of these struggling states.
Counterpoint:Couples seeking to adopt must be restricted to their country of residence in order to prevent the establishment of a market for children needing adoption and the undermining of the immigration system. Most fundamentally however, a citizen is tied not merely to the state but to their other citizens, and they do have an obligation when they seek to adopt to help those children, their fellow citizens, who have yet to find a permanent, loving home and family. Furthermore, if couples seeking to adopt would do so wherever they were needed most, it would encourage developing world states to reduce expenditure in their own child welfare programmes in the knowledge that the developed world would bail them out. Finally, the granting of citizenship to foreign children would undermine the caps of immigration and punish those who have waited patiently for long stretches of time to be permitted to enter the country, work legally and establish their own families.
Point:Humanitarian crises that lead to a surplus of unwanted or orphaned children can create a groundswell of sympathy which drives parents to wish to adopt internationally. In China, where the one-child policy created unprecedented numbers of girls to adopt, 14,500 were adopted in 20051. However, this number paled in comparison to the clients who were waiting in line hoping to provide a home in an environment where girls were not valued less than their male counterparts1. Furthermore, the effects of wartime also act as instigators for international attention, driving adoption to offset the barbarous effects of the conflict itself. As a report into the adoption of Korean children notes, 'orphans of the Korean and Vietnam war, especially children fathered by American soldiers, were given special humanitarian attention'2. Without international adoption, the likelihood of such children escaping a life in an institution is remote.1 Graff, E. J. The Lie We Love. Foreign Policy, December 2008: [5]2 Kim, W. J. International Adoption: A case review of Korean children. Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 1995, p.141.
Counterpoint:Humanitarian crises which ostensibly drive well-meaning parents to adopt internationally are a myth. The actual supply of children is ultimately driven by demand and corruption; as demand rises for adoption, so too does the price of the process as traffickers are drawn to the money that can be made. As Alexandra Yuster, a senior advisor on child protection with UNICEF, notes, 'it's not really true that there are large numbers of infants with no homes who either will be in institutions or who need inter-country adoption'1. The attentions of those in the developing world should not be to adopt these children, but to encourage the states in which they live to invest in child welfare programs or to initiate aid programs to provide it for them. The proliferation of international adoption serves little other than the greed of traffickers and adoption agencies cashing in on inflated statistics of orphan well-being.1 Graff, E. J. The Lie We Love. Foreign Policy, December 2008 [5]
Point:Many parents who desperately want children do not fit the socio-economic requirements to adopt in their own country. Western adoption laws are very difficult to pass through; even though anyone fertile can have naturally born children. Those looking to adopt have to face stringent scrutiny. For example those making less than or equal to 20,000 U.S.D annually have difficulty adopting as they qualify as living below poverty level in the U.S whereas in third/fourth-world countries that same amount qualifies as a decent income1. Furthermore, mothers allowing others to adopt their child are far more likely to pick young couples than older couples who have outlasted their body clock in the search for a child2. Therefore, whilst your local government would argue you have insufficient resources to adopt, you are still able to provide for a child a more comfortable environment than that of an orphanage in his home country.1 Clark, S., Income Requirements for Domestic Adoption. eHow 2 February 2011: [6]2 Jacobson, C., Ethnicity. Contemporary Sociology, 2009, pp.425-426.
Counterpoint:International adoption laws are looser than many domestic requirements, particularly in the Western world, however this is not an argument in favour of international adoption. Domestic requirements are stringent in order for adopted children to be protected from further stress and heartache. Loose international laws do not protect the child but favour parents whom often do not meet domestic criteria and therefore are potentially a risk, not necessarily to physically harm the child but not to adequately protect and look after them. If adoption is about ensuring that the welfare of the child is always prioritized, couples should avoid international adoption programs that clearly do not put the child's interest first. Domestic programs, with strict criteria, may not permit all couples to adopt; such a response should be reluctantly accepted, not circumvented through international adoption.
