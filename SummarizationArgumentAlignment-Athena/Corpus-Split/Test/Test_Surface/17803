Point:The residents of areas where shale gas is found and drilling may occur have a right to maintain their health, something which drilling may affect. Dangerous chemicals are pumped into rock formations that are also the source of groundwater for millions of people. In 2008 a hydrologist found benzene in a water well in Wyoming above where fracking was occurring.[1] Dramatic film of inflammable gas leaking through drinking water pipes underlines the risks posed by this uncontrolled experiment under our homes.[2] Companies are in denial over these dangers, but their refusal to come clean about exactly what chemicals they are using is hardly reassuring. While there is a chance that lives are at risk, either from water contamination or from gas explosions as a result of the fracking such risky methods of extracting natural gas should be banned.
Counterpoint:Shale gas extraction is environmentally responsible and safe for human health. 95% or more of the fluid pumped into wells as part of the fracking process is ordinary water, and most of the remaining 5% is naturally-occurring sand, vegetable guar (a gum derived from beans) and nitrogen.[1] These are pumped deep underground in order to stimulate the release of gas, and then removed again at the well-head as part of the extraction process. Any fracking fluids left within the rock are so far underground that there is no danger of any contamination of groundwater sources. In the UK the Environment Agency’s “staff consider that there is a very low risk from these chemicals because there is no groundwater in or around the deep shale formation and there is a low risk of the chemicals migrating upwards and having an adverse impact on the environment.”[2] Indeed, no evidence has ever been presented of the fracking fluids getting into the water supply and if they did they could equally come from other consumer and industrial applications of the fluids,[3] while the gas could have occurred naturally.
Point:Given that some of the negative consequences from hydraulic fracturing processes may take many years to emerge, the precautionary principle should be applied. Applying the precautionary principle would mean changing the burden of proof from environmentalists having to prove that fracking does cause harm in each circumstance to it being the oil and gas firms who have to prove that fracking is safe.[1] As a result fracking should be stopped all together or at the very least greatly reducing the amount of fracking leaving only a few fields in operation so that the effects of the process can be studied and as a result sufficient legislation but in place to regulate the industry.[2] Until it can be prove these methods are entirely safe, hydraulic fracturing should be stopped and the shale gas industry denied further drilling permits.
Counterpoint:The precautionary principle simply wants ‘cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.’[1] This does not mean that fracking should have to stop in order to apply the principle. Rather as the oil and gas companies are already doing wherever possible preventing environmental degradation. The European Commission says that the precautionary principle should ‘never justify arbitrary decisions.’[2] But that is exactly what it would be doing if it was invoked to ban a whole industry just because we do not know every consequence of fracking.
Point:Expanding shale gas extraction would be very damaging to the environment as the process requires a large number of small wells to be drilled in each gas field, Ohio for example has 80,000 fracked wells[1], by comparison only 10,000 have been drilled in the UK part of the North Sea since 1964.[2] This means beautiful rural areas will be spoiled by the presence of many gas rigs, each with its accompanying pipes, buildings, tracks, etc. Agricultural and amenity land will be lost and wildlife disturbed. And heavy construction traffic will ruin roads and create noise pollution for nearby residents.
Counterpoint:All forms of energy production place some burden on the environment, but compared to any other form of fossil fuel shale gas is limited in its impact. It does not produce huge open-cast pits like tar sands or level mountains like coal-mining, it does not need massive offshore rigs like oil wells or traditional gas extraction, and it does not pose the risk of oil spills like those in the Gulf of Mexico and the Niger Delta. Indeed, many people also object to renewable energy sources such as massive solar arrays, ranks of noisy wind-turbines against the horizon, or hydro-electric schemes that drown valleys and wreck river systems. With proper regulation, the impact of shale gas wells can be made acceptable to local communities, while better horizontal drilling techniques mean fewer wells will be required in the future than in the past, in Alaska horizontal drilling has meant that wells are only needed every four miles.[1]
Point:Climate change is the biggest problem facing our planet and it requires urgent action for us to shift to a low-carbon economy. Shale gas is simply another fossil fuel, releasing carbon into the atmosphere when it is burnt to provide power. As the Tyndall Centre warns “While it is possible that shale gas could substitute for coal, within the UK, this would likely be counteracted by global use of coal and shale gas.”[1] So rather than replacing even dirtier coal as a source of power, it is likely simply to augment it, feeding our wasteful society’s insatiable appetite for energy. Indeed, if shale gas lowers the price of fossil fuels, it may contribute further to the problem by encouraging a continued rise in energy consumption.[2] Worse, by taking investment from renewable energy sources such as solar, tidal and wind energy, shale gas may postpone the necessary shift to a low-carbon economy.
Counterpoint:Shale gas provides an important route to a low-carbon economy. Burning gas to generate electricity for lighting houses and powering factories (and also perhaps increasingly for powering “plug-in” automobiles) emits much less carbon than burning coal in traditional power-stations. At the same time, shale gas can provide much more energy in the next twenty years than renewable sources such as solar, wind and tidal energy can at present offer. So if we are serious about shutting down major polluters such as coal-burning power stations and petrol-drive automobiles, it is shale gas that can provide us with a realistic and affordable lower-carbon solution. Even if targets for renewable generation of electricity are met there will still need to be electricity generation by other sources and gas is the best option.[1] The environmental case for shale gas can be further strengthened by the use of carbon sequestration whereby new technology is employed to capture the carbon emissions as gas is burnt and to store it in underground rock formations, so that it is not released into the atmosphere, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is even researching how to do this in shale.[2]
