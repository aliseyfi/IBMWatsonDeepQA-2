Point:Flying is a major source of pollution and, in particular, of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. The role of aircraft in climate change is worsened by the high altitude at which gases and particulates are released into the atmosphere. It is thought that the impact of aircraft emissions on our climate is two or three times greater than that of the same amount of CO2 when released by vehicles on the ground1. At present, aviation fuel is largely free from taxation. Most countries do not tax it for internal journeys, and international treaties prevent taxation of fuel used for international flights. For these reasons, aviation fuel (kerosene, a fossil fuel) should be taxed, in order to make the polluter pay for the damage they cause, and to encourage a reduction in the amount of emissions.
Counterpoint:The aviation industry recognizes the impact of aircraft emissions on the climate, although the extent of the damage compared to other uses of fossil fuels is still uncertain. Led by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the industry is making considerable progress towards reducing emissions. Engines are becoming more efficient and so are flight procedures, allowing fuel to be used more efficiently. ICAO pollution standards have been progressively tightened for a range of different emissions. As a result, emissions per passenger kilometer have been reduced by 70% over the past forty years. Research suggests that CO2 production can be halved by 2020 as airlines update their fleets of aircraft and technology continues to improve1. Given this voluntary progress and the continuing efforts of airlines and aerospace companies, taxation is unnecessary.
Point:A tax on aviation fuel could certainly be put into effect on an international basis. Climate change is a global problem and the ICAO was tasked in the Kyoto Protocol to look at how the aviation industry worldwide could reduce emissions. As it is in the interests of all countries to tackle aircraft emissions, an international consensus could certainly be achieved given effort. Agreements on other difficult issues have been reached in the past (e.g. the Millennium Development Goals, anti-landmine treaties, the Montreal climate change conference in 2005).
Counterpoint:A tax on aviation fuel would be impractical and impossible to put into action. Attempts to place a tax on fuel by individual states will fail, as airlines can easily obtain fuel more cheaply elsewhere. And if individual countries raise the cost of flying to and from their airports, they will lose income from tourists and business travellers to other states. Trying to put a global tax in place will also fail - international treaties actually make it illegal to tax aviation fuel (the 1944 Chicago Convention1, reinforced by many bilateral Air Service Agreements) and there is no international consensus for change.
Point:Taxing aviation fuel would encourage greater fuel economy by making kerosene more expensive. As the popularity of air travel continues to increase rapidly, it is important to put pressure on the aviation industry to use fuel as efficiently as possible, in order to hold emissions down as much as much as they are able to. With fossil fuel reserves running out, fuel conservation is also a wise use of finite resources. More expensive fuel would give airlines an incentive to adopt the most modern technology and update their fleets. They could also adopt flying practices aimed at maximizing fuel efficiency, such as flying at lower speeds.
Counterpoint:Airlines already have a price incentive to maximize fuel efficiency, so a tax on fuel is unnecessary. Fuel is a major cost item for all airlines and, as the price of fossil fuels has soared over the past few years, extra pressures have been put on airlines to change their practices and adopt new technology in order to survive. Both Boeing and Airbus have responded to this market demand by producing new aircraft with much lower emissions per passenger, and airlines are already ordering them in large numbers1. Compared to the large market swings in price for aviation fuel, a tax would have little additional impact.
Point:A tax on aviation would be international in scale and provide an excellent opportunity to raise money for development aid. The European Union is considering such a plan in order to provide additional funding to ensure its Millennium Development Goals targets will be met. France, Germany, Brazil and Chile are already calling for such an initiative, and France already unilaterally introduced a levy on flights in 2006 to go to meeting the MDGs1. In the long term, a global tax on aviation could be administered by the United Nations, providing it with a regular, predictable income safe from political interference. Greater UN control over development aid will also overcome current problems of duplication, favoritism and waste in competing national programs. Setting revenues from aviation aside to fund international aid will make a tax more acceptable to passengers, and will spread the burden of aid funding more fairly around the world.
Counterpoint:Unless a tax on aviation was so high that it damaged the airline industry, it is unlikely to meet the need for development aid. Countries have already made commitments to fund the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and they should be prepared to meet their promises out of their domestic budgets, rather than experiment with an untested gimmick. There is a danger that if politicians and voters feel international aid has its own tax, they will stop funding it from regular taxation. There are also serious questions about accountability and administration - national aid budgets are already much more likely to be well run than the programs of undemocratic international institutions such as the UN and the EU. Finally, hypothecation of revenues (money raised by a particular tax spent on only one thing) is in itself harmful. There is no reason to think that the need for development aid will go up or down with the economic fortunes of the airline industry. If another terrorist attack like 9/11 took place (or there was an international disease outbreak such as SARS or Avian flu), aviation could be badly hit once more. With such a tax, fewer flights would mean less money generated towards development aid.
