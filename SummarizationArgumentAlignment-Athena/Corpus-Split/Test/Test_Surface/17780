Point:Most Secretaries-General are compromise-candidates from middle powers and with little prior fame. High-profile candidates, like Bill Clinton, are often touted for the job, but are almost always rejected as unpalatable to some of the permanent member states. For instance, figures like Charles De Gaulle or Dwight Eisenhower are rumored to have been considered for the first Secretary-General position[1], but were rejected in favor of the uncontroversial Norwegian, Trygve Lie. Thus excellent leaders and statesmen are outright excluded from the selection process because the permanent five have no incentive to nominate a strong, forceful figure for the role. Popular election would reverse this bias, as only well-known international heavy-weight figures would be able to gain sufficient votes from citizens all over the world. Californian governor Jerry Brown signed a bill deciding to award all California electoral votes to the candidate for US president that wins the national popular vote[2]. The following analogy can be made: popular vote reflects the opinions of all over whom the person elected will have power, and should not be surpassed by bureaucracy such as veto power or the electoral college system.
Counterpoint:Simply because Secretaries-General are elected through a compromise process does not mean that they will not perform well on the job or that they will be lackeys of the permanent members. For example, Kofi Annan became a powerful and charismatic leader during his time in office. In spite of the US having supported his nomination, he was often critical of its foreign policy and human rights record in the war against terror. Another Secretary- General, Dag Hammarskjöld, developed the UN Emergency Force, deployed during the 1956 Suez Crisis in which two of the permanent five members were implicated. The deployment of troops was done with no authorization from the Security Council and has since significantly shaped the protocol on UN peacekeeping missions.[1]
Point:Gender and geographic diversity would improve among candidates. Out of eight Secretaries-General so far, a woman has yet to lead the organization. Furthermore, women candidates are rarely even considered. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, only got seven positive votes when she ran against Ban Ki-moon.[1] Getting rid of the cumbersome veto process might encourage more women to come forward. Currently, the status quo tends to perpetuate itself. The representatives who end up making the decisions on a candidates viability are usually men, from wealthy and privileged backgrounds. By bringing more people into the decision-making process, the door is open to more types of people. For example, Hilary Clinton or German Chancellor Merkel might be candidates, as well as figures from Eastern Europe (who have held no SG positions so far).
Counterpoint:Geographic diversity is already ensured by the system of regional rotation in the selection of candidates. As for gender diversity, women find it hard to get elected even in countries which have strong traditions in protecting and promoting women’s rights. Those liberal countries represent a small minority of UN member states and of world population. Confronted with a ‘world electorate’, a woman’s chances of getting elected would be slim to none.
Point:Given the evolution in the role of the Secretary-General, he/she needs skills beyond those required of a chief administrator and more closely resembling those of a statesman. Like in the case of heads of state, having to compete in a contest for the popular vote would require candidates to demonstrate their competence for the job and their vision for the future of the organization.[1] These would then become the primary considerations in the popular decision, not their pliability to the interests of the world’s richest nations.
Counterpoint:To assume that a the members of the United Nations General Assembly would be mature enough to select the most qualified, most competent candidate would be naïve. The majority is, in fact, much more likely to select a candidate that would suit their own interests. This will not only impede the selection process, but might result in an unsuitable candidate being the final choice.
