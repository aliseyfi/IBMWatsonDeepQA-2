Point:Prisoners are more likely to ease comfortably and peacefully back into civilian life if, whilst in prison, they retain links with the democratic process. Enfranchisement confers not only self-worth and meaning within a society, but can encourage research and engagement with contemporary issues. To deny this right is to force 'the disinherited (to) sit idly by while others elect his civil leaders and while others choose the fiscal and governmental policies which will govern him and his family'1. Such an outcome conveys to prisoners that not only they committed a crime, but that they committed that crime because they were incapable of acting in a manner fit for society. Mistakes made by otherwise altogether rational, beneficial members of society should not be punished by preventing their say in how that society is run.1 Johnson-Parris, A. S. (2003). Felon Disenfrachisement: The Unconscionable Social Contract Breached. Virginia Law Review, 109-138. [2]
Counterpoint:Prisoners care little about the politicians and political process that puts them in jail, therefore enfranchisement would do nothing to discourage them from re-offending. These are citizens who have shown that their means to correct supposed wrongs are not that political process or the rule of law, but crime. Prison should be about deterring criminals from re-offending through taking away their rights, like freedom, and demonstrating to them the price paid if you act contrary to the interests of society at large. That would be effective as part of their rehabilitation.
Point:Prisoners remain human beings. We should respect their human rights and should infringe upon their liberty as little as possible, except where it concerns the protection of the public. Denying prisoners the right to vote does not protect the public in any way and is therefore an unwarranted infringement upon the human rights of prisoners. As the U.S. Congress decreed in 1993, 'the right of citizens to vote is a fundamental right'1. Those rights which are unalienable should not be lost when one is incarcerated.1 U.S. Congress. (2003, May 20). Civil Rights Division. Retrieved May 18, 2011, from The United States Department of Justice: [3]
Counterpoint:Prisoners remain human beings but the right to vote is not fundamental, for it is not granted to all; only the trusted members of society are granted the right to vote; Minors, for example, are deemed not responsible enough and therefore have to wait until they are a certain age for the right to vote. Prisoners are deemed similarly irresponsible and therefore stripped of their right. As the U.S. Supreme Court ordered in 2000, the law 'does not protect the right of all citizens to vote, but rather the right of all qualified citizens to vote'1. Prisoners disqualify themselves through their actions; if, as a British Member of Parliament put it, the courts deem a prisoner unfit for normal society, how can it be sensible to give them a sayin how that society is run?â€™2
Point:The refusal to grant prisoners the right to vote 'is not demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society'1. Such societies pride themselves on the participation of all in the political process, regardless of wealth, class, gender or sexual orientation. The objective of such systems, to ensure that all views are represented fairly and voters represented equally, does not stop at the gates of a prison. Issues such as prison overcrowding and abuse by warders are not treated seriously as political issues, since those most directly affected cannot vote and the public generally has little interest in prisoners' well-being. Prisoners should also have the opportunity to influence the formation of policy on healthcare, education, the environment and all the other issues that affect the world into which almost all of them will someday be released. Prisoners are not treated as "civically dead" when it benefits the State: they are liable for taxation on any earnings and savings that they have. There should be no taxation without representation.1 CTV News. (2002, November 1). Supreme Court backs prisoners' right to vote. Retrieved May 18, 2011, from CTV News: [6]
Counterpoint:If prisoners refuse to act responsibly in a democratic system, why should their views and needs be represented? As regards the claim that since they pay tax, they deserve representation, in practice few prisoners earn enough to be liable for taxation. In any case, the right to vote does not follow from the obligation to pay tax. In many countries, people start earning money and paying tax before they are old enough to vote (particularly if they leave school as soon as they are allowed to do so). This implies that the right to vote is given to those who can be expected to use it responsibly. Those convicted of serious enough crimes to be imprisoned have shown that they have no respect for society and, given the vote, would 'make a mockery of justice'1. They therefore cannot be trusted to vote responsibly in the interests of society; many would probably simply vote for candidates promising lighter sentences for criminals. Prisoners' interests are already represented by NGOs and statutory prison inspection bodies, which ensure that they are not ill-treated. They do not deserve any further representation.1 BBC News.

Point:The right to vote is enshrined in the constitution or legislation of all democratic states and their collective parts. Governments, national and state, and their elected officials are charged with passing the changes to such documents that would permit or deny the right to vote to specific groups in society. In the United States, only two states, Main and Virginia, have laws allowing incarcerated felons to vote1. In Australia, a 2008 High Court ruling passed the right to vote to all felons serving sentences of three years of less2. Both examples prove the capacity of the state legislature to rule on the issue of the prisoner's right to vote.1 Gramlich, J. (2008, September 23) Groups push to expand ex-felon voting.

Counterpoint:A legislative mechanism on its own is insufficient to determine whether prisoners are granted the right to vote in any specific environment; a public and political will must also be present. When the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the British denial of prisoners' right to vote was a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, public outcry in Britain, both among the general population and in Parliament, prevented the passing of new legislation1. In February of 2011, the British Parliament voted 234 to 22 in favor of maintaining the ban, in direct repudiation of the European Court's insistence that the law be changed2.1 Press Association (2010, November 2) Prisoners to get the right to vote.

Point:Many people who commit serious crimes are not sent to prison because of their age, the effects upon their dependents or the likelihood that they will not re-offend. Others committing equivalent or lesser crimes, without these special circumstances, may be imprisoned. Even if it were ever right to deprive people of the vote as a punishment, this should not automatically be associated with imprisonment, but should be decided separately, as in France and Germany. As the Australian Democrats argue, 'to deny [the right to vote] is to impose an additional penalty on top of that judged appropriate by the court'1.1 Allison, L. (2006, November 1). Voting Rights of Prisoners. Retrieved May 18, 2011, from Australian Democrats: [12]
Counterpoint:The supposed arbitrary nature of disenfranchisement for prisoners is not an argument for letting all, or indeed any, prisoners vote. The imposition of a prison sentence is a good general index of the seriousness of a crime, and those who have committed serious crimes should suffer "civic death". Where people are exceptionally not imprisoned, they should be deprived of the right to vote for the period for which they would usually have been imprisoned. As David Cameron has admitted, 'it makes me physically ill to contemplate giving the vote to prisoners. They should lose some rights including the right to vote'11 Quinn, B. (2011, April 12).
