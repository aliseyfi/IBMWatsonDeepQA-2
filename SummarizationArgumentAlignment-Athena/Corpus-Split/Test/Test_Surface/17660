Point:Ransom payments are means to ends, and when utilized by criminal organizations, those ends are similarly criminal. Stop paying ransoms, and the funds for criminal activities will dry up. When the African Union banned the practice in 2009, Algeria argued one of its primary motivations was preventing the likes of Al Qaeda 'using ransoms it receives in neighbouring countries to finance attacks on security forces inside Algeria'1. In the Philippines, police officials have called for criminalization due to fears that ransom payments have allowed Abu Sayyef, a militia linked with Al Qaeda, to survive and finance deadly bomb attacks2.
Counterpoint:Even if ransom payments are used to finance other crimes, why are payees therefore responsible for those crimes? The ransom is not paid so that these crimes can be committed, but rather in order to ensure those held captive are returned unharmed. Families and captives themselves should not have to sacrifice their loved ones or themselves in order to prevent some prospective future crime from occurring. It is the responsibility of the police force to do that, victims of kidnappings should be able to use their own money to protect themselves, however selfish their motivations.
Point:In situations where police forces are inadequate, it is even worse to incentivise ransom further by giving kidnappers virtual certainty of payment (as is the status quo in many areas). It is this combination which underlies the epidemic nature of ransom in some parts of the world. At least if payments were criminalised, potential kidnappers would know that a pay-off would be less likely, and thus some would decide it was not worth the risk. This would allow police forces to concentrate resources on the remaining cases where kidnappers are more determined.
Counterpoint:Kidnappers would not be deterred for police forces would be in no position to concentrate resources once ransom payments are criminalised. If this law is to be anything other than dead-letter, they would have to take rigorous steps to monitor and investigate victims of ransom demands to ensure they did not make payments. This would be a highly damaging distraction in a situation where the full focus and resources of the police are needed elsewhere. Further, the knowledge that they would be under scrutiny would likely deter many victims of ransom demands from contacting the police in the first place. This may make sometimes situations even more dangerous for victims of ransom.
Point:Ransom payments should be criminalized and payees arrested if they are found to have paid a ransom. The police should retain a monopoly on all negotiations, both to ensure kidnappings are not materially rewarded and to improve their own efforts to stop the practice. While not all kidnappings may end peacefully, if the police are aware of them all, it may only take a few leads in a few cases to break a kidnapping ring and reduce the threat to society as a whole. Furthermore, the involvement of police will drag out hostage negotiations, making the overall industry less profitable to kidnappers for whom time is money. The African Union in 2009 adopted such a resolution, 'condemning the payment of ransoms to terrorist groups to secure the freedom of hostages'1.
Counterpoint:The criminalization of ransom payments both leaves the payee in a no-win situation and overestimates the effect of such a policy on kidnappers. Firstly, the very first demand of kidnappers is that the ransom payee does not contact the police, often at risk of the life of the kidnap victim. Once more, it seems cruel to demand that individuals take this significant risk. Secondly, ransom cases often occur precisely because there is a low chance of detection, or due to the untrustworthiness of local police and security forces. It may be preferable for ransom victims to contact the police, but this is best achieved not by coercion, but by making the police a genuine and trustworthy asset in such cases. In Colombia, which has experienced a decline in kidnapping figures from its heights in the mid-2000s, the success is attributed to a proactive policy using the military, rather than a reliance on a reactive police force1. The belief that criminalizing ransom payments will have any positive effect is myopic at best.
Point:Bluntly, the payment of ransom is exactly what the criminal in question wants. It aids them financially, and brings a swift conclusion to a risky situation. Both of these factors greatly decrease the chances of their detection and capture. Given the threat posed by such serious criminals it is more than reasonable for the state to prohibit an action such as ransom payment, which so greatly rewards criminal behaviour. The potential rewards of kidnapping has also led to the practice spreading across borders. In 1999, 92% of all kidnappings took place in just ten countries; by 2007, the practice had spread to six more countries1. So long as ransoms continue to be paid, the practice will not stop spreading.
Counterpoint:Ransom payments do reward criminal behaviour but they are the lesser evil. Paying a ransom ensures both that the captives are released without harm and prevents the criminals from committing a more serious crime. Furthermore, the criminal behaviour is not the 'fault' of the ransom payee, therefore the payee cannot be blamed either for the kidnapping or any later crimes. Police remain responsible for preventing crimes occurring in the first place, regardless of the resources of the criminals. The spread of kidnapping as a practice therefore reflect the quality of the police forces in those countries, and cannot be blamed on ransom payees.
Point:The payment of ransom has very real and serious practical harms for society. In addition to aiding the non-detection of such criminals, the payment greatly increases their ability to conduct such acts in future. As many cases of ransom take place within networks of organised crime - the funding from these payments can greatly increase the capability for further acts of ransom (and other crimes) in the future. In states like Mexico, where up to forty per cent of the national population feel unsafe due to profligate kidnapping, more has to be done to discourage or capture kidnappers1 This provides solid ground for criminalising acts which propagate such activity. Society is not merely harmed by fears for one's own safety, financial fears still exist over the extent of the Somalian piracy epidemic. Despite more than $80 million being paid to pirates in 2008 alone, ransom prices continue to rise2,3 .With ships and cargoes continually willing to pay, the costs may eventually be passed onto consumers.
Counterpoint:Kidnappings would not cease if ransoms stopped being paid. Kidnappings are also carried out as a means of stoking fears within a population; in which case, the murder of a kidnapped victim will achieve that purpose just as easily. Furthermore, the harm to society is arguably less if all ransoms were paid and victims returned. If the proposition's model were to be adopted, the number of victims killed would rise and citizens would be far more worried about the risk of kidnapping as a result.
