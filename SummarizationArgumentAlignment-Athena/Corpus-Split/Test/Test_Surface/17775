Point:The Internet has become a major source of information for many people. However, online information has usually not gone through the same checks as newspaper articles, books or factual television programming. There is a higher risk that some of the facts or quotations from a particular source in an article are false. Whereas newspapers might lose customers if people find out they have been ‘selling lies’, a blog and other online content can be easily created and uploaded as well as just as quickly being deleted. If people base their opinions on the information they find online, they could well be basing their opinion on false information. Take for example the 2006 conspiracy film Loose Change which has had millions of views. A report from the thinktank Demos in a report titled “Truth, Lies and the Internet: A Report into Young People’s Digital Fluency”[1] state that the film contains a “...litnay of errors, misattributions, vague insinuations, subtle misquotes, and outright falsehoods...” Since the Internet gives equal space to material of greatly varying quality, the degree to which the internet can been viewed as being a total force for good is drawn into question. If an informed society is an empowered society it therefore stands to reason that a misinformed society is disempowered society.
Counterpoint:The Internet gives millions of people access to information they would not otherwise have had, which is a huge benefit. People who read the news, offline or online, are not inherently dupable, they like all people do not simply accept messages they are, to varying degrees, critical of what they read and not simply passive. When people spend a lot of time reading online content they can differentiate between bloggers who are untrustworthy or extremely biases from bloggers who carefully refer to legitimate sources. The problem of bad information in news-making is not unique to the Internet; there are lots of trashy magazines and poorly researched news content in traditional print channels of communication as well. We learn in formal education to double-check our sources and not believe everything we read, and we can apply that skill while surfing the Internet.
Point:Everyone’s privacy can be greatly harmed by the Internet. Some websites store information. Some ask us to fill in information which can be sold to other sites for commercial purposes. As the Internet gains more and more users the temptation for criminals to gain our private information becomes greater. Hackers can hide their true location when engaging in illegal activities online, so the likelihood of their being brought to justice is low. Whenever people post something online, it becomes almost impossible to erase, and with the proliferation of social networks posting personal information online is becoming second nature, this is a dangerous precedent. Take for example the posting of our locations online via geotagging, this for many is an action which doesn’t take much consideration, however, to demonstrate the danger of this designer Barry Borsoom setup the website PleaseRobMe.com which would grab geocaching data and tell people when a person’s house was potentially empty.[1]
Counterpoint:Privacy online is a big concern, but an educated citizen can navigate the Internet in a safe and sensible manner with minimal privacy issues, although as with being offline a the threat of crime can never be entirely eliminated. When we go online no-one forces the user to share private information, it is volunteered by the user in exchange for a free service, it is often a small price to pay for the services that can be received in return, such as free e-mail or free webspace. Of course privacy can be infringed in other ways, by unlawful access to personal files for example, but if protection such as firewalls are setup and users are careful about what they download privacy online can be easily maintained. It is misleading to say we are sleeping walking into a big brother existence, it gives in impression that the effect the Internet is having on society is conspiratorial, this is clearly not the case, people like the way the Internet can bring people all over the world together. Privacy is no more of a problem online than privacy is in the offline world, the issue is being overstated by the proposition.
Point:The ability for anyone to be able to publish anything online without barriers resulted in a large amount of information which could not only be incorrect but could also be criminal, offensive or discriminatory if it were available to the general public. This sort of information would not usually be widely published via offline channels, but with the advent of the Internet it is very easily accessible by anyone like never before, and this is a dangerous president. A cavalcade of propaganda from extremist groups such as religious zealots or Neo-Nazis for example can be accessed by anyone around the world. This is dangerous as vulnerable people could easily be taken in and exploited if the discovered this material. It is quite often found that ‘lone-wolf’ terrorists, for example, have gotten their information and inspiration from the Internet. Garry Reid, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Combating Terrorism in the USA states that “Enabled by 21st-century technology, extremists have optimized the use of Internet chat rooms, Web sites and e-mail chains to spread their virulent messages and reach a global audience of potential recruits”.[1] But it is not only terrorists who are utilizing the Internet at a detriment to society. Various reports have linked a sharp rise in paedophilia with the growth of the Internet[2] as it is an easy and often anonymous way to share such material with the world. The ability for anyone to publish anything online could clearly do considerable harm to society, which would have otherwise been much less prevalent and easier to control and regulate.
Counterpoint:Freedom of information should mean freedom of all types of information, even if it is extreme propaganda from fringe groups such as neo-Nazis or Al-Qaeda. The public must be trusted to be able to make its own decisions on the value of such texts. What is great about the Internet is that points of view that would not necessarily get much publicity in traditional media can be aired and discussed online, from serious issues such as capital punishment to less serious ones like aliens. Of course one of the downfalls of such freedom is that illegal content such as child pornography can be made available in a way which it could not have before, but highlighting this issue is not entirely fair as it is greatly outweighed by the information available online that is perfectly fine and legal. This does not of course excuse the publication of such images. It is, however, a slight misnomer to suggest that the Internet is entirely free from the restraints of law. In issues of legality, governments can take action: they can either trace the origin of the images or force web space providers and ISPs (Internet Service Providers) to take down the content. On the whole, having ready access to such a large amount of information, and being able to freely add and discuss it, is beneficial to society, because it is both liberating and educational.
