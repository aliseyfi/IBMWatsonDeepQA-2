Point:To members of ethnic minority groups overt public celebrations of Christmas can seem like a form of aggressive evangelism. It is an ethical duty of both Christians and society more generally to respect the beliefs of others, this makes the term "Happy Holidays" a much more appropriate greeting as it takes into account the mid-winter festivals of other faiths and cultures such as Hanukkah, Kwanza, Diwali, Eid, Ashura, to name a few. The Red Cross in 2003 banned nativity decorations from its British shops because it stated that an alignment to a particular religion could compromise its ability to work in conflict situations around the world1. It is a Christian ideal to be tolerant of others, and limiting the use of the term Christmas in favor of more inclusive terms would be an incredible display of this, the term Christmas would not be banned, but its use limited to specific occasions in which it specifically refers to Christian based activities rather than the general celebration that is seen throughout the mid-winter period.1 Mirza, M. Christmas is banned! Or is it? Spiked: [2]
Counterpoint:Christianity is entirely respectful to others, this can be seen particular in contrast to extreme factions of other religions which desire complete dominance. Christians and western nations do not seek to ban the celebration of other religious festivals, however this does not give consent to mothball all winter festivals into a singular name, many other religions as well as the Christianity are against this. While the feelings of ethnic minority groups should be took into consideration it must be remembered that Christianity is often the dominant religion in many western countries, Christianity is on the whole not trying to aggressively force their religion onto others, however if a majority wish to celebrate it they should be allowed to, should Hanukkah become more dominant that would equally rise to the top, the expression of religion on the whole should not be regulated, all religions should have the right to celebrate their distinctness throughout the mid-winter period.
Point:Public celebrations and festivals are all either organized or funded by the state, or otherwise have to gain their approval before they can go ahead. Therefore, if the state were to decide that Christmas celebrations were to be banned, it would be a fairly simple process to ensure they were stopped. The British city of Birmingham in 1998 altered the name of its Christmas festival to 'Winterval', proving it can be done1. At public schools, states have a means to inform principals that Christmas celebrations will not be permitted. Punishments to individual principals whose schools do not obey could act as a deterrent to certain individuals informing their teachers to act contrary to the ban and thereafter claiming deniability.1Daily [1] Mail. Campaign for a real Christmas. [1]
Counterpoint:Such a ban would be impossible to enforce and therefore achieve little. Christmas celebrations are not consigned to those in schools and public places. A state cannot prevent individuals and communities from celebrating Christmas – an attempt to do so would merely encourage those celebrating to do so on a grander scale. Such a tactic therefore would achieve the opposite of its intention – drawing attention to the Christian-ness of the population and encouraging Christians to flaunt their religion and celebrate ‘their’ Christmas. Muslim fears in the UK that it would lead to a backlash against them are well-founded1. If the state was truly concerned about integration of religious communities, they would celebrate Christmas openly each year and a whole host of other festivals in between.
Point:Christmas celebrations in the Western world, held in schools and public squares, do not respect the rights of those who are not religious. For school children who do not share the majority-Christian faith, Christmas celebrations require either their participation when they do not want to, through coercion, or their non-participation and therefore isolation whilst everyone else celebrations their inclusiveness. States should instead be sponsoring and celebrating events that everyone can join in equally, regardless of religion, race or class. 'Happy Holidays' is a generic term for the December break that does not discriminate between Christians and non-Christians, or indeed between the religious and the non-religious. Furthermore, even Christmas symbols like the Christmas symbol could be co-adopted to appeal to non-Christians; Boston in 2005 re-named its Christmas Tree to 'Holiday Tree'1. A tolerant, multi-cultural state would not stop there, but ban the public naming of Christmas and celebrate the 'holidays' instead.1 Bazar, E. Trimming 'Christmas' from trees stirs debate. USA Today: [4]
Counterpoint:The celebration of Christmas is only infringing on either of those principles if it is the only event that is celebrated publically. That, however, is not the case. Prominent religious events like the Hindu Diwali, the Muslim Eid, the Jewish Hanukah and the Christian Easter are all celebrated at different times of the year, by members of all faiths
Point:The Christmas break is no longer a Christian festival, but a multi-cultural celebration during Christmas; the state should not be sponsoring events specific to Christians during a holiday for all religious and non-religious citizens. Christmas is now celebrated not only in Western nations but the world over, it is celebrated not only by individuals which are not Christian but whole nations which do not subscribe to the Christian belief system. The holiday has transcended its origins, while it still represents some conceptual Christian notions it is no longer for the most part a Christian festival. Much of the symbolism now used has more relation to Pagan traditions than Christian ones with things such as the Christmas tree and mistletoe originating from the pre-Christian religion, in addition other common symbols have come from popular culture such as snowmen and reindeer. Very rarely now are the traditional symbols of a Christian Christmas actually displayed publicly or even in the homes of Christians themselves, with many preferring the symbolism of the modern multi-cultural Christmas. A UK study found that three out of four employers have banned Christmas decorations because they are concerned not to offend other faiths1. It seems only logical to describe public displays by other terminology as this would reflect more truly on the celebrations of the winter period.1 Furedi, F. Do they know it's Christmas? Spiked: [5]
Counterpoint:Christmas is no longer solely a Christian festival, but that is in fact more of a reason to retain its history and cherish the inclusiveness of the celebrations. While it is certainly true that Christmas is celebrated by many more people than just Christians, this inclusiveness should be noted by the state and used as an opportunity to bring communities and religions together. People who are not Christian who engage with the festival will still know the reason behind the celebration, the birth of Christ and will more widely know what he did with his time on earth. It is true that mixed in with Christian symbology there are now many other symbols from a non-Christian non-religious background, what this demonstrates is the liberalness of the Christian faith showing that it can adapt to modern trends as long as the core message remains, this should not be exploited as a way to neutralize the power of the religion through political correctness restraints but should be applauded and garter respect. Due to this ability to adapt Christmas can be enjoyed by all and still maintain its Christian roots without the need to change the terminology of the festival.
