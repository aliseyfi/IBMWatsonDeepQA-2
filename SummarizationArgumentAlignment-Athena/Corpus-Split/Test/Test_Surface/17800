Point:Elections only come around every four years or so, allowing unethical or incompetent politicians to do a lot of damage in office before facing the judgment of their constituents. And after three years or so, many voters may have forgotten about their offending behavior, allowing them to get away with it. In any case, regular elections seldom focus on the record of one particular candidate for a legislature, but are a referendum on their party as a whole. If their party remains popular, or if their seat is a safe one, then incompetent and unethical politicians will often be re-elected regardless of their personal failings. Such was the case in California, where immediately before the recall, Gray Davis (a Democrat) was re-elected simply because the local Republican Party had self-destructed.[1]
Counterpoint:In reality, most recall votes in systems where they are allowed come down to judgments about policy decisions. In 2003 no one accused Gray Davis of being personally corrupt or mentally incapable of wielding power. Davis was ejected as Governor of California because voters didn’t like the way he had handled power-utilities and tried to solve the state’s debt problems. Not only should Davis have been allowed to serve out his term so that voters could judge him on the long-term success of his policies in these areas; the struggles of his successor as Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with much the same set of problems suggest that getting rid of Davis did little to address the underlying problems facing California.
Point:People today are apathetic and distrustful about politics, which is very unhealthy for a democracy. Low turnouts in elections mean that governments today lack moral authority. Giving people more direct control would create more interest in politics, and get more people educated and active about the issues that affect them. In other words, allowing recall elections will help to restore faith in politics and encourage active citizenship. Enabling ordinary voters to sack unsatisfactory representatives will give them an incentive to monitor what their politicians are doing in office, and will encourage the media to cover legislative affairs more fully than they do at present.[1]
Counterpoint:If people are uninterested or uninformed about politics, then it is not clear that giving them more control over it is a good idea. Giving such people more control over politics may be detrimental. Moreover, people who cannot be bothered to vote or take interest in politics once every four years are not very likely to be bothered to vote in recall elections as well.
Point:Having a recall mechanism focuses the minds of elected representatives and ensures that they keep the interests of their constituents constantly in mind. Not only will this lead to harder working politicians with higher ethical standards, it will also prevent them selling out to lobby groups and party whips. All too often elected representatives give way to the lure of “business as usual” in the capital city, and forget the folks who sent them there in the first place. A system which provides the opportunity for a recall will give voters more power than what they currently have – cast a ballot once every four or five years. For the reasons outlined above, i.e. that voters may simply lack quality of choice in election time, giving them the ability to demand a recall decreases the democratic deficit[1].
Counterpoint:The overwhelming numbers of elected representatives at every level already keep the concerns of their constituents constantly in mind, working very long hours in their interest. Recall systems are offensive as they imply that all politicians are crooks who need some kind of parole procedure. In addition, too much focus on very local interests can make politics very parochial and lead to too little consideration of the overall national interest, allowing small minorities to block necessary reforms and encouraging wasteful “pork barrel” spending. Finally, recall elections are not the only means to hold politicians to high standards of behavior; if they stray ethically they can already be punished by the courts, by impeachment, or by legislative ethics panels.
