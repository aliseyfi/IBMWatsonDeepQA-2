Point:If we accept the term 'arts' to cover museums, galleries, theatres and musical and film projects, then it is clear that without public funding in many countries a large proportion of arts organisations would be lost. Taking the UK as a prime example of what happens when funding for the arts is cut, we can see that of the 1333 companies which applied for funding from Arts Council England in 2010 only 695 were successful. A cut of £100M has meant this number has dropped from the 849 organisations that were granted funding in the previous application process1. The Arts Council is responsible for the funding of cultural venues, theatres, galleries and performing arts groups, and this cut to its budget demonstrates the depth of repercussions that occur when the arts cease to be subsidised. There is also evidence to suggest that the American system of philanthropic donations simply doesn’t work in the UK, as investment in the arts by the business sector was shown in figures released in January 2011 to have fallen by 11%2.
Counterpoint:There are alternatives to public funding - the arts have relied on patronage and donations for a very long time, and there are examples of a positive relationship between the arts and business enterprises. There could be better utilisation of this relationship - America is a prime example of this. Although there are organisations set up in America to provide money for the arts such as The National Endowments for Arts set up in 1965,1 they rely far more on donations from businesses and wealthy individuals than companies do in the UK and Europe. Given the cuts to public spending especially in the UK, an introduction of American philanthropic ideas is a viable means to bridge the gap in funding caused by the economic situation. As well as this, it is important to note that of the 695 organisations given grants, 110 of them were new projects. This shows that even in a time of economic strife, the limited resources available can be deployed in such a way that art and culture remains up-to-date and that new art can still be produced.
Point:Since the lottery began in Britain in1994 over £25 billion has been given to ‘good causes’. Last year (2010) 16.67% of the donations made were to arts organisations, the same amount that was given to sport and heritage projects1. This money makes up an significant part of many organisation’s budgets, and stopping this funding whilst still giving to sports and heritage foundations would be discriminatory and unfair. Equal distribution of this public lottery is the only way to ensure that people are being fairly treated when they buy their lottery ticket, even though the ‘good causes’ their money goes to may not be their primary concern.
Counterpoint:In the same year (2010), 50% of the donations made by the National Lottery in the UK were to Health, Education, Environment, and charitable causes. This in itself demonstrates an awareness of the need to prioritise public spending into more socially and economically important areas. On the subject of fairness, it would be difficult to argue that the same number of people benefit from donations to the arts as they do from donations to health, education and charitable organisations. Even if buyers of lottery tickets do not think about where their money goes, if they were to do so they would be happier to see it go to these areas rather than to arts projects that are beneficial only to a select group.
Point:The reduction in available services would make arts less accessible to all, and although the demand would still be there, forcing companies to ensure they make a profit will drive ticket prices up and prevent those from poorer backgrounds from being able to enjoy the same cultural experiences as those who are wealthy. Subsidy can ensure that cheaper tickets are available and that the arts remain democratically open to all, regardless of income or social class. It also allows other public institutions which have similar economic problems such as schools and colleges to provide better services for their students, giving them access to better teaching resources and therefore a better quality of education.1 It would be unfair and inaccurate to assume that the benefits of arts subsidy only go to the wealthy elite, as the focus is on providing arts projects for all members of society. Free and cheap access to the arts is crucial for education. Without subsidy schools and young people would not be able to take affordable music lessons, visit museums or galleries, or to attend plays or concerts, and would thereby be prevented from understanding and enjoying their culture fully. As well as being important for personal enrichment, access to the arts also makes the young aware of their cultural heritage both nationally and in world terms, increasing the likelihood of continued interest in the arts and its creation in the future.
Counterpoint:Other, equally deserving public leisure activities either do not need to, or simply do not receive any such funding - why is is that the arts are deemed to have greater importance, especially given that they are proven to not be self-sufficient. Certain art forms, such as live music events and special exhibitions charge entrance fees and people are willing to pay them. Looking at it from the perspective of what art actually means, if people are not willing to pay to support it, then it has surely failed in its purpose to provide something culturally relevant. Brian Micklethwait of the Libertarian Alliance argues that good art can survive economic difficulties,1 and that if the arts really are as important in society as some people say, then the public would be willing to spend money to view it, just as they do for a concert or a football match.
