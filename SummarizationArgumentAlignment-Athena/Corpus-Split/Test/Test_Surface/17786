Point:Professional cheerleaders cause men to think of women as objects. They exist on the sidelines, wearing short skirts and looking pretty, whilst the male sports players are the heroes. This affects the way that men view women more generally. It makes them think that women are less important than men. Even where professional cheerleading squads contain men, this view of women is reinforced: male cheerleaders lift women and throw them around as if they are objects and only there for decoration.
Counterpoint:The cheerleaders have a clear role – to support the sports team – and therefore it is their talent being showcased. If this is an example of women being objectified, then there are clearly much more important examples to focus on; banning professional cheerleading would achieve nothing.
Point:Professional cheerleaders affect how people view women in general, and therefore there is harm to society. Although freedom of choice is often important, it is inhibited at the point that one person starts to harm others or society. As this happens in this case, cheerleading should be banned.
Counterpoint:Professional cheerleaders do not harm society; on the contrary, by making sports more exciting and engaging, they encourage an interest in sports, which is good for society because of the health and community benefits. Community benefits are seen in the reporting of local high school games in local newspapers. It is a focus of interest for the community, bringing people together. However, this interest in sport first stems from the enjoyment of sport on a larger scale in professional tournaments.
Point:Professional cheerleaders are bad role models for women, and especially for teenagers who take part in cheerleading. They tend to wear shorter skirts and show more of their skin than college and high school cheerleaders. In addition, their routines tend to be more obviously sexual, and less focused on gymnastic stunts.
Counterpoint:In many sports, women wear clothes that are tight or short; this is because the sports require agility, and excess clothing would impede their ability. For example, gymnasts wear tight leotards and tennis players wear short skirts or shorts. There are plenty of gymnastic stunts in cheerleading, and to suggest that they ‘tend’ to be sexual is a misrepresentation of the truth.
Point:A large number of women and teenage girls suffer from eating disorders.[1] Part of the desire to be thin comes from the constant parade of ‘perfect’ women. Professional cheerleaders often have much of their body on show, and as men cheer them and comment on their looks, the message to women is reinforced: it is important to fit a specific version of beauty.
Counterpoint:Models, celebrities and magazines all emphasise looks and figure. If cheerleaders are thin, then they are not the worst offender, and in fact, are positive in the way that they show that a good figure comes from exercise rather than dangerous diets.
Point:Women are very talented at sport, as demonstrated by Venus and Serena Williams in tennis, Paula Radcliff in athletics or Nastia Liukin in gymnastics. However, when people see cheerleaders they are more likely to view women’s role in sport as one confined to looking pretty on the sidelines. Women’s sport already receives a lot less coverage than men’s sport, and it is important to promote the success that women achieve. Professional cheerleaders detract from this. This is further true considering that many of the women participating in professional cheerleading would no doubt be very talented at other athletic pursuits.
Counterpoint:There is no reason why professional cheerleaders cannot be respected for the athletic talent that cheerleading requires. If we want women’s sport to be more respected, it might be necessary to spend more money promoting games or force the media to cover a larger number of female sporting events, rather than focusing on men. However, professional cheerleaders do not stop any of these sports from being treated seriously.
Point:Professional cheerleaders discourage lots of women, religious people and families from attending professional sports games. Many people do not want to watch women dancing on the pitch wearing skimpy clothes, so do not attend. Similarly, they do not bring their children because they think that it is inappropriate. Professional sports games are a great way to bring people together to form a community. It also encourages children to take part in sport themselves, improving their health. Professional cheerleaders are harmful because they discourage such attendance.[1]
Counterpoint:Sports teams pay cheerleaders to support them. If this didn’t have a positive effect on attendance, they would not do so. This shows that the number of conservative parents is vastly outweighed by other viewers who do not mind.
Point:Cheerleading is a highly strenuous sport. It combines gymnastics with dance. It is also high impact, very energetic and requires sophisticated synchronized moves. Not only do college teams and high school teams cheer their sports teams, but they also perform at competitions.
Counterpoint:Conversely, having professional teams gives young cheerleaders something to aspire to. Many college cheerleaders go on to win places on professional squads and that is a high accolade for many. Professionals may not go to competitions, but that does not mean they do not have an opportunity to demonstrate their athletic prowess. In fact, without the stress of competitive cheerleading, professional squads have more freedom to experiment with new ideas and techniques, which competitive squads do not have time for. This means professional squads can potentially showcase even greater talent than competitive squads.
