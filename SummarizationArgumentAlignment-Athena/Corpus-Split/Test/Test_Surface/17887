Point:Tourism vastly increases income within a particular state or region, not only through direct spending by tourists, but also as a result of increases in tax revenue and the growth of local markets for food, services and luxury goods. Tourism provides a boost to the amount of capital available in an area that purely local spending cannot achieve, even if assisted by government subsidies or tax breaks for domestic businesses.
Counterpoint:Even if the tourist trade is used as a launch pad for an economy seeking diversity and stability, it must still consent to spending an extended period of time completely dependent on the funds of tourists and tour operators. This constitutes a significant risk. There is no guarantee that a particular state or region will remain a popular tourist destination. Further, tourist-led economies are highly vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters, political and humanitarian disasters (such as wars and pandemics) and financial fluctuations.
Point:Forming close ties with resource extraction firms and manufacturers is a popular development strategy for many poorer states, but it offers significant disadvantages in comparison to tourism. Not only does resource extraction, by its very nature, require states to consent to its territory sustaining pervasive and long-term environmental damage, it also tends to incentivise infrastructure projects that are only of use to the resource extraction industry. Roads can ferry medical supplies to communities as easily as they ferry tourists. An oil pipeline will only ever be useful for transporting oil.
Counterpoint:While the resolution may suggest that income from tourism will serve to adjust the inequality in bargaining power between the poor residence of tourist destinations and wealthy tour firms, an area’s identity as a tourist destination often inhibits development. The purchase of land by tour companies may expropriate existing occupants who hold land subject to poorly defined rights or customary principles that are not recognised in courts of law. The repurposing of land to serve the tourist trade often excludes the possibility of economic diversification – land occupied by a hotel cannot also be used as farmland. The construction of ports inhibits the development of marine life across a wide area of surrounding coast line. Governments may be reluctant to intervene to address economic inequalities of this type, for fear that seizing a firm’s assets might prompt capital flight or costly legal challenges.
Point:Managed properly, tourism and the conservation of wildlife habitats and areas of archaeological significance need not be mutually exclusive activities. Indeed, recent trends in ecotourism have demonstrated that tourists themselves can be co-opted to monitor and survey the environments that they are visiting. The fees paid by tourists to gain access to heritage locations such as Pompeii, the valley of kings and Machu Pichu can be funnelled into restoration and preservation schemes on those sites.
Counterpoint:The damage that tourists cause is not limited to archaeological sites and local ecosystems. The presence of tourists can also destabilise and perturb the routines and traditions of an area’s communities. Within developing states, tourists can cause significant disruption and damage to the patterns of ordinary life. Religious, artistic, medical and agricultural knowledge is considered to be an important resource by a wide range of aboriginal and forth world communities. What tourists may assume to be innocent queries can constitute an attempt to acquire carefully taught skills and practices, bound closely to a group’s identity and history.
