Point:Government employees are, ultimately, duty bound to uphold the policies and principles implemented by the executive branch. The executive is limited in its range of action – it is necessary to delegate certain of its duties to bodies such as the police, the military and the education services.
Counterpoint:Working for a state is no different to any other job. Indeed, social services that may be provided by the state in one western liberal democracy will be provided by private or third sector businesses in another. A significant proportion of the American healthcare industries are either privatised or partially subsidised.
Point:Allowing teachers and youth leaders to be members of extremist political groups presents a significant risk to children and young adults. There is, of course, an unsubtle point to be made about the possibility that teachers with extremist views may attempt to indoctrinate their charges.
Counterpoint:Under the status quo, teachers in most western liberal democracies are already obliged to conceal their political beliefs from their students. This convention also frequently applies to higher education institutions in many states. Thus, it is already possible to discipline or dismiss teachers who engage in overtly political activities within the classroom.
Point:It is often unclear whether extremist political organisations are likely to become violent or to engage in provocative acts of hate speech. Although the state does not have a right to obstruct or prevent such organisations from meeting or protesting, it does have a right to control the manner and circumstances in which such meetings take place. Doing so ensures that citizens who do not want to be involved in, or whose activities and freedoms might be materially affected by the articulation of extremist views can go about their business without hindrance. Part of the state’s role is to balance these sets of incommensurate rights. All western liberal democracies use their police forces to enforce this balance.
Counterpoint:State employees- including members of the security and police services- encounter conflicts of interest throughout their working lives. A police officer may become involved in a case in which a member of his or her family is suspect. A civil servant or local council worker may be required to determine whether friends, family or a partner should receive a state funded subsidy.
