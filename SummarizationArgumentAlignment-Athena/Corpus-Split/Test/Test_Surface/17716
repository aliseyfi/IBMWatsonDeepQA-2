Point:Up to 2009, the percentage of students in England studying literature to General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) level had been declining year on year1. In 2010 there was an introduction of a combined language and literature course, although the focus remained more on the teaching of English as a communication skill rather than a cultural art form to be studied in its own right. This demonstrates the well known idea that league tables and passing exams is more important in the education system than the education itself, neglecting the fact that the study of literature requires and improves the basic literacy skills which are at the heart of governmental policy. In 2008, 37% of the poorest children did not take a literature exam, leading to the belief that the study of literature for an elite, depriving those who are perhaps most in need of the inspiration and applied study that reading literature provides. This conflict between the time and effort it takes to study the classics and the demand for assessment has been around for some time, and despite the repeated calls for change from previous poet laureates Andrew Motion and Michael Morpurgo2 it seems that the education sector does not recognise how beneficial the study of these works is to children. 1: Information on the decline of the study of literature taken from the conversation between Dr. Bethan Marshall and schools minister Diana Johnson on BBC Radio 4 on 17 December 2009 (accessed 05/06/11) [9] 2: Information on the decline of the study of literature taken from the conversation between Dr. Bethan Marshall and schools minister Diana Johnson on BBC Radio 4 on 17 December 2009 (accessed 05/06/11) [9]
Counterpoint:The reason why basic literacy is at the heart of the governmental concern is that it still isn't being taught to a high enough standard. Before being able to enjoy and properly understand the English literary classics a core understanding of how the language works is required. The problem is exemplified by the need to have marks available in all disciplines for the quality of English used in terms of spelling, punctuation and grammar and by the fact that business directors such as Tesco director Lucy Neville-Rolfe still complain of poor standards from school leavers1. Recent findings by the National Literary Trust show that an alarming number - 3 to for out of 10 children between the ages of 11 and 13 own no books at all2. This surely suggests that there is a deeper problem within the education system that means that when children reach their GCSE's they simply are not prepared to tackle the complexities of the classics. 1: Article 'Should spelling and grammar count in exams?', Judy Friedberg, 6 October 2010 (accessed 06/06/11) [7] 2: Statistics for children owning books (accessed 06/06/11) [10]
Point:Despite the obvious positives of teaching a variety of works in literature courses, the time constraints and pressures of constant examination mean that this is often impossible. As the director of The National Association for the Teaching of English Ian McNeilly said: "For a teacher under pressure to deliver results there may be precious little time or inclination to study areas which are not for assessment"1, so in this respect it is essential to ensure a focus on they core classics which are as we have established, regarded as being the best and most engaging way into the study of English. By focusing on the building blocks of English literary thinking, the door is left open for individuals both on their own and with the guidance of teachers to read beyond the classics and build their own interests from these accepted foundations. 1: Calls for change from poet laureates taken from BBC News article 'Literary greats key to English', 30 September 2005 (accessed 06/06/11) [11]
Counterpoint:By exposing children to a prescribed list of canonical works it would surely lessen the amount and diversity of things young people read. The logic of reading great works of the past leading to the desire to read other works (perhaps equally great) operates both ways. Why not allow for a number of variations according to choices by the students - if they are allowed to study and be examined on things they freely choose and enjoy, then surely it will have the same positive effect on their attitude towards literature. The fact that schools are so constrained by infrastructures imposed from above should also point to a more balanced system in which a broader range of topics can be explored, given that for the majority of people, GCSE level will be the furthest they take the study of literature in any form.
Point:We refer to certain works as 'literary classics' because of the recognition they have received from the academic world. This is a process which takes time, but more than ever before there is a widespread awareness and general consensus on what is meant by the term 'classic' in this context. They are chosen because of their individual merits and influences on culture - the most commonly cited single writer being William Shakespeare. He is one of, if not the greatest writer in the English language, so the study of his works is surely essential to anyone learning English for themselves. It is often overstated how much of our current vocabulary we owe to Shakespeare, however the point remains valid that he forms much of the basis for the language we speak and write today1. To not study the his writing, along with that of the other great innovators - Chaucer, Milton and Dickens to name but a few, would deprive people of an understanding and awareness of their own culture, and also inhibit the integration of others into the English language and way of life. This issue is also not limited to the UK, as an article in the Boston Globe suggests that more than half of Americans aged 18 to 24 never read books for pleasure2. It is almost certainly the case that the compulsory study of certain works would change that figure. 1: List of Shakespearean words: Amanda Mabillard 'Words Shakespeare Invented Shakespeare Online'. 20 Aug. 2000 (accessed 06/06/11) [12] 2: Article on the decline of reading: David Mehegan, 'Young people reading a lot less', November 19, 2007 (accessed 06/06/11) [13]
Counterpoint:Although the influence of the literary classics is undeniable, their significance is indeed often overstated. Language by its very nature is constantly changing and evolving both in a biological and cultural sense, and despite the fact that we may still use words invented by Shakespeare today, that does not mean that they necessarily carry the same meaning as they do in the context of his work. As such the teaching of said work is not actually essential to the understanding of the word, or of how to use it in modern contemporary society. In other English speaking countries like America, the classics do not have the same cultural significance or dialectic relevance to their society. Whilst the artistic merit of works such as Shakespeare may still be appreciated in such places, it does not seem right to impose them on people who would otherwise choose not to study them. The decision of worth by the academic world does not make any work by definition interesting, and although it would be undesirable to lose the cultural heritage, the choice of what to study would probably lead to greater interest in the subject, and by extension a greater genuine interest in the influence of these works.
