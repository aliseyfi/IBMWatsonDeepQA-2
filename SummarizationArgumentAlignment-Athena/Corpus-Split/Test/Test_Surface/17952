Point:According to Shell geoscientist Marion King Hubbert, the production rate of a limited resource will follow a roughly symmetrical logistic distribution curve (similar in shape to the bell-curve) based on the limits of exploitability and market pressures. The peak of world oilfield discoveries occurred in 1965 but global energy demands are still rising (wikipedia, Peak Oil). This means we’ll likely hit ‘peak oil’ in the coming decades, after which global oil production will decline rapidly. The effects of this will be devastating: oil prices will rise, global transport chains will fall silent and the use of many other oil-related products, like plastics, in our everyday life will be near impossible.
Counterpoint:The threat of peak oil is exaggerated
Point:The production costs per barrel of oil from oil sands is somewhere between $40 to $80 per barrel, and from oil shales somewhere between $50 to over $100 per barrel (World Energy Outlook 2008, 2008). The International Energy Agency expects oil prices to be around or over $100 per barrel in the coming decade (Medium Term Oil and Gas Markets 2011, 2011), rising to $120 per barrel in 2035 (World Energy Outlook 2011 Factsheet, 2011), this is exactly what should be expected with surging demand for oil while supply does not keep up. Moreover, with technology advancing, the production cost per barrel for unconventional oil is likely to decline even further as fields are developed (Can non-conventional oil fill the gap?, 2009). That means this is a sound investment decision.
Counterpoint:The production costs the International Energy Agency estimates do not include the costs associated with carbon dioxide emissions (World Energy Outlook 2008, 2008) or any other negative externalities. Given the many other ‘externalities’, like pollution and social cost, the actual cost to society of unconventional oil is a lot higher than the monetary cost. Given the estimates the proposition provides for costs provide relatively little profit margin unconventional oil could easily become unviable should the costs of pollution be brought into the costs of production, for example if a carbon tax was imposed.
Point:Currently, global oil supply is dominated by the OPEC-cartel, consisting of countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. In 2010, OPEC-countries held about 80% of the world’s global proven conventional oil reserves, with the bulk of this in the Middle East. This creates a dangerous dependency for all oil-importing countries. Suppose the United States or the European Union would face a serious deterioration in diplomatic relations with the Middle East, after which OPEC would decide to cut oil supplies – the consequences would be dire, as the 1973 oil crisis showed.
Counterpoint:If a nation-state’s energy security works like an investment portfolio, investing in ‘oil’ to diversify from ‘oil’ is not diversification at all, since the two types of oil are assets whose returns correlate. Also, Venezuela, who has the world’s largest proven oil sands deposit, is a member of OPEC, and its leader Hugo Chavez is famously anti-American, so the actual diversification happening is only marginal.
