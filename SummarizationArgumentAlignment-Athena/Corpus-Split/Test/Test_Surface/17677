Point:Abstinence programs teach teenagers how to have meaningful, age-appropriate relationships, and help young people fight the pressure of having sex before they are ready.
Counterpoint:There is little evidence that abstention-only programs delay the initiation of sex. A range of studies have demonstrated that they do not delay the onset of sexual activity or reduce the frequency with which sex occurs once a teenager has become sexually active.
Point:Sex carries with it a multitude of risks and responsibilities. All sex – even protected – has the possibility of leading to STIs or pregnancy, both of which have huge psychological, emotional, and physical impacts. Furthermore, sex can create emotional bonds between individuals which are overwhelming and intense. Young people are simply not emotionally or physically mature enough to take such risks, or accept such responsibilities, and so it is irresponsible to teach anything but abstinence.
Counterpoint:Abstinence is obviously the most effective form of birth control and protection from STIs, but telling students to practice abstinence does not mean that they will. Abstinence should absolutely be emphasized as an important method of staying safe, but teaching it alongside other information about sex and protection is far more responsible than pretending that these things do not exist. Even if young people shouldn’t be having sex (which is not necessarily true), many clearly are (slightly under half of high school students have had sex according to the Kaiser Family Foundation).[1] Consequently, it is better to a) ensure that they have adequate knowledge to stay safe and b) view their teachers as honest and informative, so that they trust their advice and do not simply reject the class as moralizing or irrelevant.
Point:Although most previous evidence supporting abstinence-only education failed to meet high scientific standards, a recent study has presented what the Washington Post calls “the first clear evidence” that abstinence-only education really can work. The federally funded study found that only about a third of 6th and 7th graders receiving abstinence-only education had sex over the following two years, whereas nearly half of 6th and 7th graders attending other classes became sexually active.[1] And, abstinence-only education did not affect condom usage[2] ) (confirming what the Mathematica Policy Research study cited by the Opposition also found![3]). This suggests that good abstinence-only programs (this one, for example, did not condemn condoms) implemented at a young age, do have real effects on young people’s sexual activity.
Counterpoint:First, the program in this study was not a typical abstinence-only program; for example it did not encourage delaying sex until marriage.[1] Second, the vast majority of evidence still suggests that these programs do not work, as the Washington Post concedes when they call this study "the first clear evidence." For example, an eight year study by the Mathematica Policy Research Inc. found that there is no evidence that abstinence-only programs reduce the rate of sexual activity among young people.[2] Furthermore, it is not clear that these programs have any significant impact on pregnancy or STI rates. For example, a 2007 study found that abstinence-only programs do not affect the risk of HIV infection in high income countries.[3] See Opp Argument 2 for more detail on how sex-ed does a better job at reducing pregnancy rates, particularly because it teaches students how to properly use condoms.
Point:Given that cultural and social attitudes towards sex are so variable, it should be up to the family to decide how to broach this sensitive topic. Schools are supposed to give students the skills and knowledge they need for employment and/or higher education: sex education is a separate, much more personal, issue. Telling students to abstain ensures that no one is taught anything more than their parents want, and leaves room for parents to give a more extensive education if they so desire. This is especially true since most parents support abstinence education anyway: A Zogby International poll of U.S. parents found that 78% of parents think sex education classes in public schools should place more emphasis on promoting abstinence than on condom and other contraceptive use.[1]
Counterpoint:First, to clarify, while the poll found that 78% of parents think sex education classes should place more emphasis on abstinence, it also found that more parents would rather their children were enrolled in comprehensive sex education courses than in abstinence education courses.[1] But more importantly, the problem with relying on parents to teach their children essential sexual information is that many children do not have parents, or responsible ones. These children need a holistic education more than anyone, and it is unfair to prevent them from learning about sex just because they have no one willing to talk to them about it. Furthermore, schools are meant to prepare students not only academically, but also socially: sending students into the world with no knowledge about sex is irresponsible both to the students, who are may be unprepared for a very large part of their lives, and to society, which must deal with an uneducated and consequently at-risk population. Cultural attitudes aside, there are some medical facts students need to know. See Opp Argument 3 for more detail.
Point:Monogamous sex is much safer than polygamous sex, as it reduces the chance of obtaining and spreading STIs. Furthermore, sex outside of marriage makes it more difficult to develop intimate and trusting relationships. Random sexual partners who are unsure of each other’s fidelity cannot develop the same type of unique and personal relationship that a committed couple can. Numerous studies have shown that this is the case; having more partners increases the STD risk.[1] And, sex before marriage goes against cultural and religious principles. Abstinence education rightly teaches teenagers that saving sex for marriage is the best way to be healthful and happy.
Counterpoint:Non-marital sex is not wrong. If two consenting individuals wish to have sex, and feel that they would be made happier by the experience, there is no reason to deny them that right. Furthermore, so long as individuals use protection and get tested for STIs (both measures that sex-ed encourages) they should not be significantly more at-risk than committed couples.
