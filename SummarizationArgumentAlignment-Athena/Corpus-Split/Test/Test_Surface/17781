Point:States can legally acquire the capacity to build a nuclear bomb and then withdraw from the treaty. The essential problem is that uranium and plutonium are used as fuel for both nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs. The processes by which these materials are manufactured (uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing) are permitted because they have legitimate applications in civilian nuclear programs. On its website it is stated: “the IAEA verifies through its inspection system that States comply with their commitments, under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and other non-proliferation agreements, to use nuclear material and facilities only for peaceful purposes.” [1] Providing a state 'plays along' with the IAEA and allows inspections, it can legally acquire these technologies. Then, once it is in a position to produce material suitable for use in a weapon, it can simply leave the NPT. All a state then has to do to leave the NPT is give 6 months’ notice; the IAEA is then left powerless. Indeed, this is precisely what North Korea did, and what it is feared that Iran will do. North Korea is known to have reprocessing technology (and it probably has an enrichment capability too). In 2003 it withdrew from the NPT (following the breakdown of an agreement with the US) placing its facilities out of the reach of the IAEA. Although international law has succeeded in preventing proliferation in some cases, its 'optional' nature means that to be truly effective it must sometimes be bolstered by American unilateral action.
Counterpoint:It is not a loophole to allow states to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Many states have energy supply problems and nuclear is often a necessary part of the energy mix. It may be true that the IAEA does not move as quickly as the USA would like but there are advantages to its careful, meticulous approach. First, this approach ensures that the IAEA does not make false accusations. As the United States found out recently in Iraq, assessing the state of a WMD program is a tricky exercise and mistakes can be costly. Second, the IAEA's approach allows for a gradual build-up of international pressure. It is unrealistic to expect immediate agreement from the entire international community about the need to deal with a potential proliferator. By carefully acquiring and presenting evidence the IAEA can gradually build up international support. This process also leads to an increase of pressure on the potential proliferator and hence the chance of a peaceful solution.
Point:The IAEA's approach to non-proliferation (monitoring nuclear facilities) focuses, almost entirely, on what is known as the demand side. America can supplement this with a counter-proliferation strategy that focuses on preventing supply. A US-led coalition has, for example, started the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)[1]. States within the PSI have agreed to share intelligence about unlawful shipments of nuclear materials and then intercept these cargoes at sea. This strategy enables the US to prevent proliferation to organizations which are outside of the IAEA's reach, namely terrorist organizations and states which are not party to, or ignore, the NPT. Although exact details are kept secret, a number of illegal shipments have been stopped and seized under PSI. A second example of America's supply-side approach is the proposal to stop the spread of reprocessing and enrichment.[2] Clearly, preventing potential proliferators from buying the technology to produce nuclear weapons in the first place is a more effective strategy than monitoring it once it is in the hands of states which may abuse it.
Counterpoint:The US strategy of preventing proliferation on the supply side is flawed for two reasons: it doesn't work and simultaneously undermines more effective demand-side efforts. America's attempts to halt the spread of reprocessing and enrichment are doomed to failure because it cannot convince other nations to do the same. In 2004 President Bush approached the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and asked its member states not to export reprocessing and enrichment facilities to states which do already possess them. The NSG refused, effectively ruining the President's plan - without the support of every nation that already these technologies he cannot hope to prevent their further spread. However, even if he had got the agreement of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, there would still be the problem of preventing states from developing this technology themselves without help.
Point:Unlike the IAEA, the USA is able to take fast, decisive action against a potential proliferator. In contrast, the United States can act quickly and decisively. Quickly because there is usually consensus between the President and Congress about proliferation issues. Decisively because of the massive diplomatic, economic and, in extreme cases, military power at the USA's disposal. This power can not only be used to stop a potential proliferator in its tracks but is also an effective deterrent to states trying to go nuclear. In an example, the US was able to take decisive action in Kosovo when the rest of the world was dealing with bureaucracy, instead of helping the people there.
Counterpoint:Apart from the lack of checks and balances associated with US unilateral action, the threat of such action is unlikely to prevent proliferation. Rather it will encourage other states to try and acquire nuclear weapons as a counterweight to the US. Those states that are currently in the process of acquiring nuclear weapons (Iran and North Korea) are doing so precisely because they are the only effective means of deterring US conventional power. Were the USA to stop acting outside of the IAEA, international efforts to curb Iranian and North Korean weapons programs would likely be much more effective.
