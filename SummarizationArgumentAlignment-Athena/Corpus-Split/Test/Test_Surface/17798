Point:Having children is such an important aspect of most people’s lives that it should be considered a right. For many people, their status as parents is a key part of their identity, and their devotion towards their children is indicative of how important parenting is to them. The right to start a family is recognized in article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights and article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Counterpoint:The state gives every human being the “right to reproduce”, which is not equal with a right to become a parent by all means.
Point:If the state funded IVF treatment, it would overcome some of the inefficiencies involved in expensive medical treatment. Costs would be brought down as economies of scale are exploited, and state health services have better bargaining power when it comes to purchasing large orders of drugs and equipment. A higher rate of treatment within the population would increase safety and improve outcomes (thus reducing costs), as medical departments become more experienced. Most significantly, an asymmetry of information exists between doctor and patient (as it does with all medical treatment) – patients are not aware of what services they need, and are unable to weigh up the various options available to them, because doing so requires medical training. This drives up prices, as doctors have incentives to ‘over treat’ patients, and not to treat patients in the most cost-effective manner. Providing state funding would make the state the purchaser of IVF services (or even the direct provider of them), removing either the ability to over treat or the incentive to do so (depending on whether the state is the buyer or the provider).
Counterpoint:The state could reduce the cost of all kinds of goods and services by using its market power to drive down prices. There are even other (non-medical) services that suffer from the asymmetry of information problem described by the proposition, such as car maintenance, audio-visual equipment, and health foods/supplements. Nobody advocates the state intervening in these markets, so what is special about healthcare?
Point:Most couples which decide to do IVF treatments do not have unlimited funds available to them. Therefore, once they decide to do IVF treatments in order to reduce the costs of more cycles, couples and clinicians (with only private funds) typically opt to implant numerous embryos, hoping at least one will survive.
Counterpoint:Such practices as implanting more embryos, knowing it could lead to complications and more health issues for the patients is immoral regardless if in private of public sector. Under the Hippocratic Oath physicians should any way stick to the principle of “First, do no harm.”[1]The problem of the multiple implants can be very easily solved by putting new legislation in place that would forbid more embryos at the same time and in this way make procedures safer for the patients in the private and publically funded sector.
Point:There are benefits to the state in promoting fertility treatments and so encouraging more people to have children. Most developed countries have rapidly aging populations with too few young people to be able to maintain their pensions systems over the next thirty years. To avert demographic crisis governments need to do more to encourage couples to start families. Many states already support couples who have children through the benefits system; some like Italy even pay a lump sum to couples on the birth of each child. Funding IVF to increase the number of births is an obvious extension of this principle. It would also be right for society through the state to fund IVF, as career expectations and the high costs of housing force many couples now delay starting a family until they are in their thirties, by which time they may need medical help to conceive.
Counterpoint:Although individual countries may have demographic problems, overall the world needs to restrain population growth. There is something hypocritical about developed countries encouraging poor ones to promote family planning and smaller families, while funding IVF to increase the number of births at home. Ultimately richer countries will have to be more open to immigration if they want to fix their demographic problems. In any case, providing IVF will make no significant impact on the actual birth rate in developed countries, but will impose high medical costs on the state.
