Point:Cultural heritage is often very important to people, particularly to new immigrants who are already feeling the loss of their old ways of life. It is a matter of luck whether we are born in a country with lots of opportunities, or are forced to travel if we wish to seek a better life. As such, we should not penalise such unfortunate people but rather allow them to continue to practice important cultural practices. Britain has introduced support for a number of non-Christian faith schools that both respect and encourage the faiths and cultures of its students, many of whom are first or second-generation immigrants.1
Counterpoint:It may well be arbitrary where we are born, but that does not make it any less true: we make distinctions between citizens of one country and another country for practical purposes, and states have primary duties to their own citizens first and foremost. People in the host country also have a right to the preservation of their culture, and therefore if necessary incomers should integrate, and give up their cultural practices as the price paid for the benefits migration.
Point:Assimilation expects immigrants to shed their cultural heritage It is expected that recent immigrants to a country will shed major parts of their cultures and values to adapt to those of the host country. But, this is unrealistic. Nobody will quickly shed and adopt the new cultural elements of a nation; a major flaw of the assimilation model. For example, America, often used as the prime example of assimilation, is not the melting pot once thought. America is a land of many cultures, where important and sustained cultural divisions between Americans persist. Assimilationist doctrine claims it is working towards a sense of one American-ness, but there are two problems with this notion. One, America is a land built on democratic difference – very different political groups can and do exist. Two, American assimilation has had a troubling history consisting of a dominating, white power structure aiming to restrict extending American citizen to all citizens, and denying human rights to all citizens (often because of race or skin colour).
Counterpoint:Immigrants demonstrate their own willingness to integrate in their (often) strenuous efforts to reach their destination. In America, where thousands of migrants have fled over the last century, the assimilation process is a proven success. It is one of the most successful societies and economies in the world. It enjoys relative peace, cohesion, and civic engagement among its various groups – it’s two main political parties disagree often but agree on the fundamental freedoms of the American citizen. Furthermore, the success of the assimilation model is found in the civil rights movement that ultimately led to the election of Barack Obama in 2009. Such a compelling empirical example of assimilation is hard to compete with.
Point:Allowing people to preserve their own cultures allows other people to understand different cultural practices and ways of living life. This exposure to new experiences enriches the cultural practices of all: we are better able to make choices about the way in which we wish to live our lives, whether that is a matter of what food we eat or what religion we practice. The Amish community in rural America is just one example; 'it is not necessary to live an Amish life to appreciate what they can teach us', the mere knowledge that one can be happy without constant access to life's modern technologies is a humbling thought.1
Counterpoint:In reality, multiculturalism is a form of segregation: cultural practices will not diffuse across the artificial borders, because people view the two communities as very distinct. That is, they view the cultural practices of other communities as something "they" rather than "we" do. True diversity is achieved through integration: even when people integrate they retain some of their cultural practices, and these can be experienced by others as something their friends do, rather than something a whole separate community does.
Point:Neither the state nor the majority or host community has a monopoly on the knowledge of the best way to live life. As such, we each have to seek out this "good life" for ourselves; it varies depending on our individual values and priorities.
Counterpoint:There are some wrong ways to live life, and the rhetoric of multiculturalism makes it harder for the law to intervene when things go too far: we are forced to step back in the name of tolerance.
