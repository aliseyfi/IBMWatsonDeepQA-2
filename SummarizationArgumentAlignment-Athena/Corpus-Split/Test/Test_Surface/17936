Point:Outing gay celebrities puts the fight for gay equality in the fore of political discussion by removing the capacity for opposition to pass it off as a “minority” problem that is not of utmost concern.
Counterpoint:The discussion will not be about gay rights or the prevalence of gay people in respected industries, but rather will be able the ethical nature of having “outed” them in the first place. This doesn’t give any political weight to movement, it only demonizes the people who have outed them and allows the opposition to the movement to point to the fact that these gay celebrities wanted to remain closeted as a reason to believe that it is weird and wrong.
Point:Celebrities are uniquely placed to help break down misunderstanding and prejudice against the gay community.
Counterpoint:Although this may be the case for some people in society, you will not reach the most vehement opposition to gay rights with this tactic. The people who pose the most threat to the gay rights movement are those who have prejudices that are so deeply entrenched either socially or religiously that this will not foster a deeper understanding, but rather a rejection of these celebrities as weird and immoral just like “all the rest” of the gay community[1]. The only people you actually reach with this policy are those who are open to being persuaded on the issue as it is, and therefore, you gain no extra benefit from approaching the issue this way.
Point:Celebrities have a special obligation to society because their success and lives are directly created and maintained by society.
Counterpoint:Celebrities are in no way more indebted to society than any other person who is dependent on society for everything from their education through to their employment and every single aspect of their lives. Moreover, this argument is dependent on there being a massive benefit to society, which is disputable. Celebrities do not have an obligation to martyr themselves for the causes of any person in society who can demonstrate the potential benefit of their cause.
