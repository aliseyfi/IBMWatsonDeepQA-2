Point:Refusing to prescribe contraceptives for girls below the age of consent assumes that no under-age girls can make an informed decision to choose a sexual relationship. Medical advice and prescriptions should be given on an individual, rather than uniform, basis. As long as these girls meet the requirements for consent laid out by the relevant medical authority, there should be no reason for contraceptives should be denied to them. The decision of whether an individual is ready to engage in a sexual relationship is a purely personal one; refusing contraceptives places them at unnecessarily medical risk, both physically and mentally, and does not adhere to the duty of care by doctors for their patients[1].
Counterpoint:We have to place a limit somewhere. Though some children might be emotionally mature enough for sex at the age of 12 or 13, it is also destructive to imply that they all are. It can be very difficult to gauge whether a young girl ‘has genuinely understood’ the true consequences of her contraception, and giving routine prescriptions to under-age girls could give fuel to peer-pressure[1] as there is now no medical obstacle why the girl can refuse sex. ‘Informed consent’ is very difficult to gauge accurately, and the potential to misidentify a vulnerable girl who is being coerced as a girl who is fully informed could carry enormous consequences and fail to care for the best medical interests of the patient.
Point:Although it is almost impossible to absolutely prevent underage sex, as already shown by rising teen pregnancy rates in the US, the UK and across Europe[1][2], it is possible to encourage safe sex. Sex education programmes which teach abstinence rarely seem to deter sexual activity or prevent teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections[3]. However, studies researching the effect of providing contraceptives in schools have found that there was ‘no increase in sexual activity’[4]. If this principle was extended to include the many different types of contraception available by prescription, this could feasibly help to lower high teenage pregnancy rates; for example, the prescribed pill has a higher efficiency rate than condoms, which are often available in schools or clinics[5] but used inefficiently[6]. Devices like the IUD also remove any problems of girls forgetting to take their pills on time. [7] Allowing under-age girls to be able to talk to a doctor and receive the form of contraception which is best fitting for them[8] would actively tackle rising teen pregnancy rates.
Counterpoint:It is very difficult to gather accurate information over whether increased availability of contraception does or does not lead to increased sexual activity. However, the gesture of allowing underage girls to receive prescription from doctors is dangerous in principle. It represents the "systematic removal of every restraint that used to act as a disincentive to under-age sex"[1], and undermines the laws currently in place. Even if this does not have an immediate, visible, short-term effect on teen sexual activity, it may well lead to a disregard towards the need for emotional maturity in sex over the long-term.
Point:The decision to have sex is an incredibly subjective one. Some girls might be ready at 13, others may not be ready until they are in their twenties or older. In fact, the age where girls enter puberty has become progressively younger; so, whereas 11 might be considered an average age to begin puberty, some girls can begin puberty as young as 7 years old[1]. However, in either case or early or of late development, the subjective decision of sexual maturity should not be permitted or outlawed by a system which takes no personal account of the individual; the only person who can judge if they are ready is the girl herself.
Counterpoint:Society frequently limits independent choice when there is a risk of harm to that individual or others. This is particularly true of young people because society recognises that these choices are not fully informed, reasoned, or rational at such a young age. This is also why you must reach a certain age to make decisions with substantial consequences such as getting married[1][2] or joining the army[3][4]. In cases such as these, where young girls’ bodies are still developing or they have just begun romantic relationships, they may not wholly understand their situation or the consequences and so cannot make a fully informed decision. This is even more evident if the girl would otherwise have unprotected sex rather than wait or use condoms, at physical and psychological risk to herself. It shows that they underestimate or misinterpret the long-term consequences of their actions.
Point:Disallowing doctors to prescribe contraceptives to young girls impedes their duties of medical ethics. The principle of beneficence instructs that doctors should do good for their patients[1]. If a young girl is in danger of an unplanned pregnancy and the potential medical complications which accompany it, a doctor should not deny her help if she asks for it and is medically suitable for the contraceptives. For example, she must be within the parameters for weight and blood pressure to take the combined pill, without undue likelihood of blood clots and other potential risks[2]. It is contradictory to give doctors the right to judge their patient’s best interests, but simultaneously prevent them from acting in their professional capacity.
Counterpoint:Medical ethics and the law clash here. Another important cornerstone of medical ethics is autonomy[1], which requires that the patient must be able to make a fully informed decision – something which might be compromised by her potential lack of maturity at a young age. It is particularly important that medical autonomy excludes ‘coercion or coaxing’[2] – this is placed in jeopardy from the risk of teenage peer pressure[3]. However, there is nothing to prevent a young girl from simply speaking to a doctor about her concerns, which would also fulfil the doctor’s ethical duty. Doctors must also operate within the boundaries of the law; if this motion was passed, the principles of law would be violated instead. This motion can only replace one negative effect – potential unprotected sex – with another, breaking the law. It is not a satisfactory solution.
Point:By visiting the doctor, young girls have more access to information which they might not get from their school sex education. Given that, in the United States, there is ‘no federal mandate to teach sex education’ in public schools, and ‘less than half of all public schools . . . offer information on how to obtain birth control’[1], it is patently clear that the current educational system fails to address the needs of young adolescents in this respect. A doctor’s surgery or clinic is a more private environment for young girls to ask for clarification, without intimidation from male or female peers[2], which encourages education and makes sure that the girls are more fully informed before they have sex.
Counterpoint:This is an argument to improve sex education, rather than to rely on doctors to provide outside information. If the school system of sex education is not working, then it should be improved, rather than diverting young girls elsewhere to try and find information. Furthermore, other methods of contraception are more easily available, such as condoms at drop-in clinics in the UK[1]. Speaking directly to a doctor, and requiring them to professionally sanction this underage sexual behaviour, is not the only way to obtain contraception.
