Point:Every state has a right to shape its own destiny and that of its people. It must therefore have control over its defense policy, which necessarily shape its interactions with other states. The Japanese constitution contains a clause, forced into it by the American occupiers, denying Japan the power to develop a military of its own. The ironic thing is that the United States military now claims to be doing Japan a favor by retaining its bases, claiming that because they have no military they cannot defend themselves. With the United States military gone, Japan will be able to begin reconsidering its defense policy and to shape it in the image it sees as befitting itself, not how the United States envisions it1. The presence of American troops in lieu of a Japanese military hampers Japan's ability to shape a defense policy on its own terms, instead having to defer to the United States, whose interest might or might not coincide with Japan's. In any event, the Japan Self-Defense Forces are well suited to the task of defending Japan, as it is the sixth largest defense organization by expenditure in the world1. It is not in any real danger of being overwhelmed by aggressors in the absence of American protection. In order to fully take its place on the world stage and to become a full member of the community of free nations, Japan must be able to direct its own defense and foreign policies. This can only truly happen once the United States withdraws its forces from Japan.
Counterpoint:Japan does not need to shape its own military policy, nor does it seem to want to do so. The government could remove the clause in the constitution against building a military, but it has never chosen to do so. The Japanese appear happy enough to let the United States handle its defense, even if they grumble a bit about a few crimes being committed by American soldiers. The Japanese are better off with the United States providing it protection anyway, since it ensures they are safe from harm from other regional players.
Point:The presence of American military personnel is particularly onerous in light of the multitude of crimes committed by soldiers over the years; since the 1950s, more than 200,000 accidents and crimes have been committed, and more than 1000 Japanese civilians have been killed, and a number of others have been the victims of assault and rape1. Most of the soldiers who commit these crimes never see justice since American soldiers stationed in Japan enjoy partial extraterritorial status, granting them a degree of immunity from prosecution by Japanese authorities2. For all of these reasons, the Japanese people have resoundingly stated their desire for the United States to withdraw its forces and close its bases on their soil. This is demonstrated in every opinion poll and is reflected in the fact that current ruling party in the Japanese parliament, the Democratic Party of Japan was elected partly on the basis of its promise to remove the bases. Without reason to be there, and unwanted by the people, the United States should remove its forces from Japan.
Counterpoint:Whether or not the Japanese people want them there or not, it is perfectly legitimate for the United States to maintain military bases in Japan. Simply because they commit some crimes does not mean the American soldiers in Japan are doing more harm than good. In fact, the security they provide Japan, which does not have a full military, is vital in light of potential threats from other East Asian powers, such as North Korea or China1.
Point:The United States may once have had a legitimate reason to maintain a military presence in Japan; it had a genuine interest in instituting a democratic regime and enforcing a peace after the violence of World War II. Yet now, more than fifty years on, Japan is a thriving, robust democracy that has proven it to be a responsible and markedly conservative actor in international relations. The presence of the United States, originally meant to enforce peace, no longer has any place in Japan. Yet it persists, and not only does it keep its bases and soldiers on bases, it also expects the Japanese government to contribute to their upkeep through a special "sympathy budget" levied from the Japanese exchequer each year, which has cost the Japanese taxpayers more than $100 billion since 19871. Clearly, the treatment of the United States of Japan through its maintenance of its forces is illegitimate.
Counterpoint:The United States has the legal legitimacy of the post-war treaty signed by the Japanese government, and ratified when the first independent parliament took power after the military governorship ended. By all legal accounts, the United States has every right to maintain its forces in Japan.
Point:Japan is a nation with a now-ingrained democratic tradition and a strong liberal economic system, which makes it the perfect actor to engage politically with states in East Asia on behalf of the international community, as well as to serve as an example of the benefits of liberal democratic values to a society. Japan can serve as an exemplar to its neighbors still laboring under tyrannical regimes, such as North Korea and Burma (Myanmar) and to help promote an organic progression to democracy in the region. All of these activities are hampered, however, by the presence of American military bases in Japan. When Japan seeks to engage with despotic states and to reach out to their people, tyrants can point to the bases as exemplifying Japan's position as a puppet of the United States and not truly an independent nation at all1. So long as its strings appear to be being pulled by the United States, Japan will unable to effectively promote democracy and liberalism amongst its neighbors. By withdrawing its troops, the United States gains an influential ally in the promotion of views in keeping with its own.
Counterpoint:The removal of American military bases from Japan will not improve perceptions of Japan by its neighbors. This is due to the fact that it is not the presence of the United States in Japan that makes many East Asian states wary of it, but rather Japan's imperial history. China and Korea remember vividly the Japanese invasion of their territory and have in many ways not forgiven them for the atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers during that time. Japan will always be a tainted actor in the region, whether the United States has bases within its borders or not.
Point:The removal of American soldiers from Japan will greatly benefit the United States' efforts in other regions of the world. At present groups opposed to the United States, such as al-Qaeda, use Japan as an example of American imperialism; they point out that when the United States build a military base, they rarely vacate it1. This has led to reticence on the part of countries such as Pakistan to ask for American aid in fighting terrorists within its borders and to terrorist organizations being able to recruit soldiers fearing subjection to an American empire. Closing its bases in Japan will serve to soften the United States' appearance of empire. It will demonstrate that if a base is placed in a country it will be removed when it is no longer needed or wanted. This makes calling upon the United States for aid appear less costly to a state's sovereignty and makes the presence of American bases elsewhere in the world seem less permanent and odious. All of these perceptual changes will help to further American foreign policy, as it will be met by more compliant, less oppositional states.
Counterpoint:Removing its bases from Japan will do little to improve international perceptions of the United States. The fact that is willing to remove its forces from a state more than fifty years after it has become a stable democracy and only then due to extreme local opposition to their presence is not much of an example to give to the rest of the world. The removal of its bases would be seen as nothing more than a token gesture, and would certainly not be accepted as indicative of a willingness to leave states when they ask it to do so.
Point:The days of large standing armies doing battle with one another are over. Power is not measured by the number of foot soldiers a state has, but by its arsenal of fighters, bombers, drones, and aircraft carriers. The United States has accepted this fact belatedly, choosing to maintain a large standing army while also developing more formidable and useful methods of warfare and projecting power1. However, escalating costs are starting to make this effort to eat its cake and have it too financially impossible. In order to remain the dominant military power in the 21st century, the United States must accept that its military investments must be made more intelligently, and focus on developing smarter weapons, such as unmanned drones, as well as platforms for conducting war in the modern world, such as aircraft carriers. Removing its bases from Japan would be a first step toward reorganizing the military along these more rational lines. The effort to scale back on ground forces must start somewhere, and Japan is as good as any, considering its lack of need for such forces.
Counterpoint:A shift away from conventional ground forces is not a wise strategic move for the United States. Its experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan serve as striking examples of the value of having "boots on the ground"1. Without a conventional ground force, bombers and drones can do little. Rolling back its overall complement of such forces is thus strategically ill advised.
