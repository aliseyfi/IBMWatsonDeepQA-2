Point:Obviously, renewable energy sources must be developed and the way Americans consume energy must be addressed, but that is no reason to ignore an effective part of the solution. Considering the amount of oil that the US currently consumes, 19 million barrels a day, it is both unreasonable and naïve to believe that the US will quit using oil overnight. Oil will need to be phased out slowly, but until then, the US will continue to consume and demand oil. The cost of oil is placing a serious strain on the US economy and on individual household budgets, and every available strategy should be used to combat the problem.
Counterpoint:Offshore drilling is a Band-Aid solution to a more fundamental problem. Oil is a finite resource. The reality is that the United States consumes energy at rates far greater than the growth in supply. Such consumption is not sustainable and must be addressed. Offshore drilling only makes a tiny contribution to the problem of supply, while ignoring the more fundamental problem of US demand. Opening America's coastal waters to offshore drilling only reinforces this misconception and will continue to kick the can down the road instead of gathering support for the long term solutions of renewable energy.
Point:Offshore drilling will lower gas (petroleum) prices. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that offshore drilling could generate 18 billion barrels of crude oil1. While it consumes 18,771,400 barrels of oil every day2. The US consumes huge amounts of oil, and therefore needs to produce more. Greater availability of domestic oil will result in lower gas prices for American consumers. The ban has prevented the US from taking advantage of this known resource. Considering how oil is used in various aspects of American life and industry, high gas prices contribute to economic health. In 2011, gas prices are $4 a gallon and it is thought that these high gas prices jeopardize the economic recovery. Lowering gas prices is therefore essential to improved economic outlook, and therefore offshore drilling should be considered as a viable option.
Counterpoint:The impact of drilling on oil prices will be minimal and will take years to be felt by US consumers. Oil prices are largely set by worldwide supply and demand, with recent rises reflecting increasing energy use in rapidly growing economies such as China. The amount of oil generated from offshore drilling in the US will not impact world oil markets in any significant way1. Additionally, scientists do not know with any certainty how much oil can actually be extracted. Furthermore, oil exploration and rig construction take many years to complete. According to the EIA, offshore drilling would not produce any measurable change in oil prices until 2030.
Point:Even in prosperous economic times, providing jobs and stable growth should be at the forefront of policy maker's minds. Having more money in the government's coffers also never hurts considering that keeping a balanced budget is extremely difficult. Turning down an industry that could promote jobs and tax revenue is therefore unwise, particularly when there are ways to make it safe. 2011 has proven to be one of the harshest American job markets since the 1970s. For that reason, cutting jobs and turning away tax revenue needlessly cannot be justified. It is estimated that the slow permit process for offshore drilling has cost the Gulf area 230,000 jobs and $44 billion including tax revenue1. Since the offshore drilling industry creates jobs and tax revenue--and can be executed without jeopardizing the environment—then it is a viable option for investment and should be pursued.
Counterpoint:Obama promised $150 billion to create 5 million jobs in the green industry over the next 10 years. The green and renewable energy industry is just developing and therefore promises employment for years to come, whereas the jobs offered from the offshore drilling industry are finite, like the resource itself1.
Point:Drilling will decrease US dependency on foreign oil and will make America safer. Currently the United States must buy most of its oil from authoritarian and often hostile states such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran, or from unstable places like Nigeria. 22% of US oil comes from the Middle East, 22% from Africa, and 19% from Latin America1. It is estimated that the oil in offshore reserves could supply US energy needs for two years. When problems occur in these unstable energy producing countries, it often causes oil prices to rise, and the US has no way of avoiding these consequences. Oil prices increased when the crisis in Libya ensued2. Additionally, the US loses leverage over many international actors as its hands are tied due to dependence on oil, this is the case with nuclear proliferation in Iran for example. Offshore drilling and increased energy independence could help distance America from anti-democratic regimes and the impact of unrest in these unstable nations.
Counterpoint:Offshore drilling will not make the US safer or more energy independent. While America only has 3% of the world's oil reserves, it consumes 19% of the global oil supply. The US doesn't have enough oil to meet its demand. Even if the EIA estimates are correct, offshore reserves will have little impact and the US will have to continue buying oil from potentially unfriendly nations for years to come. The only path to true energy independence and greater national security is to decrease American energy consumption and to invest in homegrown renewable energy.
