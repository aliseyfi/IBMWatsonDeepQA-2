Point:Western liberal democratic economies are no longer able to rely on large scale manufacturing, natural resources extraction, shipping or heavy industry to provide jobs and growth. The creation of knowledge and service economies and the movement of mining and manufacturing activities to the developing world mean that the economies of Europe, the United Kingdom and America are now driven by innovation and research. Western economies are reliant on the creation of new forms of product and service and the refinement of existing ones.
Counterpoint:The existence of Chapter 11 protections incentivises excessive risk taking within businesses. Risks taken on investing in the creation of new products, in expanding a business’s operations or diversifying the services it offers all incur large amounts of debt – research and expansion need to be funded, after all. Taking on too much risk can produce an excess of debt with no guarantee that it will be serviceable.
Point:Chapter 11 encourages a sober, measured approach to corporate planning. The onerous results of a European-style bankruptcy encourage businesses to avoid negotiating with their creditors when their debts become unmanageable. Chapter 11 protection has always been awarded on a discretionary basis. A bankruptcy judge will only allow a company to continue trading as a going concern if he is satisfied that its failure to meet its debts was not caused by poor or corrupt management or by excessive and reckless risk taking. Further, the creditors and stockholders of a firm making a chapter 11 filing must agree on any recovery plan that its owners and operators put forward, and are given the opportunity to alter and amend the strategy that the company will use to return to solvency.
Counterpoint:Far from encouraging sobriety and forward planning among a business’s executive class, strategic bankruptcy is often used to coerce stakeholders in a company into accepting unpopular or flawed decisions[i].
Point:Chapter 11 can help to protect the interests of both creditors and a business’s other stakeholders, such as employees, suppliers and pension schemes. Traditional processes of liquidation are designed to quickly wind up a company while disposing of its assets in as profitable a fashion as possible. This, inevitably, results in job losses and may also lead to the collapse of pension funds. There may also be any number of small suppliers who are reliant on a bankrupt company’s business who may be adversely affected by the decision to liquidate.
Counterpoint:Shareholders interests do not receive sufficient protection under the Chapter 11 regime. Stockholders usually rank last in the order of priorities for repaying those with a financial stake in a company, and this is no different under Chapter 11.
