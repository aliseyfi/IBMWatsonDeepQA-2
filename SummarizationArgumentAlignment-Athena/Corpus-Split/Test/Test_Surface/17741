Point:Providing condoms to students in public education programs will reduce the incidence of underage pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. If one accepts the premise that condoms are an effective means of prevention, it stands to reason that their distribution could have a significant impact.
Counterpoint:Condom use by Children is not a sure fire way of preventing the harms Proposition have outlined. Condoms can be ineffective, leading to the spread of STIs and teenage pregnancy.
Point:Many young girls feel pressured into sex before they are ready. This pressure is from various sources; friends, boyfriends and the melange of mixed messages and highly sexualised role models communicated to them by the media. [3] Girls growing are encouraged to be sexual beings and may feel they have no control over their own bodies.
Counterpoint:Girls who feel pressured into sex will feel even more so if given condoms to them by their teacher. Children see teachers as figures of authority, and can easily take the message that having sex so young is a good thing, causing the problems that Proposition want to prevent.
Point:As highlighted earlier, Condom Distribution can counter harms such as STIs and Teenage Pregnancy. It also can provide an educational benefit. By providing teenagers with frank, straightforward information about both sex and condoms young people will be much more likely to understand when they are ready to have sex. They will also be much more confident in rejecting unwanted advances and avoiding reckless or risky sexual encounters.
Counterpoint:Education about sex simply promotes it as something pleasurable and risk-free, without fully communicating its potential to cause harm. Giving children condoms further promotes sex without full consideration for its harms. Children may get poor information about sex, but giving children condoms only exacerbates the problem. Condom distribution tells children that sex is something that should be done, obscuring the serious message at the heart of sex education. This makes attempts to cut through the cacophony of noise in popular culture that pressures children into sex more difficult.
