Point:In a democratic society the people are the ultimate arbiters of government policy and action. We are free to remove and replace all levels of government on a regular basis.
Counterpoint:The idea that government is at the control of the people might be fine for a civics class, in practice it is really not. The elected component of the government is relatively small and in terms of those points at which government enters into most people’s lives on a daily basis, it is not known for its obedience to the will of the people.
Point:The idea that free markets make for free people becomes derisible the moment you look outside the West. In the developing world unfettered corporations routinely act again the interests and wishes of the people. From the privatisation of natural resources in Latin America and Africa to undermining the prices charged by indigenous farmers the world over. Even Russia, the poster child of the Reagan revolution is now controlled jointly by a dictator and a handful of oligarchs.
Counterpoint:Free markets allow people to see the opportunities available in the free world. The capacity to buy and sell, to freely trade allows people to realise that they are not at the beck and call of anybody. Added to that, the Market acts as the ultimate arbiter. It follows the choices of individuals and, therefore, makes them supreme. It has no time for the idea that there is only one way to do things or that a consumer should make a choice because they are told to. It only appeals to the views people express trough their choices in buying products and giving their labour. It is the very definition of freedom.
Point:Although there are areas of government that we, the people, accept must be kept secret (such as security), the vast bulk of government activity is open to scrutiny. Where it is not we and our elected representatives have the tools to find out why. The United States for example has the Freedom of Information Act.[i] Corporations, by their nature, have to be secretive, they have an interest in their customers and competitors not knowing how they have, or plan to have, a market advantage. They tend not to want their customers to know how much of a product or service’s price is profit and so forth.
Counterpoint:This is simply not true. Anyone who has ever tried to get concrete and meaningful information out of a government agency knows that this is untrue. Even in many western democracies there is no guarantee of transparency in government, in France Former President Mitterrand was able to keep it secret that he had cancer.[i]
