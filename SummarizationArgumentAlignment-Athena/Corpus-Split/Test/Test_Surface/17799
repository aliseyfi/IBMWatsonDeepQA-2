Point:It is practically unfeasible for the government to continue imprisoning people at this rate when prisons are already over capacity[1][2]. Sooner or later, we will have to accept that there is too great a burden on our prison facilities for this kind of sentencing to continue being used in so many cases. As such, we should give priority to imprisoning criminals who are genuinely dangerous and who have proved their violent tendencies already. These kinds of offences are the most traumatic for victims[3] and we owe it to them to make sure that these criminals are physically distanced from the rest of society. However, while non-violent offenders have also committed a crime, they do not pose the same kind of danger which requires that they must be locked up; in fact, those who commit small-scale crimes against society could be better rehabilitated by being forced to work to improve society through things like community service – they will be less likely to damage a society which they feel a part of and have helped to build[4]. When people hold a greater stake in their community, they value it more and are reluctant to damage it[5].
Counterpoint:Allowing ‘non-violent’ offenders to walk free is not the only option we have in the face of an overstretched prison system. For a start, we could just build more prisons. The potential cost of this, however great, is less damaging to society than allowing powerful drug dealers or fraudsters to continue undermining the law and intimidating citizens is they are allowed to move freely within society. Measures such as curfews still allow these criminals to move freely through society for a large proportion of the day[1], during which there remains little to deter them from continuing criminal activities, especially when the punishment they have already received has been so lenient. In cases of electronic tagging, even if the curfew is breached, the first instance incurs only a warning[2]. This is too lenient for people who have broken the law.
Point:Those who advocate prison sentences for non-violent offenders often state two points: first, that the idea of being sent to prison is thought to act as a deterrent, and prevent people from committing crimes; second, that people have do commit crimes and go to prison are less likely to re-offend. This is false on both counts. The idea of prison as a deterrent is immediately disproved by a rising violent crime rate[1][2], and the argument that these prisoners will not re-offend is disproved by the high rate of re-offending after a prison sentence, reaching up to 70% for some prisons[3][4]. Moreover, re-offending statistics are normally only based on crimes committed within a year of release[5]; there may be many, many more ex-prisoners who re-offend who are not recorded within these statistics. Crimes which are committed impulsively and without forethought are rarely deterred by the possibility of punishment or being caught[6].
Counterpoint:This argument is weakened by the fact that it is often violent criminals who have high rates of recidivism[1], in which case this mechanism would have placed them in prison anyway. While impulsive crimes such as petty theft might not be deterred by the prospect of a prison sentence, highly organised and long-term crimes such as fraud and drug offences might well find prison to be a deterrent – in fact, one of the reasons that drug crime is particularly prevalent is that the number of drug arrests is ‘comparatively low in many countries in relation to the total number of users’[2]. If arrest and sentencing were a more constant threat to these crimes, instead of a distant and unlikely chance, prison could become a true deterrent to crimes of this nature.
Point:Sentencers have a wide array of options in their sentencing, and indeed the sentencing council states that sentencing should ‘never be a rigid, mechanistic or scientific process’[1]. They have the option to make sentences more proportional to the crimes committed, and it is logical that the more serious crimes should receive the most serious sentences – in this case, imprisonment[2]. Other options for sentencing could include fines, unpaid work, rehabilitation programmes, alcohol or drug treatments, curfews and supervision requirements[3]. One key aim of sentencing is to convey moral censure, and to encourage offenders to truly consider the implications of their actions[4]. However, offenders who feel that they have been punished too severely or treated unfairly, or that those who have committed worse crimes receive the same sentence, are less likely to respond to that moral message and benefit from it[5]. This subsequently damages a key pillar of the criminal justice system – the idea of rehabilitation[6]. Criminals who see themselves as unfairly treated by society have no reason not to strike out against society again by committing another crime. Not only would alternative forms of punishment prevent this from happening, but it does not require the availability of prison and so is less of a burden on resources. Heavier fines, longer community sentences and more strict curfews can easily be given as an appropriate sentence for non-violent offenders.
Counterpoint:Any moral message which sentencing is intended to convey also becomes lost when the sentences are too lenient. Just because a crime in non-violent doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly serious. Large-scale fraud or drug offenses are capable of seriously affecting society; perhaps not by direct physical violence, but more subtly, perhaps by making a particular neighbourhood unsafe because of the prominence of drugs[1], or damaging a family’s ability to sustain itself by cheating them out of money[2]. Certainly, if drug trafficking causes people to become tempted into drugs and subsequently addicted, it can cause an enormous physical harm to that individual[3]. These crimes also damage society by flaunting the rule of law and undermining laws which are put in place for society’s protection. Though these crimes may not be directly physically violent, they should not be underestimated; in many cases, crimes such as drug trafficking and fraud require more forethought and planning than a crime of passion such as assault which might be sincerely regretted by the perpetrator.
Point:Merely having a criminal record which states that an individual was imprisoned, rather than given a more productive sentence such as community service, can have enormous implications on that individual’s future employment opportunities[1]. This is particularly pertinent if it is a first offence, committed in a moment of stupidity. Prisons are an isolating factor which separates the offender from their friends and family and distances them even further from the rest of society[2]. This creates a ‘cycle of crime’[3] where the offender’s closest acquaintances are those who they met in prison, rather than a supportive network of family and friends who can help this person to be reintegrated into society. Not only does prison allow prisoners to share criminal ideas[4], but it may also reciprocally validate their illegal actions by creating a sense of camaraderie. This makes rehabilitation, and recognition of society’s moral values, much more difficult. Ultimately, using prison for non-violent offences only introduces the offenders to more serious crimes, and makes it more difficult for the offenders themselves to be reintegrated, and for wider society to reintegrate them.
Counterpoint:Prisons must be an isolating factor because we recognise that crimes are often committed with the help of friends or accomplices, particularly in the case of drug dealing[1]. The offender must be cut off from their associates to prevent these crimes from continuing while they are imprisoned. Furthermore, while prison may create a sense of camaraderie among inmates, it is much more a force for good. This sense of community actually makes it easier for them to reintegrate into society[2], while sharing ideas stops the sense of personal isolation from the rest of the world[3]. Prison provides both a punishment for the crime committed an the first steps of rehabilitation by giving prisoners a sense of community.
