Point:If it is logically possible for a necessary being (i.e. God) to exist, then it exists. Whatever one clearly and distinctly to be contained in the idea of something is true of that thing. It is clearly and distinctly perceptible that necessary existence is contained in the idea of God. For this reason, God must exist1. One cannot conceive of a God in any context other than one of existence. Clearly, He must exist.1 Malcolm, N. 1960. "Anselm's Ontological Arguments". Philosophical Review 69.
Counterpoint:It is nonsensical to suppose that just because we can mentally visualize something akin to a God that it must exist. Rather, it is clear that the visualization is nothing more than a fantasy until it can be demonstrated 1. Furthermore, it could be that everyone's visualization of God is not of the ultimate being, but only an approximation of the idea, meaning that perhaps the very notion is impossible to conceive at all.1 : Holt, Tim. 2008. "Hume on A Priori Existential Proofs". Philosophy of Religion. [3]
Point:People all over the world believe in God. They believe that a higher power watches over them and guides them, and that they will be rewarded when they die for living good lives on Earth 1. Religion of some kind is a constant in virtually every culture, and there is evidence of religious practice almost as far back as we have evidence for humanity. Faith is its own proof, and the willingness of people to make tremendous sacrifices for their beliefs, even dying for them, demonstrates that they must believe in something that is real.1 Swinburne, Richard. 1997. Is there a God?. Oxford: Oxford University Press.
Counterpoint:Believing in something does not make it real. People once believed that the world is flat, but their belief did not make it so. Faith without reason is ignorance. Furthermore, many people believe in different deities, and many religions have come into and gone out of existence throughout the ages. These religions are often contradictory, and yet their adherents believe them fervently. At best only one of the groups can be wholly right, meaning the others’ beliefs are unfounded. It is more likely that all the beliefs are untrue.
Point:Nature is marked by clear design. The complexity of the human body, of planets, stars, and galaxies, and even of bacteria attests to the existence of creative agency. It is impossible that such things as interdependent species could come to exist without the guidance of God 1. Likewise, certain organisms can be shown to be irreducibly complex, meaning that if one were to remove any part of such an organism, it could not function. This refutes the gradualist argument of evolution, since there is no selective pressure on the organism to change when it is functionless. For example, the bacterial flagellum, the “motor” that powers bacterial cells, loses all functionality if a single component is removed 2. Besides design, the only explanation of its development is blind chance, which seems less sensible, since in human experience nothing complex can come about without agency.
Counterpoint:There is no design in the Universe. People tend to anthropomorphize their environment, trying to assign human-like qualities to animals and nature. All of the complexity in the Universe can be attributed to natural processes; the Universe, stars, and life are all the product of physical and chemical interactions. There is no mystery in the basic process. Furthermore, there are no irreducibly complex organisms. Every example offered by theists of irreducible complexity has been found inaccurate. The bacterial flagellum, for example, when several key components are removed loses its functionality as a motor, but becomes a form of secretory system that has a separate function1. Clearly, complexity is not indicative of a creator.1 Miller, Kenneth. 2004. "The Flagellum Unspun: The Collapse of 'Irreducible Complexity'" in Ruse, Michael and William Dembski (ed.). Debating Design: From Darwin to DNA. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
Point:Throughout the ages many people have claimed that they have observed and spoken with God. All the major religions of the world speak of individuals who have walked with God and derived divine insight. These prophets are the authors and subjects of many holy books, such as the Bible and the Qur’an. The revelations provided in these books can only be the work of God 1. God’s commandments to act morally, God’s philosophical wisdom, is recorded for any doubter to see.
Counterpoint:Virtually every holy book is full of errors. They were often written long after the fact from second and third-hand accounts of the exploits of their subjects. This leads to the development of embellishments and legends, with the supernatural elements of stories always beginning to take precedence once all actual witnesses to events have died. Ancient holy books are nothing more than the moral frameworks of the time in which they were written. They are not transcendent in their wisdom, but very much a part of their time. This is why many of the moral sentiments expressed in such texts as the Bible are not practiced in Western states any longer, because to do so would now be considered morally repugnant. No one in Europe would consider it acceptable, for example, to stone someone to death for working on the Sabbath. Moral sentiment clearly evolves over time1. Holy books and prophets show no divine wisdom, which would have to transcend the time of writing and be applicable always.1 McGinn, C. 1979. "Evolution, Animals, and the Basis of Morality". Inquiry 22: 92-98.
Point:The probability of life beginning on Earth is tiny. The chemical composition of the planet had to be perfect for the development of life, as did its position of orbit around the sun, since if it had been slightly farther away it would have been too cold for life to develop, while it if had been slightly closer, it would have been too hot. Furthermore, the evolution of human beings, with free will and intelligence, was even less likely. Had the universal constants – e.g. gravity, strong and weak forces – been different, the Universe would have been very different, and might well have been unable to sustain life 1. Only through design could the Universe possibly be the way it is, conducive to life on Earth.
Counterpoint:The fact that our planet supports life seems remarkable to us only because we are here to observe it. There are many other planets which do not support life; we just happen to live on one on which the conditions are conducive to life. We do not need to appeal to a divine designer to explain this.
