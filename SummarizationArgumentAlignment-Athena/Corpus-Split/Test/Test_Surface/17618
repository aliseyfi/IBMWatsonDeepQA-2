Point:Water would ideally be a universally accessible and affordable substance, but governments cannot necessarily be trusted to provide water to all of their citizens. 90% of water is publicly provided, yet 1 billion people don't have water1. Clearly this isn't working. Some governments are negligent, and there needs to be a solution to give citizens access to clean water without government provision. This problem has only been exacerbated by the shrinking budgets of most countries due to the economic crisis of 2009. Current regimes in developing countries often provide a state subsidy to the rich, with water provided to middle-class areas and wealthy farmers at a fraction of its true cost, while poorer areas have no supply at all2. Many governments are unfair to the poor, but private providers have no reason to pick favorites. The poor are already paying for their water, either directly to entrepreneurs who carry it in tubs and cans up to the shanty towns, or with their time as they spend a large proportion of the family's labor fetching poor quality water from miles away3. Water privatization will charge for water, however it will be more fair to the poor and provide them with more options to accessing water that the government is not providing. It is difficult to force governments to improve water access, but companies and Public-Private Partnerships (where private companies pay for most of the infrastructure, but partner with public entities) can be used to achieve this goal.1 Economist (2003), "Private Passions", Economist Magazine, [Accessed July 11, 2011] [4]2 Asian Water Supplies Chapter 11, "Tariffs, Subsidies, and Development Funding", [Accessed July 11, 2011] [5]3 Bosch, Christophe, Hommann, Kirsten, Rubio, Gloria M., Sadoff, Claudia and Travers, Lee (2001), "Water, Sanitation and Poverty", Intussen,[Accessed July 11, 2011] [6]
Counterpoint:Governments can be pushed to take action to provide their people with water. Water is such an important part of life that it is unlikely that a government can ignore the issue, if its people do not have access to clean water. The World Bank often ties loans to development in countries including improving water access, and the same stipulations can be associated with aid from individual countries1. There are therefore ways of working with governments and it is not necessary to look to private companies to usurp them.
Point:The goal of the United Nations is to provide more people with clean water; it is irrelevant who provides it as long as it becomes available to more of the world's population. Private public partnerships have proven themselves successful in improving water access around the world. The World Bank conducted a study that estimated that since 1990, PPPs have provided piped water to 24 million people1. Many public utility companies need to start rationing water because of a lack of service continuity. Most poor areas have low pressure and poor pipe infrastructure, and the people have little money to afford wells and pumps that could address the issues that come with rationing1. For this reason the poor are disproportionately affected by rationing. PPPs have been successful in reducing these problems. For example, Colombian private companies have improved service continuity in many cities and towns1. Additionally, clean, quality water must be provided to people, because of the potentially serious consequences of unhealthy water. The desire to make a profit drives companies into remote areas and improves water access for the poor and therefore is a viable option for addressing current water concerns.
Counterpoint:Companies only serve their shareholders and profits. As a result, if a rural a village only has a handful of poor residents, a supply company will probably not build the necessary infrastructure to provide it with water, because the likelihood of the company receiving a return on their investment is low. Since all people need water, and companies have no incentive to provide water to everyone—only those who pay—privatization does not necessarily improve access to water for those in the direst need.
Point:As populations are increasing, demand for water is increasing, but the water available is becoming scarcer. For that reason, using water effectively is integral to sustainably improving access to water around the world. Water simply cannot continue to be wasted. Companies want to be profitable and that means operating at the highest efficiency. The World Bank found that, in Western Africa, Brazil, Colombia, Morocco, and Eastern Manila, private companies have successfully reduced water losses. In some cases, private companies have reduced non-revenue water to just 15%, which is comparable to developed countries’ utilities, which are generally very efficient.1 It is essential that efficiency is reached, and private companies have been shown to improve efficiency through conserving water resources while public companies generally lose efficiency through wasted water. They have also improved labor productivity since managers are trying to run a profitable company and employees need to be effective. Often public utility companies are wasteful and unproductive, which expends valuable resources and actually reduces the number of people water is being made accessible to. Private companies, on the other hand, have tools and expertise for building effectively, which are often unavailable to governments. For example, companies in the Niger Delta were able to get supplies for a fraction of the price that the government paid1. 160 million people have been served by Public-Private projects in the last 15 years and 50 million of them—about one third—are considered successful1. Considering the challenges to providing water, a 1/3 success rate is significant and is the foundation for further improvement. Because efficiency lowers the price of water, saves more water to be distributed, and prevents wasting a valuable resource, privatization is a viable solution.
Counterpoint:Efficiency is not exclusive to private companies and industry. It is not impossible for public utilities to be effective. Both private and public utilities have their drawbacks, but with government oversight and productivity incentives, public utilities can perform with efficiency. This has been proven to be the case, as utilities in many developed countries work just fine. Most Americans are in fact served by publicly owned utilities1. Therefore public does not mean inefficient.
Point:Water is a resource subject to supply and demand, and so should be treated as an economic good. It may fall freely from the skies, but it has to be collected, managed, processed and supplied through an expensive system of reservoirs, channels, processing plants and pipes. Dirty water and human waste also have to be removed and treated in sanitation systems. We pay for food, and shelter, which are both necessary for life, so it is perfectly morally acceptable to pay for water. Problems of water supply need to be addressed with huge investment, particularly in the developing world where many people have no access to decent fresh water. Even in the developed world, much water (up to 50% in Canada) is wasted through leaks in pipes and ageing infrastructure. The public sector has failed to provide the money for this investment so private involvement is essential. For this investment to be attractive to the private sector, water companies must be allowed to make a profit through realistic water charges that reflect the costs of supply. Issues of quality, equity and environmental standards can be handled through effective regulation.
Counterpoint:Yes we do pay for different utilities and necessary resources, however if they are publicly owned, the government can subsidize those costs for low-income citizens who cannot afford the full price. When governments own the utilities that provide water, they can better control the price that the poor have to pay and thus address of affordability. Additionally, just because we pay for other utilities does not justify having to pay for the most necessary resource to life.
