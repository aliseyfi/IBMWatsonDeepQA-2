Point:Universities are now under what is perhaps the most serious financial pressure they have ever faced1 - the UK government for example is cutting spending on education by up to 25%2 and allowing universities to charge higher tuition fees. Shorter degree courses will help to address these great pressures on all higher education systems. By moving students through university more quickly, they free up capacity so that the increasing demand for higher education can be met within existing resources. And as tuition fees rise in the UK3 and many other countries as a consequence of government funding cuts, students will benefit from shorter courses that will allow them to graduate with less debt.
Counterpoint:Higher education systems are under pressure at present, but shorter degree courses will not fix the problem. First of all, additional teaching weeks are not cost-free as academics will demand more money for their increased work-load and many of the resources used in a degree course (e.g. books, field visits, chemicals) will be the same regardless of how the teaching is scheduled. The University of Buckingham makes shorter courses work by charging more for lower tutor-student ratios, which implies increased costs if this were scaled up over the whole country. In addition, many poorer students part-fund their degrees by working for 20 weeks or so in their vacations1, so increasing their term lengths may actually force them either to take on more debt than at present, or deter them from pursuing higher education in the first place.
Point:If modern students are not up to the demands of higher education, they should not be going to university in the first place. The over-expansion of higher education in the last twenty years has inevitably lowered standards among undergraduates1, as well as imposing greater costs on taxpayers. A two year system would undoubtedly be more intensive, and come with considerably less time off than the current system. This would most likely discourage those who see university as simply 'something to do before getting a job', thus increasing the value of a degree once more.
Counterpoint:Suggesting that reducing the number of years for degree courses implies that currently all courses are too easy and give students too much time to do the work required. Of course this is not the case - achieving top marks in most courses is still very difficult, and reducing the amount of study time would inevitably inhibit the ability of students to study beyond the basic parameters of their course, which is a key part of university education. Geoffrey Alderman argues in The Guardian that there are many other problems with the current system which are unrelated to the number of students going through it, including the modern fixation with league table results. He argues that is is this "toxic combination of factors" that needs to change, and reducing amount of time spent at university will not affect them1.
Point:Those who left school at 16 or 18 but now want to go to college are often more serious about their studies, often with a more motivated and professional approach than 19 or 20-year-olds who have moved to university by default. We should seek to encourage such committed students, who often contribute a great deal to society and the economy upon their graduation. But mature students want focused, cost-effective courses that do not require them to take three or more years out of a career. For example, at Stafford University where 2-year courses are being trialed, Director for Academic Development Dr Steve Wyn Williams has said that "Many of our students who opt to do the fast-tracks are mature students who are looking for a career change who are often quite used to working during the summer period when they were in employment"1. It would seem then that the introduction of such courses would encourage more mature students to get better qualifications, and in the process be able to contribute more to the economy as well as learn more for themselves.
Counterpoint:Making such significant alterations to the education system in order to better accommodate one (fairly minor) subset of students seems a little extreme. A study in America showed that mature students over the age of 25 accounted for 36% of the total number of undergraduates1, and although this is a significant proportion, it is nowhere near enough to consider changing the entire university structure. In the UK the number of mature students may be even less, with 30% at Oxford Brookes classified as mature2, and only 14% at University College London3. Beyond the simple case of numbers, it is also important to consider that even in the mature section of students, shorter degree courses will not necessarily be better. Part-time courses and training for those already with careers are also widely available.
Point:By teaching students for 40 weeks a year rather than less than 30, the same amount of teaching time can be provided so that students reach degree standard faster. The University of Buckingham has shown over many years that this can be achieved with no loss of quality - they remain highly placed in comparative league tables1. At the same time laboratories and lecture theatres do not stand empty for half the year, while students still have 12 weeks of vacation in which they can read and reflect on their learning.
Counterpoint:Academic institutions are about more than churning out results - if anything this de-values the entire system to the detriment of those who are genuinely suited to real academic study. The fact remains that none of the most highly ranked universities have made a move towards shortening their courses, and while the University of Buckingham has shown that it can achieve similar results in less time, this does not automatically mean that the system is better. Recently in Britain the government has come under pressure to reduce the number of people going through the system as such a focus on numbers and statistics has, according to a report by the Association of Graduate Recruiters, "driven down standards and devalued the currency of a degree and damaged the quality of the university experience"1.
